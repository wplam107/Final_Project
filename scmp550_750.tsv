After nearly two weeks of relative calm, chaos returned to the Kowloon side of the city by evening, as a group of protesters hurled bricks and police fired tear gas, while radicals set about smashing restaurants and shops in Whampoa and vandalised the exits of the railway station there. They unleashed the destruction after a peaceful march that began in the tourist district of Tsim Sha Tsui with crowds of protesters, many of them in their trademark all-black gear but also including families with children, streaming onto the waterfront promenade. An hour after the march began, police said a group of protesters set off smoke bombs that in turn prompted the force to fire tear gas into the densely packed columns of people marching and spilling onto the roads. As the evening wore on, stand-offs again erupted between hard-core activists and police in Whampoa, a middle-class residential district next to the march’s endpoint in Hung Hom. At least three protesters were arrested. Among the shops targeted in the district were Japanese restaurant brand Yoshinoya, snack chain Best Mart 360 and China Mobile.  Police fired rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets after masked protesters hurled bricks at officers and blocked the roads. A petrol bomb was also thrown at a police van. Radicals resorted to those all-too-familiar tactics, which the city had not seen in the days leading up to and in the aftermath of last Sunday’s historic district council elections. The pro-democracy bloc won 392 out of 452 seats, in a major blow for the pro-establishment camp.  In Mong Kok, police made a handful of arrests, lining up dozens of people not dressed in the usual protester attire on Nathan Road. Earlier, protesters started a small fire on a side street. Thousands of protesters return to Hong Kong streets to reiterate five demands to government Thousands of protesters return to Hong Kong streets to reiterate five demands to government Thousands of protesters return to Hong Kong streets to reiterate five demands to government Defiant demonstrators said the massive turnout for the Sunday procession – titled “Do not forget why we started” – showed their determination not just to savour the electoral victory, but also to keep up the protests, which will enter their seventh month next week, until all their demands were met.  “We want to let the younger protesters know that they are not alone,” said KC, a 35-year-old man who joined the demonstration with his son, who is in Primary Six. “We cannot pretend and act as if everything is normal just because the pro-democracy camp has scored a victory in the district council elections.”   As protesters poured out from railway stations nearby and began filling the promenade near the water, the crowd members – some of whom waved the American flag – began chanting: “Hongkongers, take revenge!” According to the Hospital Authority, seven men and one woman were sent to hospital following clashes on Sunday night. On Monday morning, three men remained in hospital, in stable conditions. The protesters have five demands. The first, which is the withdrawal of the extradition bill that sparked the protests, has been met. extradition bill But the others have not: an independent inquiry into police’s use of force; retracting the riot label for the events of June 12; amnesty for arrested protesters; and implementation of universal suffrage. Sunday’s rally, approved by police, came after a day of relative calm. There was a smattering of small protests on Saturday but tensions spilled over in Mong Kok late at night, when police fired tear gas and pepper spray as radicals blocked roads along Nathan Road, a main artery through Kowloon. A man trying to clear some barricades was attacked by a masked man who swung a drain cover, hitting the side of his head. The victim suffered serious injuries but was discharged from hospital on Sunday. Sunday’s mass rally at Tsim Sha Tsui was one of three demonstrations that police issued a letter of no objection to. The earlier events – one to oppose the use of tear gas and the other to thank US President Donald Trump for signing legislation that could impose diplomatic action and economic sanctions on the city – were peaceful and attracted observers in the form of festive shoppers. While there had been speculation that mass violence would return to the city after the relative calm of the election period, radicals appeared to have kept a low profile – until evening came, bringing with it violence.

Police raised the blue flag, warning protesters they were taking part in an illegal assembly. Rounds of tear gas and other projectiles, including pepper balls, were fired at the packed crowd, whose number included the elderly and young people. The crowd control measures were targeted at both ends of Salisbury Road shortly before 5pm. As police urged everyone to leave, a riot officer at East Tsim Sha Tsui railway station was seen pushing over a woman, who was kneeling down pleading with them not to fire pepper spray at people. The force later said it had deployed the minimum force necessary to stop radical protesters who had thrown smoke bombs. The organiser of the march, who gave his name as Swing and described himself as an ordinary Hongkonger without any political affiliations, said police called him at 4pm to tell him the march had to be stopped immediately, rather than ending at 6pm, as originally allowed. Swing said 380,000 people took part in the march, while police estimated an attendance of 16,000 at the event’s peak. Police chief alarmed by growing number of students arrested 2 Dec 2019 Police chief alarmed by growing number of students arrested 2 Dec 2019 Protesters said the calm in the run-up to the district council elections was only for tactical purposes so the citywide polls would not be postponed. “The government needs to know we are always ready to take action. We are not letting go yet,” said Richard Lee, a secondary school student. Earlier on Sunday, about 200 peaceful protesters of all ages gathered in Central to demand that police stop using tear gas. More than 10,000 canisters of the chemical irritant have been fired since the anti-government movement began in early June. since the anti-government movement began in early June. Many participants wore surgical masks and held yellow balloons at the Edinburgh Place gathering. A significant proportion were parents with young children. They chanted slogans including “No more tear gas” and “Disband the police force” as they marched from the square, through Tamar Park and to the government’s headquarters. November was a particularly heavy month for tear gas deployment, with police launching some of the biggest bombardments of the riot control agent seen since the protests broke out in June. Later, another group of about 200 protesters gathered at Chater Garden to hail Trump for signing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. Trump signs Hong Kong human rights bill, ignoring China’s warnings 28 Nov 2019 Trump signs Hong Kong human rights bill, ignoring China’s warnings 28 Nov 2019 The rally, “Thank You US”, organised by a localist group called Hong Kong Autonomy Action (HKAA), saw people waving American flags and marching to the US consulate in Central. Last week, Trump approved legislation that could impose diplomatic action and economic sanctions against Hong Kong, much to the anger of China, which said the move amounted to meddling in the country’s internal affairs. The law, among other things, will allow Washington to suspend Hong Kong’s special trading status based on whether the city retains a sufficient degree of autonomy under the “one country, two systems” framework. It will also give the US discretion to sanction people deemed to have violated freedoms guaranteed under Hong Kong’s Basic Law, its mini-constitution.

A construction worker, who only gave his name as R, attended the event with his girlfriend – and an American flag. He acknowledged the act might adversely affect Hong Kong’s relationship with mainland China, especially in areas such as commerce. “But if we don’t keep a public discourse going and gain international support, those in power will not change their mind,” he said. Writing on their official blogs, however, ministers made no mention of the potentially punitive American legislation.    Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po, for example, said that while six months of social unrest had seriously undermined Hong Kong’s economy and disrupted people’s livelihoods, the impact on the city’s financial markets remained limited. Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung also said the city had remained competitive and not suffered a brain drain, saying the perception of talent leaving the city was wide of the mark. Meanwhile, the MTR Corporation, which has been the target of vandalism as the protests rage, announced that normal services would resume on Monday after almost two months of reduced timetables.

When Sars hit the city 16 years ago, tourist arrivals in the month of May fell more than 60 per cent from the same period the previous year. The drop in arrivals for October was also the worst decline in a single month since the city’s anti-government protests began about six months ago. anti-government protests Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau Tang-wah told the Post that tourist arrivals for the rest of this year “would not be good”. Post “The path to recovery will depend on when violence will subside,” he said.  In the first 10 months of this year, the number of visitor arrivals fell 4.7 per cent to 50 million from the same period last year. Visitor numbers from mainland China plummeted to 2.5 million arrivals in October, down 45.9 per cent from the previous month, as tourists from across the border shunned what was usually their top destination to spend the seven-day “golden week” National Day holiday at the beginning of the month. mainland China tourists Police use pepper spray as protesters at lunchtime rallies say their fight is far from over 29 Nov 2019 Police use pepper spray as protesters at lunchtime rallies say their fight is far from over 29 Nov 2019 Mainland visitors accounted for 78 per cent of the city’s total arrivals in the first 10 months of this year.  Hong Kong has been rocked by anti-government protests, sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, since June. The demonstrations have increasingly descended into violence, especially since October 5, when a government ban on wearing masks during public assemblies took effect. extradition bill The demonstrations have increasingly descended into violence, especially since October 5, when a government ban on wearing masks during public assemblies took effect. Demonstrations have frequently descended into chaos, with radical protesters hurling petrol bombs or bricks at riot police. Public facilities, metro stations and businesses with links to the mainland have been attacked and vandalised. Police officers have also fired tear gas, pepper spray, and even live rounds at protesters. ‘No more tear gas’: Protest march in Hong Kong ‘No more tear gas’: Protest march in Hong Kong ‘No more tear gas’: Protest march in Hong Kong Tourist districts such as Causeway Bay, Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok and Jordan are frequently affected.  About 40 countries or regions have so far issued travel warning or alerts for travellers heading to Hong Kong. Hong Kong Tourism lawmaker Yiu Si-wing estimated the decline in November’s tourist arrival figures would remain at a similar level with that of October’s. “Protests appear to be smaller and violence seems to have eased in the past few days,” he said. “If this persists, there is a good chance visitors from southern China cities may return in the near term.” 	SCMP

The pro-democracy camp won 392 out of 452 seats in Sunday’s vote, taking control of 17 out of 18 district councils. Although councillors’ powers are limited, the victory will give the bloc a bigger say in the selection process for the chief executive by handing them control of 117 seats on the 1,200-member committee that chooses the chief executive. This shift in the balance of power will mean that Beijing will be more reliant on the major property developers and their business associates – at a time when Beijing has been trying to wean itself away from its over-reliance on the city’s tycoons. Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing camp reeling after crushing defeat in district council elections Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing camp reeling after crushing defeat in district council elections Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing camp reeling after crushing defeat in district council elections “The impact on the chief executive election is very concerning,” Song SiO-chong, a professor at the Centre for Basic Laws of Hong Kong and Macau at Shenzhen University, said. “The business sector’s take will become very important. Some business heavyweights have the ability to swing up to 100 votes from the financial and business sector, meaning their votes will be key to the election. When the time comes, Beijing will need to do a lot of coordination work,” Song said.  The city’s 3.8 million registered voters will have no direct say on the choice of the next chief executive, with the selection committee having been designed to provide Beijing’s preferred candidate with a strong support base. A candidate needs to secure 150 nominations to run for office, and 601 votes to win in the committee, which consists of representatives from four main sectors – government bodies (including the district council bloc); industrial, commercial and financial services; the professions; and labour, social and religious groups.    The committee has been stacked with some of Hong Kong’s wealthiest tycoons, with the city’s two best-known developers – Li Ka-shing, who founded Cheung Kong, and Lee Shau-kee from Henderson Land – having sat on the committee since the first election in 1996, a year before the former British colony was handed back to China. Li Ka-shing Lee Shau-kee from Henderson Land  Last time around, 96 seats in the business sector were occupied by representatives of the developers – and 46 of these were taken up by employees or business associates of the six biggest groups – Sun Hung Kai Properties, CK Asset Holding, Henderson Land Development, New World Development, Wharf (Holdings) and Sino Land. Henderson Land Development New World Development Wharf (Holdings) Sino Land  The success of the pro-democracy camp on Sunday gives them a majority in all parts of the city and means the 117 seats selected by district councillors, previously seen as “ironclad votes” for the pro-Beijing camp, are all likely to be occupied by pan-democrats next time round. What were voters in Hong Kong district council elections saying? 28 Nov 2019 What were voters in Hong Kong district council elections saying? 28 Nov 2019 In the 2017 chief executive vote Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor secured victory over former financial secretary John Tsang Chun-wah by winning 777 votes. Analysts believe that most, if not all, district council votes went to Lam, making them one of the key factors that helped her reach the crucial 601-vote mark. Song pointed out: “If we do the maths from the 777 votes, minus the 117 votes the CE got from the district councillor sector, it would mean that Beijing’s next favoured candidate will only have a thin winning margin of 60 votes.” In 2017, 325 votes went to the pro-democracy camp and adding a further 117 votes to this total will give the group control of around one-third of the electoral committee. “While it’s unlikely that a non-Beijing appointed candidate will win the election despite the increased number of pro-democracy votes, Beijing will find it necessary to pick someone the business sectors can also support,” said Ivan Choy Chi-keung, a political scientist at Chinese University. “Beijing still needs to manage the number of votes to legitimise the final winner.” Scapegoats or scoundrels? Why ties between Beijing and Hong Kong’s property tycoons are unravelling amid protest crisis 26 Sep 2019 Scapegoats or scoundrels? Why ties between Beijing and Hong Kong’s property tycoons are unravelling amid protest crisis 26 Sep 2019 But the increased reliance on the votes of the city’s business elite in the next chief executive election presents Beijing with a dilemma. Previously it relied on them to help ensure Hong Kong’s stability, given their control of wide swathes of the city’s economy ranging from telecoms to public utilities and supermarkets, and Beijing was able to use Hong Kong’s financial and trade system to spur the mainland’s rapid economic development. In return the tycoons relied on Beijing’s favour to give them access to the mainland market. Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections But in recent years Hong Kong has seen skyrocketing property prices and a growing shortage of affordable housing, which Beijing has singled out as key factors fuelling the unrest in the city. Official media outlets such as Xinhua and People’s Daily have promoted this narrative – blaming the developers who profited from the situation and urging the city’s authorities to increase its housing stock by taking over land being hoarded by “vested interests”. People’s Daily In September, Global Times , a tabloid affiliate of People’s Daily, singled out the lack of affordable housing as a “root cause” of the protests, which started in opposition to the now-withdrawn extradition bill but have since erupted into greater calls for democracy and investigation into police use of force. Global Times Global Times People’s Daily a “root cause” of the protests What’s next for Hong Kong protesters after the high of opposition bloc’s crushing victory? 27 Nov 2019 What’s next for Hong Kong protesters after the high of opposition bloc’s crushing victory? 27 Nov 2019 A few property developers have already tried to relieve the pressure on them by donating land for public housing, but Choy suggested Beijing’s need to win the businesses sector’s unified support in the chief executive vote could pave the way for a new offer. “They will not hit out at the tycoons as they did [through state media] in recent months, and most importantly, pick a person that they will accept,” Choy said. In the past tycoons have not always supported Beijing’s choice of chief executive. In 2012 Li Ka-shing did not support Beijing’s preferred candidate. He told the media that he had known his preferred candidate, former financial secretary Henry Tang Ying-nien, was not going to win but had still chosen to support him. Tang, who was a popular candidate among the business sector, was supported by other prominent tycoons, including Lui Che-woo of K Wah Group and David Li Kwok-po, who chairs the Bank of East Asia. In the last election in 2017, Tsang, the former financial secretary, was the most popular candidate with the public, according to opinion polls. But Lam was widely seen as Beijing’s choice and only one leading real estate representative – Thomas Jefferson Wu, son of the founder of Hopewell Holdings founder, Gordon Wu Ying-shueng – nominated Tsang. But Choy said Beijing would not allow business leaders to ally with the pro-democracy camp to give them “more bargaining chips”. Lau Siu Kai, vice-chairman of semi-official think tank The Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said Beijing was likely to tighten control over the chief executive election rather than trying to court the business community’s support. He said it was likely to only allow one nominee from the pro-establishment camp and let the pro-democracy side pick its own candidate. “This is the only way Beijing can minimise the possibility of not getting enough votes for its hand-picked candidate,” Lau said. “In the past, Beijing would not feel threatened so it could accept some deviation from the pro-establishment camp … but now there cannot be any competition between pro-establishment candidates.” “In the worst case scenario, Beijing will veto the choice by not appointing the elected chief,” Lau added. Hong Kong election result a ‘wake-up call’ for China but will it listen? 26 Nov 2019 Hong Kong election result a ‘wake-up call’ for China but will it listen? 26 Nov 2019 In a directive issued at the end of the Communist Party’s policy meeting at the end of October, Beijing made it clear that it would “enhance the system and mechanism” used to select the chief executive and principal officers. “Beijing will have made its contingency plans as plain as black and white before the next CE election,” Lau said, adding that it would also put forward a system for dismissing the city’s leader. But Lau did not believe that the business sector would prove “critical” or become “kingmakers” as Beijing would find a consensus. What is the Basic Law of Hong Kong? What is the Basic Law of Hong Kong? What is the Basic Law of Hong Kong? “At such a critical moment, would anyone in the business community actually risk bargaining with Beijing and threatening to stand on the opposite side? I don’t think so,” he said. A political adviser to a leading Hong Kong property developer agreed with Lau. “It is true that [Beijing] will have a thinner margin, making the votes of the business community carry more weight,” said the adviser, who asked not to be named. “But that only means Beijing will need to make greater efforts to ‘persuade’ [them] and I think, in most cases, the business community can be and will be ‘persuaded’.” Time for Beijing to ‘rethink Hong Kong script’ after pan-democrat landslide 1 Dec 2019 Time for Beijing to ‘rethink Hong Kong script’ after pan-democrat landslide 1 Dec 2019 However, not all business electors were convinced. Pro-establishment lawmaker and tycoon Michael Tien Puk-sun, who was also an elector in the previous chief executive election, said he still hoped the committee would be given some leeway. “This situation could be a good thing for Hong Kong, if the business sector has a greater say, because it means that there will be more discussions and consultation over a suitable candidate,” Tien said. Tien said that he expected Beijing to put forward two candidates it found acceptable and let the electors choose. But he said this plan would only work if the pan-democrats were willing to compromise. “It’s not easy, but this is the practical way, since [the pan-democrats’] candidate would not win anyway,” he said. “If the central government continues with its hardline approach, and the pan-democrats keep taking an obstructive stance … then there will be an impasse. Isn’t this exactly what has led Hong Kong to where we are today?” 	SCMP

Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act But he also suggested that signing the bill and enacting it are two different matters. China reacted to the signing with the expected anger and outrage on Thursday, blasting the United States for “interfering in China’s domestic affairs”. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also called in US ambassador Terry Branstad to lodge its protest. And observers noted that Beijing may well temporarily put the brakes on trade talks with Washington to show its displeasure. However, the same observers indicated the devil was in the details and those details were in the statement released by the White House on Wednesday and Trump’s comments. US President Donald Trump signs Hong Kong human rights bills into law US President Donald Trump signs Hong Kong human rights bills into law US President Donald Trump signs Hong Kong human rights bills into law Trump spoke of his respect for Chinese President Xi Jinping as well as the people in Hong Kong. He said the bills – which also included the Protect Hong Kong Act – “are being enacted in the hope that leaders and representatives of China and Hong Kong will be able to amicably settle their differences leading to long-term peace and prosperity for all”. Protect Hong Kong Act  He also showed his displeasure with Congress and what he saw as its “intervention” in his foreign policy. As he signed the bills, Trump said that “certain provisions … would interfere with the exercise of the president’s constitutional authority to state the foreign policy of the United States”. These comments were Trump’s message to Beijing that implementation of the law would be at his discretion, said Gal Luft, co-director of the US-based Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, Trump signs Hong Kong act into law, brushing off China’s warnings 28 Nov 2019 Trump signs Hong Kong act into law, brushing off China’s warnings 28 Nov 2019 “In this he signalled to Xi that he had no choice in the face of a vetoproof bill but he could control the enforcement of the new law if Xi gives him his desired [trade] deal,” Luft said.  He said that the main initial casualty of Trump signing the democracy bill could be the US stock market if investors foresaw a delay in the trade negotiations.  “Investors seeing the prospects for a deal fading may panic and this could trigger a rerun of last year’s December stock market crash, when an entire year’s gains were erased in just a few days,” he said, noting that Trump signed the bills after the closing bell to avoid a stock slump ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.    Delays in trade talks could also hurt American farmers, who are preparing for next year’s planting season and need clarity on the future of the Chinese market, Luft added. This is a key constituency for Trump if he wants their support in next November’s presidential election, he said. But no observer expected the trade negotiations to be derailed, as both Trump and Xi wanted to sign a deal. Trump, mired in an impeachment investigation, needs to bring good news to his base in the rural farmlands. At the same time, Xi is facing mounting pressure from a slowing economy, which has seen growth fall to its lowest in nearly three decades – worsened by the biting trade tariffs imposed by the US. China summons US diplomat, vows to retaliate if Trump signs Hong Kong democracy act 21 Nov 2019 China summons US diplomat, vows to retaliate if Trump signs Hong Kong democracy act 21 Nov 2019 “It won’t have a fundamental impact on the trade talks as both sides still urgently need an interim deal to de-escalate the trade tensions,” said Huang Jing, a US specialist at Beijing Language and Culture University’s Institute of International and Regional Studies. In addition, China has few options to retaliate against the US for passing the Hong Kong democracy bill, which conditions Hong Kong’s special economic and trading relations with the US on its autonomy from Beijing. The US could also impose sanctions on officials for human rights abuses in the special administrative region. “We don’t have many cards on our hands apart from protesting,” admitted an adviser to the Chinese government, who declined to be named. “Right now, what China and the US need is to solve problems between them, not create more and more problems.” US-China trade deal in “final throes”, says Trump but we’re watching Hong Kong US-China trade deal in “final throes”, says Trump but we’re watching Hong Kong US-China trade deal in “final throes”, says Trump but we’re watching Hong Kong Huang agreed. “I don’t think the Chinese side has figured out what they could do to retaliate. It’s more about posturing and making its stance known than anything else,” he said. In the past, China has typically shown its displeasure with a foreign government by “weaponising” its overseas tourism or similar measures. But most specialists do not expect China to use this method against the US. One milder, passive-aggressive form of retaliation the Chinese could take, however, was to slow things down in the trade negotiations and push the “phase one” agreement – originally expected to be signed by the end of this month – to next year, they said. “[Xi Jinping] can’t be seen as eager to cut a deal with the US three or four weeks after they did this perceived ‘interference’ in China’s internal affairs,” said David Zweig, emeritus professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. “They may slow things down, they might not answer phone calls, they may drag their feet more.”   Moreover, Trump had no choice but to sign the veto-proofed bills – a fact that Beijing was well aware of, analysts said. Unanimously passed by both the House and the Senate, the bills would eventually come into law as Congress could easily override Trump’s veto with a two-thirds vote. “Trump really had no choice. He’s pretty much squeezed. He can’t afford to have a fight with the Republican caucus now, during the impeachment process. He has to be 100 per cent on board, ” Zweig said. And if Trump is seen as dragging his feet on implementation of the Hong Kong bill, it will be members of the US Congress attacking him – not China. “This bicameral, bipartisan law reaffirms our nation’s commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of law in the face of Beijing’s crackdown,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. “I am pleased that the president signed this legislation and look forward to its prompt enforcement.” 	SCMP

Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor Lam had held the consultation on September 26 to understand the concerns of residents and discuss ways to ease anti-government protests, sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, that have rocked the city for months. anti-government protests Some 76.2 per cent of those polled said the dialogue was “ineffective” or “very ineffective” in easing social tensions, while 63.8 per cent said the authorities had to meet the demand by demonstrators to form an independent commission of inquiry into the use of police force during the protests. ‘No more tear gas’: Protest march in Hong Kong ‘No more tear gas’: Protest march in Hong Kong ‘No more tear gas’: Protest march in Hong Kong Lam’s public dialogue saw 130 people selected at random to participate in the event, which had attracted applications from more than 20,000 Hong Kong residents. However, only 30 participants had a chance to air their views with the chief executive. About half of those who spoke in the three-hour session urged Lam to establish an independent inquiry into the use of police force. MWYO’s poll, carried out between November 6 and 9, found that two in five respondents believed a community dialogue would only be successful if the government addressed all five demands by protesters, including universal suffrage for Hong Kong.

Almost one in five respondents thought that no one could facilitate an effective dialogue. Almost one in five respondents thought that no one could facilitate an effective dialogue. Meanwhile, the survey also reflected the political divide in the city, with half of respondents saying that it was “not possible” to hold a dialogue between people with different stances.  Hong Kong has been in the throes of nearly six months of social unrest, after protests sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill morphed into an anti-government movement that has led demonstrators to make four other demands, including amnesty for arrested protesters; a halt to labelling the protests as riots; an independent probe into the use of force by police; and the implementation of universal suffrage. The extradition bill would have allowed criminal suspects to be transferred to places where Hong Kong does not have an extradition agreement with, including mainland China.

Lau Ming-wai, 39, the founder of MWYO, said the poll results indicated a high level of frustration among Hong Kong residents.  “The results of this survey and the recent District Council elections give a strong indication of distress and dissatisfaction among Hongkongers,” said Lau, who is the son of property tycoon Joseph Lau Luen-hung.

The rankings by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) were released on Wednesday after Hong Kong campuses emerged as new battlegrounds for violent clashes between radical protesters and police, following months of anti-government unrest sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. The campus chaos has led to an exodus of students from mainland China and overseas, widespread suspension of classes, severe damage to learning facilities and the mass arrests of university-goers. In the Asia edition of the QS World University Rankings 2020, the University of Hong Kong fell from second to third after it was overtaken by the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. the University of Hong Kong fell from second to third after it was overtaken by the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.   The university judged to be the best in Asia is the National University of Singapore, which was ranked No 1 for a second consecutive year. The University of Science and Technology and Chinese University, both in Hong Kong, each also slipped one place from last year, ranking eighth and 10th respectively.  Using measures such as employer reputation and student-staff ratios, the publication assesses 550 universities from 17 parts of Asia. Three other Hong Kong universities in the top 100 climbed the table: City University, which rose two places to 19th; Polytechnic University, which jumped from 31 to 25; and Baptist University, up from 65 to 58.  QS, a Britain-based education information firm, said in a statement that the top three Hong Kong universities had fallen slightly on 2019, saying it was “perhaps best to regard these shifts as normal annual variation”. “perhaps best to regard these shifts as normal annual variation”. A spokeswoman told the ﻿South China Morning Post: “The reality is that the rankings are not yet reflecting the civil unrest which is happening [in Hong Kong]”. South China Morning Post  She said data for this year’s Asia rankings were collected by July and analysis completed in August, so the full impact of the protests had “not been factored in”. She added it would usually take a few years for the political situation in cities to be reflected in the rankings, due to the methodology in compiling them.

Night clashes around Hong Kong Polytechnic University Night clashes around Hong Kong Polytechnic University Night clashes around Hong Kong Polytechnic University Polytechnic University said its rise was a “recognition of their efforts in teaching and research”, but did not comment on whether the occupation of its Hung Hom campus would have an impact in the future. Officers have besieged the campus since November 17, when protesters barricaded themselves inside the university after a hard-core group had engaged in extreme violence in the area that police called a riot. The assessments for the QS rankings were conducted using worldwide surveys from academics and graduate employers, as well as information provided by citation databases and universities themselves.

Separately, in the World Rankings by Subject for 2020 released by Times Higher Education (THE) last week, Chinese University tumbled 42 places in law to 91st.

The pro-democracy camp’s crushing victory in Hong Kong’s district council elections has left anti-government protesters pondering how to keep the momentum going until all of their five key demands are met, as they next seek to break the pro-establishment bloc’s dominance in the legislature. Some protesters believed the democrats elected on Sunday should lay the groundwork for the Legislative Council election in September next year by spreading their political ideology at the district level. Others thought radicals would continue to block roads and vandalise metro stations, as peaceful protesters had largely not turned their backs on the movement despite recent violent clashes with police. “I felt exhausted a long time ago. But our five key demands have still not been met and there’s no reason to stop at this moment,” said frontline protester Wong, 31, referring to demands including the establishment of a judge-led inquiry into police actions since protests erupted in June, sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill. extradition bill Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Wong, a teacher, believed the radicals would continue to adopt guerilla tactics, saying Hong Kong had been peaceful for the past week because protesters needed a rest.

Starry Lee Wai-king, chairwoman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, called on the embattled government to deeply reflect on its work in restoring law and order after more than five months of increasingly violent protests in the city but sidestepped questions on their future relations. The DAB fielded 181 candidates in Sunday’s poll, which had been seen as a barometer on how Hongkongers felt about the months-long political crisis gripping the city, but won just 21 seats, compared with having 117 incumbents before the poll. The opposition pan-democrat camp took 347 of the 452 council seats up for grabs. Speaking to the media on Monday morning, Lee and six other party leaders bowed to apologise to their supporters for the drubbing, the biggest defeat in the DAB’s history. Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections “Drastic changes have appeared in the city for the past five months, with violence and social unrest showing no signs of abating,” she said. “We understand that the public is discontented with the situation and worried about the future.” Asked if the party was a victim of the government’s unpopularity, Lee said they were not looking for excuses and would examine multiple factors behind the results before drawing any conclusions.  “I hope the government will deeply reflect on its work, especially its work on restoring law and order over the past few months,” Lee added. The protests, sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill in June, have evolved into a wider anti-government campaign, in which demonstrators are seeking five core demands including an independent inquiry into police actions and an amnesty for those arrested over the unrest. Lee, asked if Sunday’s election results would force the DAB to listen to the public and support the five demands, particularly the setting up of an inquiry into police’s use of force during protests, merely said the party would unite their supporters first and then fully reflect.  She narrowly defeated “Long Hair” Leung Kwok-hung of the League of Social Democrats to retain the To Kwa Wan North seat on Kowloon City District Council, but DAB lawmakers Horace Cheung Kwok-kwan, Holden Chow Ho-ding, Vincent Cheng Wing-shun and Edward Lau kwok-fun were all unseated.    Cheung said the DAB’s central committee wanted Lee to stay and lead the party forward despite suffering its heaviest thumping ever.  “We unanimously decided that our chairwoman should remain as the leader of our party to face the coming challenge,” he said. Another pro-Beijing group, the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, also had a disastrous night, retaining just four seats after fielding 62 candidates, down from the 29 it won in 2015 district elections. FTU lawmaker Alice Mak Mei-kuen, a defeated candidate, said their poll hammering was not their fault, but due to the “overall political environment”. Mak, who was ousted by the Civic Party’s Henry Sin Ho-fai in the Wai Ying constituency of Kwai Tsing council, reportedly used a profanity against Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor in a closed-door meeting in June over her handling of the extradition bill saga. Party president Stanley Ng Chau-pei insisted the election was not a referendum on the government’s strategy of “stopping violence”, and stressed it should remain a top priority for the administration. “Many of the candidates parachuted into this election have a so-called peaceful, rational and non-violent manifesto, and run on different platforms. So it is not a referendum on the strategy of stopping violence,” he said. Ng, who will not step down from his position as president, also put on a brave face on Monday morning, saying the FTU received about 180,000 votes, up from 95,583 four years ago. But it also stood 11 more candidates than its 51 in 2015. He would not be drawn on whether the FTU should remain a close ally of Lam’s government, saying only it would “support policies that deserve supporting”. 	SCMP

Beijing has accused the West, especially the United States and “opposition parties and politicians” in Hong Kong, of fuelling protests triggered by a now withdrawn extradition bill that have since developed into calls for democratic reforms and an investigation into police use of force against the protesters. Mei Xinyu, an economist affiliated with the Ministry of Commerce, said on Monday morning that “the landslide defeat in the Hong Kong district council elections could be a good thing if it resulted in deep reflection”.  “The mess in Hong Kong and a big defeat in the district council elections will hopefully kick-start rumination on its own Zunyi Conference,” Mei said in an online post, referring to a meeting of Communist Party leaders in 1935 that resulted in a personnel reshuffle and endorsed Mao Zedong’s leadership of the party and military. Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections In an opinion piece published after the election results, state tabloid Global Times said the outcome should not be understood as a sign of support for “mobs”. Global Times “It is both inconceivable and totally impossible that most Hongkongers would encourage violence, support political confrontation against the mainland, and back the city to become a bridgehead for US political forces to pressure China,” the article said.  But it also accused “Western forces” of backing the opposition in the elections.  “It must be pointed out that the West has been helping the Hong Kong opposition in district council elections in the past week,” it said. The article cited various overseas media reports last week as evidence of that help, including reports that Simon Cheng Man-kit, a former employee of the British consulate in Hong Kong, claimed to have been tortured during 15 days of detention on the mainland amid the protests. Simon Cheng Man-kit   Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin urged pro-Beijing supporters not to be discouraged by the results, saying they should see them “as a foundation for the country to face the practical issues in Hong Kong and a focus to improve future work”.

Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted As the ballot count continued into Monday morning, influential mainland commentator Ren Yi compared the elections in Hong Kong to a “referendum”, calling it “the only credible opinion poll”. Ren Yi “Both the pro-establishment and pro-democracy camps have been politicising the elections, asking people to vote to have their voice heard on the political unrest … All parties [in Hong Kong] are driving people to vote in the ‘referendum’,” Ren wrote on his Chairman Rabbit WeChat account. Ren, who has more than a million followers on Weibo, is regarded as very influential among Chinese officials. “Hong Kong has been lacking a credible opinion poll, there has not even been a credible exit poll, so presumably both camps have no clear understanding of the election results and need to understand public opinion through this election,” he said, adding it would be necessary to study the demography of voting results. Ren has published frequently on Hong Kong with a hawkish view towards the protesters. 	SCMP

On November 11, radical demonstrators dropped objects from a bridge at the university onto Tolo Highway and railway tracks beneath, marking the beginning of a five-day occupation of the campus. Clashes later broke out between the protesters and police, who fired tear gas after they were attacked with petrol bombs, ­arrows and even catapults. The protesters retreated on November 15. The Post later learned that more than 8,000 petrol bombs had been found at the campus. Post  Most of the Sha Tin site reopened on Monday, although some areas that suffered the most intense bombardments of tear gas and petrol bombs were still no-go zones. Despite the grounds being shut from November 14, some felt it premature for people to return in case there were still traces of chemical irritants and other harmful substances. The University railway station, which was extensively damaged by hard-core protesters, has been closed since November 12. Ten shuttle buses were arranged for staff to travel from Tai Po Market MTR station to the main campus on Monday morning.  Mr Szeto, 32, a member of staff at the office of student affairs, who was wearing a mask, was among those who believed the campus was “not fit to reopen”.  “I feel that university management has been a bit irresponsible,” he said. He added reopening the campus was an “inappropriate decision” given results for tests on dioxin residues had not been released yet. He said he had to leave home from Tin Shui Wai an hour early at 6am on Monday, in a journey that took him about two hours. Ms Li, 28, who works in administration at the university, said she had prepared her own lunchbox on Monday because she suspected food and water supplies in the canteens might be polluted.

Students living on-site had been asked to leave the campus after the university ended its first term two weeks early on November 13, in the face of escalating protests and traffic disruption. Some were allowed to pack their belongings on Monday. They were promised that accommodation fees would be partly refunded.    A first-year science student, surnamed Siu, said her dormitory closed about two weeks ago and she had not returned since. She was packing her belongings on Monday and reflecting on how abruptly term had ended. “We were still having lessons just a few weeks ago and now everything has stopped,” she said. “I really didn’t expect politics would affect a university like that, turning the campus into a war zone, and there was nothing I could do.” A third-year student from mainland China said he had stayed at his home in Shenzhen for the past two weeks, leaving when many of his peers were fleeing amid the clashes.

At the university’s No 2 bridge – above the Tolo Highway and railway tracks where protesters threw objects to block traffic – the area remained sealed off, while concrete blocks and plastic hoarding was set up on the bridge. For safety reasons, the university has cordoned off the area, which hosted some of the most violent exchanges of this month’s outbreak of violence on campuses, to everybody except those providing emergency or essential work there. Many umbrellas, loose bricks, fire extinguishers, as well of dozens of glass bottles likely to have been used as petrol bombs, were still scattered across the area.

The result was seen as a rebuke of the city’s leader and pro-establishment parties after more than five months of anti-government protests. It also comes in the midst of heated campaigning for Taiwan’s own presidential and legislative elections in January. Taiwan’s own presidential and legislative elections in January Taiwan Presidential Office spokesman Ernesto Ting Yun-kung said the government “highly admired and supported” the Hong Kong people’s desire for freedom and democracy, calling on Beijing and the Hong Kong government to implement its democratic promises for the city. “The will of the people is like a mountain,” Ting said on Monday. “Only by taking the path of genuinely engaging in dialogue with the people can there be a true resolution of the various problems and conflicts.” Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections The mainland-friendly opposition Kuomintang (KMT) also urged the Hong Kong government to “directly face the will of the people”, in an election it said reflected public distrust of governance from mainland China.  But it also rejected Taiwanese independence, repeating calls for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. “We hope that after the election, we will see Beijing and the Hong Kong government value the people’s will and take steps to repair divisions among the Hong Kong people,” the KMT said. “We hope to see Hong Kong have genuine universal suffrage as soon as possible.

Analysts said this added momentum to Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen’s re-election race against Kaohsiung mayor Han Kuo-yu, from the KMT.  Both the KMT and Tsai’s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party have rejected the “one country, two systems” political framework of governance Beijing has proposed for Taiwan. one country, two systems” Beijing considers the self-ruled island its own territory and has vowed to bring it into its fold, by force if necessary. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said the ruling Communist Party in Beijing and the Hong Kong government needed to “correctly interpret” the district council election results, and respond to the Hong Kong people with “peaceful and rational dialogue rather than suppression and force”. “We urge them to listen to the people’s voices, and respond actively and positively,” the MAC said. “This is the only effective way to allow Hong Kong society to return to stability as soon as possible.” Pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong began in early June over a now-withdrawn extradition bill but have since expanded to include demands for an investigation into police use of force and universal suffrage, in the biggest political crisis the city has seen since 1997.

They also vowed to look to the future and work on livelihood issues, to avoid a repeat of losses suffered in 2007. The Democratic Party more than doubled its seat count from 43 to 91 on Sunday, dislodging the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong as the city’s biggest party at the local level. It urged city leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to step down and respect the five demands of the anti-government protesters. The demands include an independent inquiry into allegations of police brutality and amnesty for arrested demonstrators. Identity politics reigns over community issues in district elections: analysts 26 Nov 2019 Identity politics reigns over community issues in district elections: analysts 26 Nov 2019 “The results are beyond candidates’ personal effort, being part of the movement from all the protesters; all the people being hurt and arrested. We have to bear in mind that that’s the basis of the support,” party chairman Wu Chi-wai said. “We have to use all our efforts so the five demands have to be met in the near future.”  Wu added that “any responsible government must respond to the calls of the public, including a reshuffle in the administration, and Carrie Lam must step down”. He said the government ignoring the five demands could cause residents to lose faith in peaceful means of political expression, leading to escalated confrontations. He urged Beijing to respect Hongkongers’ democratic aspirations and relaunch discussions on electoral reform. The bloc now dominates 17 out of 18 districts, having dealt the pro-establishment its most serious blow ever and unseating veteran councillors and legislators. The only council held by the pro-establishment camp was in Islands district, where eight seats on the 18-member body are handed automatically to pro-establishment rural chiefs.  Top of the pan-democrats’ agenda was the siege at Polytechnic University, where a dwindling number of students have been blockaded by police for more than a week. Members planned to head to the campus and “save” the protesters inside.  Another pro-democracy party, the Civic Party, is now the second most represented group on district councils, having captured 32 seats. It also warned that Sunday’s results paved the way for the last opportunity for the local and central governments to resolve the impasse. Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections “The voice coming from the ballot box is loud and clear: we want Carrie Lam to withdraw the police from PolyU ... we want the current administration to consider resignation, from the top down to all politically accountable secretaries and Executive Council members,” party chairman and former lawmaker Alan Leong Ka-kit said. Asked whether the party would enter talks with Beijing over electoral reform, Leong said it would “engage in a dialogue with anybody to maintain Hong Kong ... to sustain our core values such as human rights, freedom, the rule of law, and our way of life”. Wu echoed the support for the PolyU protesters, saying: “We hope the government can end the police’s siege in the area, and we can seek a peaceful resolution to the problem.” After their victory, pan-democrats were already eyeing the long term. The voice coming from the ballot box is loud and clear: we want Carrie Lam to withdraw the police from PolyU ... we want the current administration to consider resignation, from the top down to all politically accountable secretaries and Executive Council members Alan Leong, Civic Party chairman Wu and another veteran politician Lee Wing-tat said they needed to avoid a setback similar to that of the 2007 district council elections, which reversed the gains of four years earlier. The success of 2003 was, like that of this year, powered in part by outcry over a government legal change. In that case it was national security legislation, while the current protest crisis was sparked by a bill, now suspended, which would have allowed transfers of fugitives to mainland China. Wu, a district councillor of 20 years, said his grouping was mindful not to take voters for granted, and would use district councils as platforms to improve livelihood conditions. But the camp would also use the consultative bodies to political ends, and put pressure on the administration, much as its rival bloc did previously, he said. “If all 18 district councils in the future all pass a resolution to call for the inquiry [into alleged police brutality], will the government attach the same gravity to that? If so, then the district councils could really act as a bridge between the people and the establishment,” Wu said. The Civic Party also warned of history repeating itself, and said the camp must reach out to government supporters despite the polarised climate. “As a responsible political party, we have to understand why they would have supported such an administration … They must have a reason. If there are things to be done, then do them,” Leong said. The election results also mean the camp its likely to control about a third of the election committee which will pick the next chief executive in 2022. But Wu downplayed the importance of that development, saying the bloc would only use it as a bargaining chip to get democratic reform from Beijing. ends ends 	SCMP

But the 16-year-old, whose name has been withheld for legal reasons, remained in jail after acting chief magistrate Victor So Wai-tak turned down his bail application pending an appeal at the High Court. The boy, who was 15 at the time of the offence, had been remanded in custody since his arrest on September 21, when he was found carrying a laser pointer, a modified umbrella and a hiking stick near the bus terminal at Tuen Mun MTR station, during a demonstration in the rural town. Earlier this month at West Kowloon Magistrates’ Court, So found the student guilty of possession of an offensive weapon with intent, for carrying the umbrella and the stick. He also convicted him of possession of an offensive weapon in a public place for carrying the laser pointer, which he ruled was not an offensive weapon in itself but could become one if used to harm the eyes of police officers. Earlier this month The law requires the student to serve a period of three to nine months in two rehabilitation centres, where he will receive disciplinary training, workplace training and psychological counselling. The Correctional Services Department will finalise the length of the sentence based on his behaviour. On Monday at the same court, defence counsel Peter Chiu Ka-ming asked the court to impose a jail term, which would enable the secondary school pupil’s immediate release because of time served, and allow him to continue his studies.  “Jail has been a huge punishment to him,” Chiu said. “I ask the court to give him a chance to resume education and be a normal secondary school student again.” But the magistrate said a deterrent sentence was inevitable, because the student’s acts posed “serious threats” to police officers, disrupted social order and prevented others from exercising their right to free expression.

Citing three reports, So found it was not suitable to send him to a detention centre, which focuses on discipline through physical labour, or a training centre, which serves a similar function to a rehabilitation centre but with a longer statutory sentencing period.  But the magistrate told the teenager, who suffers attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and has a record of consuming cannabis, that sending him to a rehabilitation centre could correct his behavioural problems.    “Your 72-year-old father has had a hard time taking care of you and your brother. Set a goal to yourself that you would return the favour to him in the future,” the magistrate added.

The anti-government anger boiling up over nearly six months of protests made its mark in polling stations across Hong Kong on Sunday, when voters turned out in their droves to back the pan-democrats over their pro-establishment rivals. By noon on Monday, the pro-democracy camp seized 17 out of 18 district councils, taking more than 340 of the 452 seats. All councils were previously under pro-establishment control after its candidates dominated the 2015 elections. Islands district – which has 10 elected seats and eight given automatically to pro-establishment rural chiefs – was the only one held by the pro-Beijing camp. Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections In the past, Hong Kong voters generally elected their Legislative Council representatives based on their views on the city’s relationship with Beijing, while district council candidates were typically assessed on what they offered to the local community, such as the provision of leisure and welfare services. City University political scientist Dr Edmund Cheng Wai said the results showed that district-level work was no longer the most important factor.  “A lot of young candidates with little experience in district work won seats. As some experienced district councillors were re-elected with a bigger margin, we can say that district work is now a moderating factor. The most important is your political stance,” he said. Will election win make pan-democrats the kingmakers of next Hong Kong leader? 25 Nov 2019 Will election win make pan-democrats the kingmakers of next Hong Kong leader? 25 Nov 2019 The academic also added it would be challenging for newly elected district councillors to deliver on their promises and strengthen their local support, because he said government officials had shown some extra reluctance in cooperating with pro-democracy councillors. In the run-up to the district council elections, pro-establishment politicians have strongly condemned radical protesters for seriously disrupting the city by blocking key arteries such as the Tolo Highway and the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, and using violent means such as vandalising train stations and throwing petrol bombs to advance their cause. While some pro-Beijing lawmakers called for the “silent majority” in Hong Kong to vote for pro-establishment candidates, to register their disapproval of violence and chaos, some in the camp still believed community issues would play a significant part.  Political scientist Dr Samson Yuen Wai-hei, of Lingnan University, said the election results suggested the notion a large section of the electorate were hidden supporters of the pro-establishment was “wishful thinking”.  “The pan-democratic camp said this election would be a referendum on protesters’ demands, and it worked, but the pro-establishment, as a camp, did not call it a referendum,” Yuen said. “In the end, the pro-establishment camp’s supporters, which accounted for about 40 per cent of the electorate, came out to vote, but we didn’t see what they described as a silent majority.” Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted Hong Kong elections: pro-Beijing camp left reeling from landslide defeat 25 Nov 2019 Hong Kong elections: pro-Beijing camp left reeling from landslide defeat 25 Nov 2019 Yuen believed that with the landslide defeat, the straining ties between the pro-establishment camp and the city’s embattled leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor would further decline.

Cheng also said the pro-establishment camp had few options, in the current political system, but to support the government and Beijing. That meant the election result would not significantly change the camp’s relationship with the government in the long run, he added. 	SCMP

Beijing has also called on US President Donald Trump not to sign into a law a bill passed by the US Senate and House of Representatives last week Hong Kong has been rocked by months of anti-government protests triggered by a now withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed the city to send fugitives to mainland China for trial.

Geoffrey Ma Tao-li was speaking publicly for the first time since Beijing said the power to interpret the Basic Law rested solely with the nation’s top legislative body, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC). Last week, Zang Tiewei, spokesman for the NPCSC’s Legislative Affairs Commission, attacked a High Court ruling that led to the suspension of the city government’s mask ban. His further assertion, that the power to rule on a law’s constitutionality was the preserve of the committee, drew opposition from local legal experts. His further assertion Speaking on Sunday evening at a gala dinner on the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the University of Hong Kong’s law school, Ma renewed calls for a proper understanding of the city’s legal system when a local court ruling is being criticised. The chief justice did not directly mention Zang’s remark. Police can still tell people to remove masks despite court move, force says 23 Nov 2019 Police can still tell people to remove masks despite court move, force says 23 Nov 2019 “Our legal system rests on fundamental principles and features, such as equality before the law; determination of disputes strictly in accordance with the law; the presumption of innocence; the guarantee of a fair trial; and, above all, the independence of the judiciary,” Ma said during an address to the event. “These and others are all the features of common law, and it’s important to understand that they are guaranteed and spelled out in the clearest of terms in the Basic Law.”  He continued that the Basic Law reflects the “implementation of the basic policy of the People’s Republic of China over Hong Kong”, adding that that should be the starting point of any criticism. “So when I hear commentaries about ... the outcomes of cases before the court or about our legal system … I turn to basics, and those are largely contained in the Basic Law. All these would be obvious to any law students, and certainly to any lawyers.” Graduation ceremony halted after masked university students rally at the event in Hong Kong Graduation ceremony halted after masked university students rally at the event in Hong Kong Graduation ceremony halted after masked university students rally at the event in Hong Kong Ma stressed that the system of common law had served the Hong Kong community well, with the benefit of a world-class legal profession and a well-respected judiciary.

In a thundering rebuke to the city’s government, Hongkongers – or 71.2 per cent of voters – turned out in record numbers for the city’s district council elections on Sunday to deliver a seismic victory for the pro-democracy bloc. The democrats won majorities in at least 17 of the 18 district councils, as they pummeled their pro-Beijing rivals, who lost more than 250 seats from 2015. won majorities in at least 17 of the 18 district councils Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections The citywide elections were regarded as a de facto referendum on the city’s protests, which have rocked the city since June, as well as the government’s response. Here are the six key takeaways from the polls: rocked the city since June 1. Tectonic shift in political landscape 1. Tectonic shift in political landscape Hong Kong’s pro-democracy bloc swept up almost 80 per cent of the 452 seats up for grabs in Sunday’s district council elections. Riding on the anti-establishment momentum built up by over nearly six months of unrest, democrats scored victories, not only in their usual strongholds, but also the so-called “deep red” constituencies, which for years have been dominated by the Beijing-friendly camp. democrats scored victories, not only in their usual strongholds, but also the so-called “deep red” constituencies, which for years have been dominated by the Beijing-friendly camp. Middle-class Hong Kong areas record huge turnouts as voters want voice heard 25 Nov 2019 Middle-class Hong Kong areas record huge turnouts as voters want voice heard 25 Nov 2019   Political scientist Dr Ma Ngok, of Chinese University, described the results as “surreal”. “Hongkongers have sent a resounding and clear message to the government that they support the social movement and there isn’t any change of public opinion,” he said, referring to the increasingly violent protests over the past weeks. Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted Civil Human Rights Front convenor Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, who won in Lek Yuen constituency, urged Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to listen to the voice of the people.  The government continued to be dismissive of public opinion showcased in massive rallies and opinion polls, he said, warning it must not now shy away from the clear message from these elections.  “It is time for the government to address our five demands,” said Sham, referring to protesters’ calls, which include an independent probe into police’s handling of protests and the implementation of universal suffrage. 2. Occupy leaders, key players of protest movement win big 2. Occupy leaders, key players of protest movement win big At least three student leaders, who co-led the pro-democracy Occupy movement in 2014, were successfully returned as district councillors in their maiden electoral bids. Former deputy secretary-general of Hong Kong Federation of Students (HKFS) Lester Shum, one of the five students involved in talks with government officials over the protests five years ago, bagged 5,113 votes in Tsuen Wan’s Hoi Bun constituency, unseating the incumbent councillor Chow Ping-tim, who served the area for seven terms but received only 1,974 votes on Sunday. Tommy Cheung Sau-yin, 25, who was ordered to complete 200 hours of community service after being found guilty for his role in Occupy earlier this year, beat the pro-establishment incumbent Wilson Wong Wai-shun in Yuen Lung constituency in Yuen Long. Occupy leaders found guilty over role in Hong Kong’s umbrella movement 23 Apr 2019 Occupy leaders found guilty over role in Hong Kong’s umbrella movement 23 Apr 2019 Eddie Chan Shu-fai, former secretary-general of HKFS and former president of Lingnan University’s student union, won in Hung Fuk constituency, also in Yuen Long. Both Shum and Chan joined pro-democracy and environmentalist lawmaker Eddie Chu Hoi-dick’s team after graduating from university. Two victims of police brutality during the Occupy movement are also among the newly elected. They are Ken Tsang Kin-chiu, who was assaulted by seven policemen, and Osman Cheng Chung-hang, who was hit by the baton of retired senior police officer Frankly Chu. assaulted by seven policemen hit by the baton of retired senior police officer In his victory speech, 26-year old Shum said the pro-democracy camp must not rest on its laurels.    “The results showed that many voters have wanted to show their support to the movement and the five key demands we have, as well as their dissatisfaction with the government,” he said. “We could be happy for tonight and take a rest tomorrow, but we would need to keep up our fight the day after to fight for the future of Hong Kong.” 3. Will pan-democrats repeat history by squandering surge? 3. Will pan-democrats repeat history by squandering surge? The scenes on Sunday night gave the pro-democracy camp a sense of déjà vu. In 2003, the bloc also secured a landslide victory after 500,000 people took to the streets to oppose proposals to bring in national security laws under Article 23 of the Basic Law. But the honeymoon period did not last long as the Beijing-friendly camp soon made a strong comeback in the 2007 polls, regaining most of the seats it lost following a vigorous shake-up of leadership and the allocation of more financial resources. Some pan-democrats who failed to secure a second term were blamed for focusing solely on political slogans and not putting enough effort into community work. community work. On Sunday, the camp appeared to be well aware of past mistakes. Beijing must reassess Hong Kong as pro-democracy camp wins big, say analysts 25 Nov 2019 Beijing must reassess Hong Kong as pro-democracy camp wins big, say analysts 25 Nov 2019 Both Jimmy Sham and Tommy Cheung called on their allies to give their all throughout the four-year terms they secured. “We need to demonstrate that the supporters of democracy are more outstanding than those who support the establishment,” Sham said.    Dr Ma Ngok said he did not think mistakes would be repeated by the pro-democracy side. He noted most of the newcomers were young, and he believed they would be committed councillors. But Ma said the camp should take the precious opportunity to fight for systematic reform so councillors could enjoy more power and greater autonomy in making decisions. “It is going to be a constant struggle with the government.” Ma said. 4. Conducting the postmortem: how will pro-establishment recover from heavy losses? 4. Conducting the postmortem: how will pro-establishment recover from heavy losses? The Beijing-friendly camp suffered heavy losses in the polls by losing at least 241 seats from 2015. In a disastrous performance, the city’s largest pro-establishment party, Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), only managed to secure 21 seats despite fielding 181 candidates. Hong Kong stocks rally on hopes election results could mean violent protests subside 26 Nov 2019 Hong Kong stocks rally on hopes election results could mean violent protests subside 26 Nov 2019 Nine of the 13 pro-Beijing lawmakers who sought re-election at district councils were defeated, with many losing by large margins. Federation of Trade Unions’ Luk Chung-hung failed to secure another term in Tin Heng after losing to pro-democracy candidate Wong Pak-yu by 2,273 votes. FTU’s Alice Mak Mei-kuen, who has been a district councillor for more than two decades, and DAB’s Holden Chow Ho-ding were beaten by 1,714 and 1,430 votes respectively. The four who secured a second term by razor-thin margins were Starry Lee Wai-king and Wilson Or Chong-shing, both of DAB, FTU’s Aron Kwok Wai-keung and independent Paul Tse Wai-chun. The landslide results are set to drag the camp’s performance down in the next Legislative Council elections in 2020. Beijing must reassess Hong Kong as pro-democracy camp wins big, say analysts 25 Nov 2019 Beijing must reassess Hong Kong as pro-democracy camp wins big, say analysts 25 Nov 2019 Chow’s setback was particularly significant as he is one of five “super district councillors”, who are lawmakers returned from the district council constituency of the legislature. The defeat has disrupted his party’s plan in the next Legco election next year as Chow will no longer be able to run through the same constituency in 2020. DAB is now also limited to fielding one “super seat” candidate in the next election. 5. Next big prize: what impact will this have on the 2022 race to be Hong Kong leader? 5. Next big prize: what impact will this have on the 2022 race to be Hong Kong leader? The massive gains by the pan-democrats will translate most significantly in the choice of Hong Kong’s future leader. Since the pro-democracy side holds power in the overwhelming majority of district councils, it is set to enjoy a bigger say in the next chief executive election in three years. Sunday’s result means it will be able to obtain about 117 seats in the 1,200-strong Election Committee that selects the city’s leader. Now that they have control of the district councils, it would be a safe bet to say pan-democrats have those committee seats in the bag. This is not an insubstantial figure when added to the 325 other seats they typically control. It could make the pan-democrats the kingmakers in the next election for Hong Kong’s leader. 6. Fight or flight: what happens now to the protests? 6. Fight or flight: what happens now to the protests? The remarkable victory of the pro-democracy bloc begs a key question: will it heat up or defuse the months-long protests? The anti-government demonstrations have grown increasingly violent in recent weeks and have shown little sign of abating, although there was relative calm in the immediate run-up to the elections. No protests, violence or tear gas: peaceful Sunday as Hong Kong votes 25 Nov 2019 No protests, violence or tear gas: peaceful Sunday as Hong Kong votes 25 Nov 2019 Political scientist Dr Ma Ngok said the election results had definitely given the social movement a strong boost, especially on the international stage. He said the polls were considered abroad a “total electoral victory” in what was widely seen as a proxy referendum on the protests.   He also pointed out that polling day was peaceful, marking a stark difference to previous weekends, when violent clashes between protesters and police took hold of the city. “The government can no longer govern if it still refuses to listen to the people’s calls,” he said, warning it had already lost its legitimacy in both the district and legislative councils. Ma said the government had in the past always claimed its unpopular proposals had received the majority support from Hongkongers after securing the backing from the heads of the 18 district councils. That will no longer be available. Hong Kong protests: 10 top reads as city marks 5 months of unrest 10 Nov 2019 Hong Kong protests: 10 top reads as city marks 5 months of unrest 10 Nov 2019 On Reddit-like site LIHKG – the virtual command centre of the largely faceless protest movement – online users have been floating the idea of holding a massive march on Sunday. “We need to tell people that we are still unsatisfied [with the government’s response] and the district council polls are just one of our battlefields,” one wrote. Others also said that with the landslide victory, they should give the government an ultimatum and warned of escalating their actions on Sunday if their demands were not met by Saturday. 	SCMP

Some 81.3 cent of voters – 7,922 of 9,744 – had cast their ballots by the close of voting at 10.30pm. Civic Party leader Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu, who had been canvassing for Wong, said the turnout in City One was significant. “City One has been a stronghold of pan-democrats [in Legislative Council elections] but its voters have been represented by a pro-Beijing person on the district council for over 12 years,” Yeung said. “The government should pay extra attention as City One, being a typical middle-class district, reflects how the general middle class think.” Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted Former Civic Party member Ronny Tong Ka-wah, who quit the party and now sits on the Executive Council, contested the constituency in 2011 but was beaten by Wong by 1,478 votes.  Sunday’s elections are the first citywide polls since the unprecedented social unrest broke out in June – triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill – and are regarded by some as a de facto referendum on how the public views the government. Similar scenes also played out in Lai Chi Kok Central, a middle-class constituency which recorded the highest turnout in the city in 2015, with 65.3 per cent of votes cast. By 10.30pm, 81.9 per cent had voted in the race between pro-establishment candidate Bruce Li Ki-fung and Democratic Party member Ramon Yuen Hoi-man, who was seeking a second term.  More than 73 per cent of voters in Taikoo Shing West had also voted as of 9.30pm. The incumbent, the Democratic Party’s Andrew Chiu Ka-yin, who earlier had part of his ear bitten off during a confrontation between people of different political views, was running against pro-Beijing barrister Kacee Ting Wong. who earlier had part of his ear bitten off  Chinese University political scientist Dr Ma Ngok believed some middle-class voters, who generally only voted in Legislative Council elections, were now trying to make their voices heard through the district polls. Traditionally conservative constituencies in Kowloon East had been relatively quiet, Ma said. Meanwhile, voters were also out in force in several hotly contested constituencies which had caught public attention. One of them was South Horizons West, where Joshua Wong Chi-fung, the poster boy of the city’s pro-democracy movement, became the only candidate disqualified from the polls on the basis of his political stance. Joshua Wong only candidate disqualified The fiery battle between Kelvin Lam Ho-por, Wong’s backup candidate, and incumbent councillor Judy Chan Ka-pui drove up the turnout rate of the constituency to more than 79.8 per cent, almost 20 percentage points more than four years ago. Judy Chan Ka-pui Chan, protégé of New People’s Party chairwoman Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, was forced to make an emergency appeal to voters from 2pm, but stopped short of saying the high turnout lowered her chances. Regina Ip “The turnout this time is unprecedentedly high, though this constituency always saw higher-than-average turnouts in previous elections,” she said. “We are not sure who voters side with under such polarising social sentiments.” Lam also refrained from being optimistic: “Some flats here have been used as police quarters and so the atmosphere has been quite polarised. I hope more youngsters would come out and vote.” In Tuen Mun’s Lok Tsui constituency, where pro-establishment lawmaker Junius Ho Kwan-yiu – a hate figure for protesters – was seeking re-election, the turnout was 76.5 per cent by the close. He was running against Democrat Cary Lo Chun-yu and independent Chiang Ching-man. Junius Ho Over in Tsuen Wan’s Hoi Bun constituency, 79.5 per cent of voters had cast their ballot by the close in a race between 26-year old Occupy student leader Lester Shum, conservative incumbent Chow Ping-tim and Mok Yuen-kwan, of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong. The turnout was about double the 39 per cent in the previous poll. As of 9.30pm, Tsuen Wan had recorded the highest turnout rate of 71.5 per cent, followed by 71.2 per cent in Sha Tin. Islands district continued to have the lowest rate of 64.9 per cent while Wan Chai came the second last with 66.3 per cent. Ma said the turnout in Islands remained low because it was low density and had significant portions of rural areas, where the powerful Heung Yee Kuk was in control and people expected few surprises in elections.

But for real estate, the cities face different futures, according to the property arm of the world’s largest auction house. Prices in London, suppressed in part as the UK grapples with Brexit, will rebound quickly, said Dan Conn, chief executive of Christie’s International Real Estate. But improvement is far less certain in Hong Kong, after more than five months of violent protests, he said. The three-year fight over Brexit may be coming to a head with the December 12 general election. Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson is gambling an election will finally give him the numbers in parliament to push through Britain’s often-delayed divorce from the European Union. His rival, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, could put the whole thing to a second referendum, though he is trailing badly in polls. The EU has granted a three-month Brexit delay to January 31. Residential sales remain sluggish as Hong Kong homebuyers ‘stay on the sidelines’ 23 Nov 2019 Residential sales remain sluggish as Hong Kong homebuyers ‘stay on the sidelines’ 23 Nov 2019 Conn likes London because the UK market has been “hammered” for years, offering deals in what he calls a “great market”. Home prices in London’s most expensive districts have declined by 20.4 per cent since their peak in 2014, according to broker Savills. Brexit has also weighed on pricing, with values down 13.6 per cent since the referendum vote, the broker’s data show. “It’s depressed – it has the potential to come back relatively quickly,” Conn said in an interview in New York. “If you’re a buyer now, you can take advantage of the last four or five years that have been not so great.” But Johnson may impose a potential roadblock. His party said it plans to hit foreign buyers in England with a new tax intended to cool prices and help locals begin buying again.  In Hong Kong, the stand-off with pro-democracy protesters has continued to dampen investor confidence – with no immediate sign of resolution. Earlier this month, the city revised down its estimate for economic growth this year, with the government now forecasting the first annual contraction since the global financial crisis a decade ago. That makes any prediction for a rebound less certain.  “If you bought in Hong Kong two years ago, and you had to be a seller today, yeah, you probably have a little bit of indigestion,” he said.  In Asia, Conn likes Taiwan. It’s “now becoming a perceived relatively safe place to deploy capital because it has great infrastructure, and there’s a good concentration of wealth,” he said. Looking ahead, a broader economic downturn is another challenge for real estate globally. Conn does not anticipate a recession until the next US president is sworn in following the elections in November 2020. “If you looked at it in the ordinary course, my guess would be 2021 at the earliest, but probably not much later either,” he said. While interest rates are low, even lower ones would help, Conn says. He cannot remember a time when so many geopolitical factors – from trade wars, Hong Kong protests, Brexit, to state and local tax deductibility in the US – are lining up against property investors. “I’ve been surprised by the policies of the current administration because they don’t favour real estate in a lot of cases,” Conn said.

One avenue is to seriously consider options, such as holding an inquiry into all aspects of the fallout from the unrest, triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill. holding an inquiry into all aspects of the fallout from the unrest now-withdrawn extradition bill Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections He said both the pro-democracy and pro-establishment camps viewed this year’s district council elections as a political battle, not the usual contest over livelihood issues. His views were shared by City University political scientist Ray Yep Kin-man, who said the Beijing-friendly camp was expected to pay a heavy price for supporting the government to press ahead with the contentious extradition bill which could have led to fugitives being sent to mainland China, among other jurisdictions.  He said Beijing would have to decide whether to sack Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor. The stunning turnout and results showed the determination of Hong Kong people of different political persuasions to have their voice heard, he added. The citywide polls were widely viewed as a barometer of support for the protest movement and the government. The turnout not only surpassed that of the 2015 district council polls, but also that of 2003, when elections were held four months after a 500,000-strong march forced the government to withdraw a draft of national security legislation, commonly known as Article 23. Article 23  In the 2003 election, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) suffered a humiliating defeat, securing just 62 of the 206 seats it contested. The Democratic Party won 95 of the 120 seats it contested.    The DAB merged with the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance in 2005 to form Hong Kong’s largest pro-government party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong.  Cheung said while Beijing had emphasised the need to stop the violence in Hong Kong, it should now seize the opportunity to adjust its approach. Sensible Beijing officials should have a good grasp of public sentiment in Hong Kong after the election results Anthony Cheung, former secretary for transport and housing “I disagree with the notion that the central government is ready to see the demise of Hong Kong,” he said. “Sensible Beijing officials should have a good grasp of public sentiment in Hong Kong after the election results, while the central government should go beyond stopping violence through the action of Hong Kong police.” He believed Beijing would see the need to adjust its policies in the wake of Sunday’s election results, and appointing a commission of inquiry was a feasible option to address the demands of Hong Kong people. The city’s beleaguered government indicated earlier that it would consider setting up a commission of inquiry only if the public was dissatisfied with the report of the Independent Police Complaints Council, which is looking into the use of force by officers. What do Hong Kong’s extradition bill protesters really want? 13 Sep 2019 What do Hong Kong’s extradition bill protesters really want? 13 Sep 2019 At a meeting with 500 Beijing loyalists in Shenzhen in August, Zhang Xiaoming, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, left open the possibility of setting up a commission of inquiry after order was restored. Zhang Xiaoming Li Xiaobing, an expert on Beijing’s policies on Hong Kong at Nankai University in Tianjin, also agreed that the central government would need to adjust its assessment of the Hong Kong situation. “We had hoped for a shift in public opinion as the anti-government protests turned more violent, but it did not happen,” he said. “The central government needs to handle the situation in Hong Kong in a more pragmatic manner.” Li said Beijing needed to make more of an effort to win the support of Hong Kong people, but he did not think an independent inquiry was an effective way to defuse the crisis.

Online platforms popular among protesters, including the Telegram messaging app and online forum LIHKG, shared messages telling everyone eligible to vote not to use their smartphones, dress in black, or wear masks inside polling stations to make sure their votes are valid. Telegram messaging app online forum LIHKG Regular protester Kevin, 21, a student at the University of Hong Kong, cast his ballot and encouraged others to vote against pro-government candidates. “The only winning result, for me, will be when the government responds to our five demands,” he said, referring to protesters’ calls for universal suffrage and an inquiry into alleged police brutality, among others. “If we have more votes in the pro-democracy camp, we’ll have more legitimacy to fight on,” he said.  After more than five months of unrest, the past two weeks have seen clashes between police and students at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Polytechnic University. clashes between police and students at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Polytechnic University Most of about 1,000 masked radicals and their supporters who occupied PolyU and engaged in intense clashes with police a week ago are no longer on the campus, but the last few are still holding out, with police waiting for them to emerge. Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said last month that more than a third of those arrested at the time were under 18 years old, meaning they were not eligible to vote. As of last Monday, nearly 4,500 people were arrested in connection with the protests.  A 58-year-old retired logistics worker, identifying herself only as Chan, said she has attended nearly every weekend protest since early June but on Sunday, she was a volunteer for a pro-democracy candidate.  “The government has dismissed the legitimacy of protests, but if we are able to show them that we have legitimacy through votes, they cannot just ignore us,” she said.  Daniel Leung, 29, who works in marketing and voted in Tuen Mun, did not think that everyone who supported the protests ought to vote for pan-democrat candidates. “We have to respect those who are pro-protest but want to cast a blank vote because they are not happy with what the pan-democrats have been doing over recent years,” he said. Respecting one’s individual choice is the essence of democracy.” Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted Online platforms where protesters have been discussing their action plans were largely silent on their next moves, with no calls to carry out strikes or mass protests. A freelance tour guide who only gave his surname, Chan, said he sensed exhaustion among protesters. “No one knows what’s next yet. Over the past few days, most protesters have been focusing on asking people to vote,” he said.    Chan, who said he was a frequent protester and helped to gather donations and supplies for protests, felt the recent major clashes at Chinese University and Polytechnic University had affected many frontline protesters. “They are still digesting the intense happenings and need time to figure out their next step, as many are physically tired,” he said. But he was confident that the protests would not die down, even if it appeared that the protesters had no concrete plans. He said: “The collection of donations and materials has not stopped, the propaganda design teams have also been actively brainstorming. I believe things will be clearer after we know the election results.” For some pro-government voters living in areas where there have been regular protests, all they want is for the disruption to end. At a polling station in Yau Ma Tei, accountant Ho, 40, said she wanted her life to return to normal. “The MTR is still closing early, and my family has been staying at home a lot more on weekends,” she said. “I hope the protests die down soon and Hong Kong’s image can be saved internationally.” 	SCMP

The tsunami of disaffection among voters was clear across the board, as pan-democrats rode the wave to win big in poor and rich neighbourhoods, in both protest-prone and non-protest-afflicted districts and, in downtown areas as well as the suburbs. Less immediately obvious was whether there was a generational divide in the way people voted, but ousted pro-establishment district councillors suggested that young, first-time voters had been instrumental in dislodging them from their perch.    The final election results were confirmed at 1pm on Monday when the vote count was completed at Lam Tin constituency of Kwun Tong District Council. Among the 452 seats up for grabs, the pan-democrats were victorious in 347, the independents – many of them pro-democracy – won 45, while the pro-establishment camp had to make do with 60.  The pro-democracy camp now has control of 17 out of 18 district councils. It won all elected seats in Wong Tai Sin and Tai Po district councils. The only council held by the pro-establishment camp was the 18-member Islands district, where eight seats were handed out automatically to pro-establishment rural chiefs.  Before Sunday, all councils had been under pro-establishment control since the 2015 elections. Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections In a statement on Monday, city leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor promised to reflect on the voters’ message.  “There are various analyses and interpretations in the community in relation to the results, and quite a few are of the view that the results reflect people’s dissatisfaction with the current situation and the deep-seated problems in society,” the statement read. It added that the government would “listen to the opinions of members of the public humbly and seriously reflect”. Youthful, fresh-faced candidates, many active in the anti-government protests roiling the city over the past six months, were among prominent winners of the historic district council elections which had a record turnout of 2.94 million voters, representing 71.2 per cent of registered electors, up from the previous figure of 47 per cent in 2015. district council elections record turnout of 2.94 million voters Identity politics reigns over community issues in district elections: analysts 26 Nov 2019 Identity politics reigns over community issues in district elections: analysts 26 Nov 2019 In a stunning setback that could force an internal reshuffle, the city’s largest pro-establishment party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), which fielded 179 candidates, won only 21 seats. It had 119 before the election.

Lee fended off former lawmaker “Long Hair” Leung Kwok-hung of the pro-democracy camp. former lawmaker “Long Hair” The Democratic Party and the Civic Party, which won 91 and 32 seats respectively, have emerged as the two biggest parties on the city's district councils. DAB was relegated to the third largest party. The pro-Beijing Federation of Trade Unions and the Business and Professionals Alliance won five and three seats respectively. The dramatically changing colour of the 452-member district council map from the predominantly blue stronghold of the pro-Beijing ranks, which held 292 seats before the polls, to the pan-democratic camp’s yellow hue became clear early on as counting began when polls closed at 10.30pm. As it happened: election results live 25 Nov 2019 As it happened: election results live 25 Nov 2019 Since the pro-democracy bloc won majorities on nearly all district councils, it is likely to be awarded 117 seats on the election committee that selects the city’s chief executive. on the election committee that selects the city’s chief executive Although the district councils handle local matters and have no direct say over the chief executive’s programme, the elections were seen as a barometer of support either for the anti-government protest movement or for the embattled leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and her handling of the roiling unrest. elections were seen as a barometer of support With the thrashing suffered by the pro-Beijing camp, the government’s allies, it would appear Lam’s position was becoming increasingly untenable, even as she herself on Sunday tried to frame the elections as being about district-level matters. The major upsets of the night occurred barely an hour after counting began, with Junius Ho Kwan-yiu suffering the ignominy of being the first and highest-profile casualty of the anti-establishment backlash, soon followed by veteran lawmaker Michael Tien Puk-sun. Michael Tien Ho, who became a hate figure for the city’s pro-democracy movement after he was filmed shaking hands with men believed to have been involved in a vicious attack on protesters and passengers at Yuen Long MTR station on July 21, did not win any sympathy votes despite suffering a knife attack just three weeks before the elections. suffering a knife attack just three weeks before the elections Ho lost to democrat Cary Lo Chun-yu, who unseated him from his Lok Tsui constituency in Tuen Mun, winning 3,474 votes to Ho’s 2,278. The third candidate, Chiang Ching-man, got only 49 votes. In a Facebook post, Ho described his loss as “strange” and “regrettable”. He won more votes than at the last election, but not enough to keep his seat this time. “I’m moved, the opposition overwhelmed me with congratulations. It is not a bad thing to transform their brutality to harmony,” he wrote.    Lawmaker Tien lost his seat in Discovery Park, Tsuen Wan district, to pro-democracy candidate Lau Cheuk-yu. “I respect the electorate’s decision,” Tien said. The politician, known for his outspoken ways and dubbed the bad boy of the pro-Beijing camp, said he had the same number of votes as previously but suspected he lost out because of first-time voters. “If that’s true, it means young people are no longer insensitive to politics,” Tien said, adding the government would need to listen to the voice of young people. Other pro-establishment bigwigs were among the biggest losers. The DAB’s Holden Chow Ho-ding, Horace Cheung Kwok-kwan, Vincent Cheng Wing-shun and Edward Lau Kwok-fan were among those ousted. Cheung, a member of Lam’s executive council or team of advisers, said it was too early to draw any firm conclusions on the results. His party would hold a central committee meeting to discuss the election outcome. The losses sustained by the DAB were reminiscent of those it faced in 2003. Back then, only 62 out of 206 candidates won from the staunchly pro-Beijing party. That came after half a million people took to the streets to oppose the proposal to enact national security laws under Article 23 of the Basic Law. Article 23 of the Basic Law Back then, the devastating results prompted the resignation of party chairman Jasper Tsang Yok-sing. Any post mortem conducted by the party this time is likely to lead to a shake-up of its key leadership. Federation of Trade Unions’ legislators Alice Mak Mei-kuen and Ho Kai-ming were among other veterans booted out. Mak, who gained recent notoriety for uttering an expletive at Lam during a closed-door meeting over the decision to withdraw the extradition bill, blamed her loss on the administration. uttering an expletive at Lam during a closed-door meeting “The administration’s governance has given rise to so many public grievances. In the election campaign, pro-government candidates have been unfairly treated. This is a very important reason,” Mak said. She said she had been serving her constituents diligently for more than a quarter of a century but, in a divided society, “it’s not about our work, it’s about our political stance”. Among the young winners, at least five activists from the Occupy movement of 2014, which opposed Beijing’s electoral reforms, won seats, nudging out veterans. Occupy movement of 2014 Occupy student activist Lester Shum, who ousted Chow Ping-tim in the Tsuen Wan constituency of Hoi Bun, was emotional in victory. “The government must respond to our five demands as soon as possible,” he said. “We can be happy for tonight and take a rest tomorrow, but we will need to keep up our fight the day after for the future of Hong Kong.” Lester Shum Political crisis makes Hongkongers abroad come home to vote 25 Nov 2019 Political crisis makes Hongkongers abroad come home to vote 25 Nov 2019 The five demands have been the clarion call of protesters during the past six months of demonstrations, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, which has since morphed into a full-blown anti-government movement that has resulted in increasingly violent clashes with police. The five demands Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University The five demands are for the withdrawal of the bill, an agreement not to call the clashes of June 12 a riot, amnesty for those arrested on that day, a commission of inquiry into allegations of excessive use of force by the police and a push for genuine universal suffrage. All five Occupy activists were prime movers of the peaceful protests over the past months. Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, the convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, the organiser of the mass marches of the movement, was also among those elected. Sham, who was still wearing crutches and recovering from an attack by hammer-wielding thugs, called on Lam to listen to the people’s voice and address the demands. an attack by hammer-wielding thugs “I hoped the pro-democracy bloc could win more than half of the seats in district council elections,” Sham said. He hoped the pan-democrats would try their best to carry out their duties to prove that “supporters of democracy are more outstanding than those who support the establishment”. Another key winner was Kelvin Lam, 40, who replaced Occupy student leader Joshua Wong Chi-fung on the ticket after the latter was banned from running because of his stance on self-determination. Lam beat incumbent Judy Chan Ka-pui of the New People’s Party by 4,100 votes to 3,100 in the South Horizons West constituency, Southern district. Kelvin Lam Joshua Wong Judy Chan Ka-pui of the New People’s Party “The high turnout rate did benefit the pro-democracy camp,” Kelvin Lam said. “The result is like a referendum of the current administration, like a confidence vote.” As of just before 11am, the Hang Seng Index had shot up 1.7 per cent to 27,045. Analysts said the rally came on hopes that the election results would mean the recent violent protests subside. Hong Kong minister admits ‘relatively low’ trust in government 25 Nov 2019 Hong Kong minister admits ‘relatively low’ trust in government 25 Nov 2019 With pan-democrats set to ride the new momentum, their challenge will be to harness their new-found power at the district council level. If before the government could rely on the pro-establishment controlled district councils to rubber-stamp its measures on municipal affairs, it is all but certain there will now be gridlock, with both sides set to clash on decision-making.   One key challenge for the democrats will be to force concessions out of Lam and her government, especially on resolving the current political impasse over the protesters’ demands. Lam had insisted she would not address any of their demands unless the city returned to calm and order, after increasingly radical acts by demonstrators who have attacked metro stations and shops linked to mainland China, disrupted traffic and barricaded roads. shops linked to mainland China More than 5,000 people have been arrested since the protests began in early June and radicals have become increasingly violent in their clashes with police. On Sunday, anything but black appeared to be the new black, as protesters studiously avoided wearing the colour, as agreed on their Telegram channels. As result announcements rolled into the early hours of Monday, on LIHKG, protesters’ Reddit-like virtual command centre, there was much celebration but also reflection on next steps. The victory was but a small milestone, said some, with more yet to be achieved in their pursuit of democracy. 	SCMP

But this election was a global event as almost 3 million residents clamoured to be heard	Nearly 3 million Hongkongers voted in Sunday’s district council elections, the record-breaking turnout sending a peaceful but powerful signal of their demand for a say in the politics of their protest-rocked city. Voter turnout was confirmed at 71.2 per cent of 4.1 million registered to vote, compared with 47 per cent in the 2015 polls, and far surpassed the record of 58 per cent set in 2016’s Legislative Council elections, where at least 10 localist candidates were elected. Ballots were being counted as soon as polling ended at 10.30pm, with final results expected in the early hours of Monday, although disputes could delay the outcomes in several keenly fought districts. But all indications were that there would be a significant shift away from the pro-establishment camp that had dominated the district council landscape for years. Shortly before 1am, it was announced that the overall turnout was 2.94 million. Signs of a struggle to retain their vote share emerged as early as 11am when candidates in the camp often dubbed as pro-Beijing and allies of the government began issuing emergency calls for votes to boost their chances.    LATEST: Pro-Beijing camp left reeling from landslide defeat in Hong Kong elections 25 Nov 2019 LATEST: Pro-Beijing camp left reeling from landslide defeat in Hong Kong elections 25 Nov 2019 There were also predictions that several high-profile lawmakers, double-hatting as district councillors and in marginal seats, could be dislodged from their council perch. As rumours spread over the weekend that election officials would use a ruse to end voting prematurely, calls grew online for early and orderly voting, mobilising thousands to descend onto the more than 600 polling stations across the city and the outlying islands. Queues began forming as early as 6.30am, and a significant number of overseas Hongkongers and those in mainland China made the trek home to cast their ballots.  In Tai Kok Tsui, Evan Wong Leung-fung, 23, was among the first to vote. “I woke up so early to discharge my duty as a Hong Kong citizen and I chose to come to the polling station because of the rumours,” he said. “Although the government has made a clarification, I still played safe.” Constitutional and mainland affairs minister Patrick Nip Tak-kuen acknowledged the rumours that trust in the government was low, an admission of the disconnect between the administration and citizens over the past six months of the unrest. Taking place amid the protest crisis and worsening violence, which culminated in a siege at Polytechnic University last weekend, the elections attracted the global media’s attention. Many led their bulletins on the polls, never mind that these are for the lowest tier of administration in the city.  The traditionally uneventful ballot for 452 seats in the city’s 18 district councils, which decide on municipal minutiae such as the location of bus stops, car parks and other amenities, had taken on a disproportionate significance in a city deeply divided by the increasingly violent protests. Analysts said a strong showing by the opposition pan-democrats would indicate that Hongkongers still backed the protesters, despite a growing proclivity towards violence by some. There was little desire among them to got zek – a favourite Cantonese phrase literally meaning to cut the mat – or cut ties with the protesters even as the radical core had disrupted the lives of many with their mayhem and dented the city’s economy and international standing. got zek  A clear message could be that voters were rejecting embattled leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s leadership and her handling of the crisis, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, which has roiled the city for nearly six months. On the other hand, if the pan-democrats did not make dramatic headway and the pro-establishment camp retained its hold on the ground, more conservative voters could be sending a signal that they were tired of the violence and desired a return to normalcy. Either way, the record turnout would be seen as a signal from voters to have their say in politics, said analysts, who also suggested that the need to reopen discussion on political reform could not be deferred for much longer without fuelling people’s frustrations. Hong Kong aborted plans to have direct elections for the city’s chief executive as the Legislative Council in 2015 rejected a framework set by Beijing in which candidates had to be pre-vetted. For now, the more direct impact of the district council elections will be on the 117 seats they would occupy in the nearly 1,200-member Election Committee that selects the chief executive. Currently in the district councils, pro-establishment councillors hold 292 seats while pan-democrats have 116 seats and independents hold 23. More than 5,000 people have been arrested since the protests began in early June, and the demonstrations have morphed into an anti-government movement focusing on allegations of police brutality and a desire for universal suffrage. The two are among the five demands of protesters; the others are the withdrawal of the bill; a rejection of calling the clashes of June 12 a riot; and amnesty for those arrested then. On Sunday, anything but black appeared to be the new black, as protesters studiously avoided wearing the colour, as agreed on their telegram channels. Radical and peaceful protesters blended in as one throughout the day in the autumn sunshine, joining snaking queues that coiled around housing blocks and neighbourhood markets and parks. While black-clad protesters were nowhere to be seen, riot police in full gear were seen keeping an eye outside polling stations, studiously low-key, but their presence was hard to miss. Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted Student Sunny Chua, who turned 18 in May, joined the long queue outside the Kam Ping polling station in North Point in the evening to cast his first-ever ballot. “Our society is at a critical moment, and a lot has happened in my university too. I hope to use my own small effort to help elect a councillor who has the correct political attitude,” said the accounting major freshman at Baptist University. Chua said that for him and many young people, a candidate’s political stance – rather than community benefits and services a councillor could promise – was the most important factor in making a choice. At the polling station at Sung Tak Wong Kin Sheung Memorial School in Tai Po, Mr Tong, a 25-year-old civil servant, said the months-long protests had had a positive effect, given the high turnout. “They’ve reminded us of our rights as citizens in Hong Kong, and shown us that we should choose our candidates wisely,” he said, declining to reveal whom he voted for. A retiree surnamed Law, 75, who lives on Nathan Road, the main traffic artery in Kowloon, which has been a main protest flashpoint over the past six months, said he was not opting for a “pro-protester” candidate. “I am very scared of these young people who are creating trouble every day right below my home,” he said. “It has got really noisy and it makes me afraid to go out. They have not experienced poverty and a troubled society so they do not understand how important it is for Hong Kong to continue to prosper.” Among those out in force to canvass for votes was activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung, the only aspirant banned from running. “Even if they censor me out from the ballot, lock me in prison, it will just encourage me to continue to fight for the future with even stronger determination,” he told reporters. After voting early at Raimondi College on Robinson Road, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said many Hongkongers hoped the calm in the city over the last few days could continue after the polls. “I hope it means everyone does not want such chaos in Hong Kong, and we can leave these difficult times so that we can start afresh,” she said. Asked whether she would view the results as a vote of confidence in her, Lam replied: “Today’s vote is for registered voters to select their preferred candidates to represent their district’s interests in the 18 district councils. I’m sure each registered voter will take into account all factors in deciding their choices.” Voting proceeded without incident, but there were unverified reports of the elderly being bused in to vote at a few polling stations and others receiving free gifts before they cast their ballot. In South Horizons West constituency, incumbent Judy Chan Ka-pui, of the New People’s Party, faced a challenge from Kelvin Lam Ho-por, regarded as a “plan B” candidate after Joshua Wong was disqualified. Chan said it was difficult to assess her chances. “The turnout is unprecedentedly high, though this constituency saw higher than average turnouts in previous elections,” Chan said. “We are not sure who they are siding with under such polarised social sentiment.” Kelvin Lam also said the high turnout did not mean he could be optimistic. “Some flats here are used as police quarters, and that’s why the atmosphere is quite polarised,” he said. “I hope more youngsters come out and vote.” In To Kwa Wan North, lawmaker Starry Lee Wai-king, who leads the largest pro-establishment party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, said: “We know this time there are a lot of people showing up to vote. We urge our supporters to come out, if you want to restore peace and order in our society.” Lee, whose opponent was “Long hair” Leung Kwok-hung, added that she had never seen such high turnout for a district council election, and therefore results were hard to predict. Kwong Po-yin, a doctor who gained her district council seat after the Occupy protests in 2014 as a localist, was seeking re-election in the Whampoa West constituency, Kowloon City district. She said voting showed Hongkongers’ spirit of not giving up. “This is the first election since the protests. We’ve already lost a lot of comrades in the demonstrations, we hope to win this time,” she said. “Our society needs to be rebuilt, and we hope to see people still have hope in our own community.” Among the 1,090 candidates, 19 incumbent lawmakers were seeking re-election as district councillors. Some marginal seats could switch sides. Five of the lawmakers, including DAB’s Holden Chow Ho-ding and Horace Cheung Kwok-kwan, garnered less than 55 per cent in their respective constituencies in the 2015 polls. Pan-democrats such as Democratic Party’s Ted Hui Chi-fung and James To Kun-sun also won by small margins in the previous election. Ray Yep Kin-man, a professor at City University’s department of public policy, said: “Given the historic turnout rate for the district council elections, I think the pro-establishment camp will pay a heavy price for supporting the government in pressing ahead with the extradition bill [before it was withdrawn], and how it has handled the months of protests. “Beijing needs to ponder whether it should bring forward the plan to sack Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor as chief executive.” Meanwhile, at ground zero of the protest movement over the past week, Polytechnic University, which had been besieged by police since last Sunday after extremely violent clashes with protesters, more diehard demonstrators walked out, suffering from mental and physical fatigue. But two protesters still holed up lobbed another charge at police: they said the siege was depriving them of their right to vote.

But more than five months of turmoil in the city, which saw anti-government protests becoming increasingly violent and spreading from the streets to university campuses, made her decide it was time to vote. anti-government protests Leung, who was with her daughters, aged 18 and 20, said she was angry with the way police had dealt with the protesters. Over at a polling station in Mong Kok, the queue was about 500 deep at noon. May Ho, 61, said she was there to support pro-Beijing candidate Keith Lee Ka-hin, because she felt he stood against violence. May Ho, 61, said she was there to support pro-Beijing candidate Keith Lee Ka-hin, because she felt he stood against violence. “My mother, 91, is also coming out to vote after 20 years,” she said. “Society needs to return to peace.” A surreal calm descended on Hong Kong on Sunday as voters appeared in record numbers from early morning to choose 452 representatives for 18 district councils. district councils  In sharp contrast to so many Sundays over the past months, there were no protests, no clashes between masked radicals and police, no violence, vandalism or tear gas. From Causeway Bay to Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok, Hongkongers went about their usual Sunday activities, with no hint that these very areas have been regular flashpoints in the unending turmoil.  It was calm even at Polytechnic University in Hung Hom, where some of the most violent scenes played out only last Sunday as a mob rained petrol bombs onto police and set an armoured vehicle ablaze. Out of about 1,000 radical protesters and their supporters, only a few diehards are still holding out on the campus, as police wait for them to emerge.  On Sunday, Hong Kong paused to let elections for its 18 district councils proceed peacefully. The councils are mostly advisory, deal with municipal matters and have little power. In the 2015 elections, pro-establishment candidates took control of all 18 councils. This year, for the first time, all 452 seats were contested, attracting 1,090 candidates. There were 4.1 million registered voters, a million more than four years ago. This year’s election was being watched closely by many as a referendum of sorts on Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and her administration for their handling of the unrest. Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor An increase in violence in the recent weeks, including attacks on some candidates, led to talk that the elections might be postponed. But it went ahead as planned, without a heavy police presence, and no violence was reported. All day on Sunday, both the pro-establishment and pro-democracy camps appealed to their supporters to come out and vote. With news that large numbers of opposition supporters had joined polling queues from early morning, pro-establishment lawmaker Horace Cheung Kwok-kwan of the Democratic Alliance for Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong began issuing “urgent” pleas to his supporters. Competing for a seat in the Central and Western district council, he hoped pro-establishment voters could still prevail if more of them showed up. “The traditional wisdom is that a high turnout means the pan-democracy camp can have the upper hand,” he said. “But what if it is a super high turnout?” District council elections close in Hong Kong with record turnout 25 Nov 2019 District council elections close in Hong Kong with record turnout 25 Nov 2019 Civil Human Rights Front convenor Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, a pro-democracy candidate who was assaulted by a group of assailants during the campaign, said: “For the past few months, some people may not have been able express themselves at the protests, and this is a chance for them to speak out. “The government should have listened to the people when millions took to the street in June and July. The people of Hong Kong have been very tolerant of the government.” He said the election would “give our judgment on what has happened”. Pro-Beijing politician Junius Ho Kwan-yiu, who was injured in a knife attack while campaigning for a seat in the Tuen Mun district council, was seen moving about with a group of bodyguards on Sunday. “I’ve hired bodyguards, but that does not mean I feel unsafe,” he said. “I cannot afford to get injured again. I want to serve Hong Kong people.” By late afternoon, it was clear that voters had made history. The percentage of those who cast their votes overtook the 2015 figure, before surpassing the record for the 2016 Legislative Council elections. Accountant Franky Kwok, in his late 30s, flew home from Beijing, where he works, to cast his vote and help determine the path forward for Hong Kong. He was against the violence that has been rife for so long. Explaining why he came back, he said: “It is to refuse to be muted by the black terror, say no to rioters and the pseudo democrats. Hong Kong is my home. It used to be a peaceful place and everyone respected law and order. I want the original Hong Kong back.” At the opposite end of the political spectrum was first-time voter and PolyU student Ken Au, 19, who said he had been feeling “helpless and pessimistic” about the anti-government movement recently. “I want to vote the pro-establishment camp out of the system,” he said.    While voting proceeded smoothly on the whole, it was not without some confusion. In Sha Tin, a 63-year-old woman who gave her name as Ng, said she was shocked when she arrived at the polling station at 9am and an election officer told her that her name was already crossed out from the electoral register. That meant either that she had already voted, or someone else used her particulars to vote. “The polling officer asked if I wanted to vote for a second time, but I told him how is that possible? He also asked if I lost my ID card recently. I said I didn’t, I just got my new ID card in October after the government told me to renew it,” she said. “The officer said he could let me vote again, but my ballot would be invalid. So I said, ‘What’s the point?’” Ng did not vote, but filed a complaint. She said the officer later explained that it was possible that a polling officer had wrongly crossed out her name when someone else turned up to vote. Meanwhile, voters from Pok Fu Lam constituency in Southern district complained of inconvenience as their polling station near the University of Hong Kong was moved for security reasons after recent clashes near the campus. They had to travel to another polling station at a sports centre in Aberdeen, about five kilometres away.

At a polling station in Kowloon Tong, Henry Tang Ying-yen, a standing committee member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said he was pleased by the big turnout as it showed Hongkongers’ view of democracy. He added: “The background of this election is special, as it is taking place after several months of social unrest. I think many Hong Kong people would like violence and chaos to stop, so that public order can be restored, and we can start to reconcile and rebuild.” 	SCMP

At polling stations across Hong Kong, some voters said they had come back from as far as Britain to do their part in selecting 452 representatives for the city’s 18 district councils. Many said the drawn-out political crisis sparked by the government’s failed extradition bill was the reason they decided to come home and vote. political crisis extradition bill Peter Chan Ka-hung, a 28-year-old epidemiologist living in the English city of Oxford came back to vote in Wong Tai Sin district. He said the ongoing protests “revealed some long-standing structural problems of the current government and society” and wanted to do his part for the city by voting.  “Although this election won’t solve many of these problems, I believe it will be a good start to improve the situation bit by bit, and to build a momentum for future social movements,” Chan said. Three others said they came back from Singapore. Warren Chau, 31, who has been working there in IT for six years, said he booked his tickets home three months ago.  “In Singapore, we cannot discuss politics openly, so my friends and I have suppressed our feelings over the situation in Hong Kong for the past few months,” Chau said.  He said he was particularly frustrated by the lack of response from the government over the protesters’ key demands. “The election is a legitimate way to express our voices and tell the government what we want and who we support,” he said. Sonia Lau, 32, who works in a Singapore university, said she had never voted before, but felt compelled to do so this year after watching the protests unfold.  “I used to feel my vote was useless, and one vote did not make much of a difference. Now I feel we need to do whatever we can to make a change,” Lau said. Another voter who returned from Singapore, and asked to be identified only as Li, said she felt sad and angry watching the situation in Hong Kong deteriorate. “I feel the government has basically disrespected the demands of the people, resulting in multiple injuries at protests. I wanted to show my dissatisfaction,” said Li, in her 20s, who has been living in Singapore for two years working in the IT sector.

In deciding whom to vote for, he looked mainly at the candidate’s position on the government’s handling of the unrest, now in its sixth month. Among immigrants voting for the first time was a 30-year-old art industry worker, who asked to be identified only by her surname, Chen. Voting in the Belcher constituency of Central and Western District, she moved to Hong Kong from mainland China with her family in 2002. Referring to the aftermath of the 2014 protests which shut down parts of Hong Kong for 79 days, she said: “The city’s legal system has been under threat after the Occupy Central protests, as we’ve seen Legislative Council candidates being disqualified one after another. Record turnout for Hong Kong poll – and people are still voting 25 Nov 2019 Record turnout for Hong Kong poll – and people are still voting 25 Nov 2019 “As Hong Kong people still have faith in the electoral process, I want to make my contribution by using my vote to kick the pro-establishment camp out of the district council.” But a 50-year-old entrepreneur from France, identifying himself as Jacques, decried the ongoing protests. Voting in Central and Western District, he said: “I hate violence. This movement is not about democracy, it’s about separation from China. I think it’s dishonest to say you want democracy and then beat people up. Not enough people are denouncing violence.”    As of 8.30pm on Sunday, nearly 2.7 million people, or 66.5 per cent of all registered voters, have cast their votes. The turnout has been the biggest in Hong Kong’s history, for any kind of election. The previous record was 2.2 million people voting in the 2016 Legislative Council elections. He Wen, a Hong Kong affairs expert at the Shanghai Institute for East-Asia Studies, said he was not surprised to see people returning from overseas to vote, given that there were contests for all district council seats this year. He said: “I expect the pro-establishment camp to lose some seats. But the question is, how many seats will they lose?” City University political scientist James Sung Lap-kung said while the number of voters returning from overseas might not be large, they were showing solidarity with the protesters. “I guess these Hongkongers are returning to vote mostly in support of the protesters,” Sung said. “It can be seen as a boost and support for the younger generation.” 	SCMP

As city residents headed to the polls in record numbers, widely shared social media messages reported several unsubstantiated potential threats, from early closures of polling stations to Facebook harvesting voting data. The polls, to choose 452 local councillors, were some of the most closely watched district-level elections since the city returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The results will be seen as a barometer of support for the anti-government protest movement now roiling the city, and could exert more pressure on embattled leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to find new ways to resolve the impasse. After voting at Sha Tin Government Secondary School on Sunday, Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Patrick Nip Tak-kuen was asked why many voters apparently feared polling stations would close early. He replied: “The people’s level of trust in the government has been relatively low ... but as I have said, the voting time is from 7.30am to 10.30pm, and votes will only be counted after this process has finished.” He said the government was “aware of many rumours and unfounded information circulating online”.  “We are proactively clarifying them and hope to bring the general public timely and accurate information,” he added. Among the misinformation that officials debunked was the claim that elderly or disabled people did not need to queue at polling stations, an idea shared widely online. Early voting surge amid rumours polls to shut prematurely due to disruption 24 Nov 2019 Early voting surge amid rumours polls to shut prematurely due to disruption 24 Nov 2019 The government clarified in a post on the District Council Election Facebook page that this claim was not true. The post explained that after voters queued to enter a polling station, they were usually asked to queue again to collect their ballot paper, lining up according to the first letter of their ID card number.  Some elderly people could have been asked to jump the first queue because no one else with their ID card letter was waiting in the second queue, it said.  “Polling station staff were only handling the situation flexibly,” the post read, adding that there were special arrangements for disabled people or voters in wheelchairs. Electoral authorities have been dismissing various rumours since earlier this week. Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted Hong Kong elections: voting kicks off in first polls since protest crisis erupted On Friday, messages circulated online calling on people to vote early amid rumours that “emergency situations” could force polling stations to close as early as 10.30am, with a final count of the ballots then taken. But the Registration and Electoral Office (REO) issued a swift clarification that, in the event of an emergency, voting at specific polling stations would either ­resume within 90 minutes of the disruption or be postponed until December 1. The REO also issued a statement on Saturday after rumours emerged suggesting that facial recognition systems were being installed in polling stations. The ballot is secret. There is no ‘facial recognition system’ installed in any polling station of the 2019 District Council Ordinary Election Registration and Electoral Office “The ballot is secret. There is no ‘facial recognition system’ installed in any polling station of the 2019 District Council Ordinary Election,” the statement read. However, there was no clarification on another online theory. Some internet users were wary of Facebook’s election-day feature, which asked people if they had voted. A warning was being circulated, which read: “Facebook has records of the pages you browsed, and the comments you made. If you clicked ‘Yes, I voted’, it can guess which camp you voted for instantly. This would be way more accurate than exit polls.” It was unclear why the users thought Facebook having such intelligence would be undesirable. The Post has reached out to Facebook for comment.

The duo urged police to end their siege and for Polytechnic University to take more steps to help the estimated 30 people still remaining on campus, many of whom they said were showing mental health problems and an inability to speak. At least five left the campus on Sunday and into the early hours of Monday. Some of those still inside had reportedly resorted to self-harm. “They are starting to feel reluctant to see others,” a 20-year-old in a mask who identified himself as Ah Cheung said, confirming previous accounts by legislators, lawyers and social workers. “Despite their poor health, they refuse to eat. Sometimes, they can’t even say a complete sentence.”  Cheung has not left the campus since November 17, the day police surrounded the institution and barred any frontline radicals from leaving after one of the most intense and fiery battles in more than five months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong. The demonstrations were triggered by opposition to a shelved extradition bill that would have allowed the transfer of suspects to mainland China. It meant Cheung, and many others, were unable to cast their votes during Sunday’s district council elections, which had attracted a record turnout for any poll in Hong Kong’s history with five hours still to go before the polls closed.  “For the dozens of us remaining here, we want to go out there and vote,” Cheung said. Campus violence a blow to Hong Kong universities’ image and appeal 23 Nov 2019 Campus violence a blow to Hong Kong universities’ image and appeal 23 Nov 2019 Police had forbidden anyone over 18 years of age to leave without facing arrest for suspected rioting offences, a move Cheung and those who remained regarded as an abuse of process. For those under the age of 18, they could leave after having their details taken, although police reserved the right to take follow-up action.   A student who appeared alongside Cheung and who gave his name only as Ron, said the district council elections on Sunday were important. It was a de facto referendum to gauge public sentiment after months of protests that had divided the city into a pro-democracy bloc that wants to hold the authorities accountable and government supporters who would prefer the city to return to peace, he said. Inside the besieged Hong Kong Polytechnic University Inside the besieged Hong Kong Polytechnic University Inside the besieged Hong Kong Polytechnic University “We are angry and frustrated,” Cheung said. The two also revealed more details about the increasing cabin fever being felt by those still on campus. They said many protesters had become reclusive and urged police to stop their “illegal detention” immediately, calling the situation “an international humanitarian crisis”. A police spokesman said they had insisted on “flexibility” and a “peaceful solution”. They urged “rioters … to leave in a peaceful manner”. The police siege followed tense clashes between protesters and police earlier that week at the Chinese University in Sha Tin. The incidents turned universities into protester strongholds, with stockpiles of petrol bombs and their own kitchens, a change of tack from cat-and-mouse clashes on major roads and in shopping malls. On Sunday, a team of two clinical psychologists from Hong Kong Red Cross took to the campus to provide support, alongside principal law lecturer Eric Cheung Tat-ming of the University of Hong Kong, barrister Linda Wong Shun-hung and Teddy Tang Chun-keung, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of the Heads of Secondary Schools. Businessman ‘Dream Bear’ Lew Mon-hung loses final appeal 10 May 2019 Businessman ‘Dream Bear’ Lew Mon-hung loses final appeal 10 May 2019 At least five left the campus on Sunday and early into Monday, with some taken away by police and others requiring immediate hospital treatment, including one brought out on a stretcher by paramedics. A 20-year-old student who surrendered walked out with controversial businessman Lew Mon-hung, a former member of China’s top political advisory body, shortly after midnight on Sunday. Lew, commonly referred to by his nickname “Dream Bear”, said he entered the campus as “a concerned citizen” after securing police approval. He said he was with a team, including first aid workers, looking for people to bring out, but they could only locate the third-year student. The student was “distressed and muddled” and seemed to be a “lone wolf” who avoided others, said Lew, adding that might have worsened his emotional condition.   “He was neither confrontational nor did he have a mindset of perishing together,” Lew, once an ally of ex-Hong Kong leader Leung Chun-ying before the two fell out, said. “But he seemed to be extremely exhausted [when we found him].” A tour around the campus by Post reporters on Sunday revealed an empty site with protesters barely visible, with food supplies, including biscuits, cup noodles and energy bars, still available. Post Tents, mats and pillows were seen in some rooms. At least three more left the campus overnight on Sunday. At 11.30pm, a 23-year-old male protester agreed to end his stay on campus after many hours of encouragement from social workers and church-goers. A teacher from PolyU said it took days of befriending him before he yielded.

At about 3am on Monday, two more male protesters left the campus following a lengthy campaign of persuasion by a group of volunteers, who had earned their trust over the past few days. They came to encourage protesters to leave, especially those who had appeared self-destructive. The pair were then taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital with their personal data recorded by police without being arrested immediately.

Chow Pak-kwan, joined by his father and lawyer, on Saturday made his first public appearance since being discharged from hospital. He was dressed in black and spoke in a low and hoarse voice, apparently still recovering. “I found that most ridiculous when [the officer] pulled out his gun,” Chow said. “As one can see from the footage, there is no one on the road, no one else is trying to threaten him.” Chow was shot by a traffic officer surnamed Kwan during a citywide strike on November 11. Footage showed Kwan first grappling with another protester before drawing his revolver and pressing it against the other man’s chest, as Chow approached. He then fired at Chow.  Police said the shooting did not deviate from guidelines on the use of firearms. The force also said Kwan was facing a group that was targeting his pistol. Since the incident, Kwan has been on leave having also suffered injuries during the incident.  A defiant Chow, a Vocational Training Council student, said he had no regrets about being at the scene, although he felt blessed he survived the shooting and would never forget the episode.  “Minutes after being shot, I wondered whether I would die from the incident, but I believed I must live on.

V for Vendetta Chow did not offer his account on the motive or details of the incident in Sai Wan Ho, citing a potential legal proceeding. After being shot, and following an attempt to flee the scene in vain, Chow was taken to hospital where he stayed until last Wednesday. One of his kidneys and part of his liver were removed during an operation. He is now on bail after being arrested for unlawful assembly in Sai Wan Ho. No formal charge had been brought against Chow by Saturday, according to his lawyer and former lawmaker Andrew Cheng Kar-foo, nor had police requested Chow to make any statement yet with his legal team planning to do so after his condition improved. “Whatever charges police may bring, we will fight to the end,” Cheng said. “That’s the instruction of our client for now that he will contest against the offence even if he is only accused of unlawful assembly.” Chow is still slowly recovering from the shooting. He still has pain on his waist and has to use a walking stick. Despite his injury, he said he would vote in the district council elections on Sunday. 	SCMP

After nearly six months of unrelenting conflict, the elections – which are for the lowest tier of the administration – are seen as a barometer of support for the anti-government protest movement and de facto referendum on Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and her team. While district councils have been heavily dominated by her allies in the pro-Beijing camp, expectations are high that voters could side with more pan-democrats this time and send Lam a clear signal of how they view her government. As Hong Kong enjoyed a rare respite from chaotic protests for the fourth day in a row on Saturday, young voters were mobilising online, urging their peers to vote in the morning, rather than wait until later in the day as in previous elections. Some 1,090 candidates will contest in 452 constituencies, the first time that all seats are up for grabs. More than 600 polling stations, under the watch of riot police for the first time in the polls’ history, will be opened on Sunday from 7.30am to 10.30pm. under the watch of riot police Hong Kong’s local elections on schedule despite anti-government protests Hong Kong’s local elections on schedule despite anti-government protests Hong Kong’s local elections on schedule despite anti-government protests On Saturday, candidates were spotted making last-ditch efforts to canvass votes citywide, while black-clad protesters were nowhere in sight, except for the diehard dozens refusing to leave the besieged Polytechnic University. besieged Polytechnic University  The university, next to the critical Cross-Harbour Tunnel now shut for 11 days, was surrounded by police last Sunday after a day of fierce clashes with protesters occupying the campus.

If a lot of voters are using their ballot to voice their discontent, Lam needs to think of how to respond to that Edmund Cheng, political scientist Cheng added that he believed an independent commission of inquiry remained a mainstream demand among Hong Kong people.  Hours earlier, on a radio programme, former transport and housing minister Anthony Cheung Bing-leung urged residents to come out and cast their votes, as it would help push the government to solve the current impasse that had gripped the city since June. Both sides wary in Hong Kong’s unpredictable district council elections 23 Nov 2019 Both sides wary in Hong Kong’s unpredictable district council elections 23 Nov 2019 Cheung, now a professor of public administration at Education University, said the election was “a good opportunity for the government and society to know how voters perceived the situation”. “Even without people voting, we already know why social conflicts have emerged ... But voting is better than conducting a public opinion poll, which could be restrained by the sampling size,” he said. Voting is better than conducting a public opinion poll, which could be restrained by the sampling size Anthony Cheung, former official “This election will be an expression of political views ... The results will be a significant and valuable reference point for the government.” Cheung noted pro-democracy candidates had called for people to vote for them to show that they wanted the government to accept protesters’ demands. The pro-establishment camp, meanwhile, said voters should support pro-Beijing hopefuls if they wanted the violence to stop, he added. The former official believed authorities did not expect the pro-government camp to do well. “The government would feel pressured by the results,” he said. “Beijing and the city’s government would also be prepared for results that are unfavourable to them.” Chief Secretary Cheung said the government was determined to hold an “orderly, peaceful, fair and honest” election on Sunday. “It’s a very important election because it’s the first time that every single seat is contested. It’s a real democratic exercise,” he said. It’s a very important election because it’s the first time that every single seat is contested.

The polls, held in the midst of a crisis now into its sixth month, will have knock-on effects on the Legislative Council elections next year which draw candidates from among successful district councillors.

Presiding officers’ honorarium increased ahead of district council polls 21 Nov 2019 Presiding officers’ honorarium increased ahead of district council polls 21 Nov 2019 In 2015, the turnout rate for the district council polls reached a record 47 per cent. All eyes will now be not just on turnout but on some high-profile candidates. Among them, Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front which organised the key mass rallies of the past months, said the polls were about making a choice for the city’s future. “For the pro-democracy camp, it’s about striving for the five demands and a democratic system. For the pro-establishment bloc, they may want to show support for Carrie Lam and police,” he said. “It’s a choice for our future, and we’ll tell the world of our choice. Carrie Lam must respect that.” It’s a choice for our future, and we’ll tell the world of our choice. Carrie Lam must respect that Jimmy Sham, candidate Sham was physically attacked in the lead-up to the polls. He is running in Sha Tin against incumbent Wong Yue-hon. In Western district, pro-democracy candidate Jordan Pang Ka-Ho said he spent the whole day giving out pamphlets. “I don’t think the result will put pressure on the government, as it hasn’t been listening to the people,” Pang said. “The elections also cannot do justice to our comrades arrested in the protests, but it is a good way to show voters’ discontent towards the establishment.” Hong Kong police to draft in 200 special officers as protests roll on 23 Nov 2019 Hong Kong police to draft in 200 special officers as protests roll on 23 Nov 2019 In Tuen Mun, pro-establishment councillor Kam Man-fung said he was just resting on Saturday as Sunday would be a long day. “The election this year is no longer about district work.

Speaking for some for them, retired station sergeant Joe Chan Cho-kwong, who previously led the Junior Police Officers’ Association, said: “Elections should still be about personal ability, rather than the party or camp that the candidate represents.” He is running against barrister Mark Leung Hon-kei and pro-establishment-friendly councillor Fu Pik-chun.

Police have become a key target of anger for Hongkongers over the past months of unrest, with officers accused of excessive use of force. Speaking in an interview with state broadcaster CCTV, Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu said apart from police officers stationed at polling stations and patrolling nearby, the force’s quick response teams would be on standby to deal with emergency situations. The city’s railway operator, the MTR Corporation, said all train services on Sunday would be maintained until 11pm.

CK Asset Holdings, the city's second-largest developer, on Saturday sold only six out of 180 available flats at its Seaside Sonata project in Cheung Sha Wan. The poor sales as of 6pm were evidence of the grim sentiment of homebuyers as the worst political crisis in Hong Kong’s history continues to roil the city. The sluggish residential sales have become a trend despite the government’s initiatives to relax mortgage lending rules for first-time buyers. “Buyers are staying on the sidelines,” said Sammy Po Siu-ming, chief executive of Midland Realty’s residential division. “They would like to wait until the social movement is over.”  By late October, the Seaside Sonata project had sold 65 out of 149 units in the protest-hit district of Sham Shui Po. Previous transactions in the development had a selling price of between HK$7.14 million (US$826,000) and HK$16.9 million. New Hong Kong property projects fail to dazzle as buyers turn to secondary market amid downbeat sentiment 25 Oct 2019 New Hong Kong property projects fail to dazzle as buyers turn to secondary market amid downbeat sentiment 25 Oct 2019 The weak demand for new homes on Saturday came after a week that posted the worst performance of Hong Kong residential property since the anti-government protest crisis erupted in June. By November 17, only four out of 144 units at Chinachem Group’s Sol City development in Yuen Long had been sold, according to agents. That day, less than 10 potential buyers were at the sales office at Nina Tower in Tsuen Wan when sales commenced at 10am.  In October, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor raised the mortgage cap to 90 per cent, from 60 per cent, for homes valued up to HK$8 million, and to 80 per cent, from 50 per cent, for homes valued up to HK$10 million. The measure was meant to give first-time homebuyers an advantage and help ease the city’s housing crisis.  Despite the recent dismal sales, the Knight Frank property consultancy said the relaxation of the mortgage cap helped bring buyers back to the housing market. The company said in its latest report that Hong Kong’s overall sales volume grew 16.1 per cent to 4,001 units in October, reversing two consecutive months of declines. Hong Kong records worst weekend sales of homes since June as intensifying violence keeps buyers away 18 Nov 2019 Hong Kong records worst weekend sales of homes since June as intensifying violence keeps buyers away 18 Nov 2019 Knight Frank said first-time buyers could now afford to purchase small- to medium-sized units instead of nano flats, the term for flats measuring less than 200 sq ft. “Developers offered flexible payment plans and discounts for both new home projects and unsold stocks, which spurred homebuyers to speed up purchases in the primary market,” the company report said. It cited the 375 units in The Grand Marine in Tsing Yi and the 167 units of Emerald Bay in Tuen Mun – all of which were sold. Knight Frank said other factors would also boost transactions in the residential market, including the implementation of the vacancy tax – which seeks to punish developers for hoarding newly completed flats amid soaring prices – and a likely cut in interest rates.

His comments come as US President Donald Trump considers signing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act – passed by the US Congress earlier in the week – into law. US President Donald Trump Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act “The United States has grossly interfered in China’s internal affairs with its domestic laws, attempting to undermine China’s ‘one country, two systems’, and Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability,” Wang said. As a global power, the US should shoulder more international responsibility, but instead it was damaging multilateralism and the global trade regime, he said.  “The US has become the biggest source of uncertainty in the world.” Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it Also on Saturday, Beijing said in a newspaper editorial that any attempt to disrupt China’s development and interfere in Hong Kong affairs was “doomed to fail”, while its ambassador to Canada warned the North American nation against following Washington’s lead in passing legislation on human rights and democracy in the troubled city. Hong Kong Cong Peiwu, who took over as ambassador to Canada in September, said on Friday in Ottawa that the interests of 300,000 Canadian citizens in Hong Kong were at risk if the North American nation passed a similar bill.  Doing so would be “very dangerous”, he said. In a strongly worded editorial published in the Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily said that any act that harmed the interests of another nation would be rejected by the international community. People’s Daily  The article came despite US President Donald Trump hinting on Friday that he might not sign the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act – which was passed by the US Congress earlier in the week – in an apparent effort not to derail the ongoing trade talks. US President Donald Trump Trump has until December 2 to sign the final version of the bill, which passed through the House of Representatives on a 417-1 vote on Wednesday, into law or veto it. If he does neither, it will become law automatically. The legislation paves the way for sanctions against individuals deemed responsible for actions to undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy, such as the rendition to the mainland of anyone exercising “internationally recognised human rights in Hong Kong”. In an interview on the news programme Fox & Friends on Friday, Trump said he stood with Hong Kong but had to balance his priorities while trying to reach a deal with Beijing. Fox & Friends “I would like to see them work it out. We have to see them work it out. I stand with Hong Kong, I stand with freedom, I stand with all the things we want to do, but we also are in the process of making the largest trade deal in history. And if we could do that, that would be great,” he said. He even boasted that he was the only reason China had not forcibly intervened in the protests, which began in June and have plunged Hong Kong into chaos. “If it weren’t for me, Hong Kong would have been obliterated in 14 minutes,” the president said. China threatens ‘forceful measures’ in response to US bill on Hong Kong rights China threatens ‘forceful measures’ in response to US bill on Hong Kong rights China threatens ‘forceful measures’ in response to US bill on Hong Kong rights The People’s Daily editorial said that in passing the act US Congress was “confusing right and wrong” and “backing Hong Kong – disrupting forces and mobs”. People’s Daily The act was a political conspiracy designed to “plunge Hong Kong into the abyss of continual turmoil and curb China’s development”, it said. It also blamed “anti-China forces in the US” for teaming up with “anti-China forces in Hong Kong”, and said that passing the act glorified the actions of the rioters. The passage of the US act comes at a delicate time for US-China relations as negotiators from the two sides seek to finalise a phase one trade deal. Pompeo signals Trump is taking a harder line on China 16 Nov 2019 Pompeo signals Trump is taking a harder line on China 16 Nov 2019 Tao Wenzhao, a researcher at the Institute of American Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said Trump’s remarks showed the importance of the trade talks. “Trump might want to see how the deal goes before he decides to sign the act,” he said. “If a deal is reached that satisfies Trump, he may veto the legislation.” For US Congress to override a presidential veto it must achieve a two-thirds majority in both the Senate and House of Representatives. Pang Zhongying, an international relations professor at the Ocean University of China in Qingdao, said Trump might be using Hong Kong as leverage in the negotiations. The president was reluctant to veto the bill as it would put him under pressure from Congress, but not doing so would be seen as a goodwill gesture by Beijing, he said. 	SCMP

Two pro-democracy figures, former lawmaker Emily Lau Wai-hing and activist Figo Chan Ho-wun of Civil Human Rights Front, will accept the honour on Saturday on behalf of all Hongkongers. The US Congress earlier this week passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which will introduce stringent monitoring and possible sanctions against individuals found to be diminishing the city’s freedoms. Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act President Donald Trump has yet to give a clear indication on whether he will sign the act into law. Cindy McCain, the wife of Senator McCain who died in 2018, said: “I hope this tribute to those who are struggling for their rights in Hong Kong will encourage more people around the world to raise their voices in support of their cause, especially in my country’s government. They are fighting for something larger than themselves.”  She has also commended the US Congress for passing the act with a nearly unanimous vote and urged the president to sign it into law. They are fighting for something larger than themselves Cindy McCain, the wife of Senator McCain The second annual award will be presented at the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada on Saturday, or about 10pm Saturday on Hong Kong time. Cindy McCain serves as a board member of the forum, which had been supported by her husband. Peter Van Praagh, the president of the forum, on Friday said the forum would be the first international organisation to recognise the people of Hong Kong for the current protest movement. current protest movement  “Of course, there will be some – perhaps many – who criticise or even attack us for commending individuals who stand for freedom, who take risks for freedom, who demand freedom,” Van Praagh in his opening address.  Also attending the forum were Robert O’Brien, the national security adviser to President Trump, and Harjit Sajjan, Canada’s minister of national defence. Lau, a former chair of the Democratic Party of Hong Kong, said she was thankful for the international support, which some view as a direct challenge to Beijing. “Everybody knows this is a David-vs-Goliath struggle,” Laus said. “And that’s why they so admired the Hong Kong peoples’ courage and will to fight for something everyone in the forum shares: freedom, rule of law, democracy, human rights and personal safety.” She continued: “Many Hong Kong people will be thankful for the prize and that the US and Canada choose to stand behind Hong Kong.” Speaking at a session of the Halifax forum, Lau emphasised that most people in Hong Kong were not fighting for independence, but only striving for greater democracy and defending the freedoms they already enjoy. for greater democracy “Most of us are not fighting for independence, don’t let the Chinese government misinform you,” she said. “What we are fighting for is for China to keep the promise in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and the 1997 Basic Law, that Hong Kong can continue to enjoy a capitalist system, our rule of law and our personal safety for 50 years, until 2047.” Lau pointed out that Western countries have investments and citizens in Hong Kong that justify their concern for the city.

The 43-year-old was on Friday arrested in Kwun Tong on suspicion of obstructing police officers from executing their duties, the force confirmed. He was accused of using a mobile phone to record officers in the middle of their operation on Sunday at the Hong Kong Museum of History, near Polytechnic University (PolyU), as well as uploading the picture on social media. Inside the besieged Hong Kong Polytechnic University Inside the besieged Hong Kong Polytechnic University Inside the besieged Hong Kong Polytechnic University The campus on Chatham Road South in Tsim Sha Tsui was the scene of fierce clashes between radicals and police, later developing into a stand-off that lasted for days. A police source confirmed that the officers involved were from the elite Special Duties Unit or so-called Flying Tigers. The suspect was a contract employee of the museum. The offence carries a maximum penalty of two years’ imprisonment.  Hong Kong has been gripped by more than five months of social unrest, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed for the transfer of fugitives to jurisdictions with which the city has no such agreement, including mainland China. ‘Prison flying tigers’ join fight against Hong Kong protesters 17 Nov 2019 ‘Prison flying tigers’ join fight against Hong Kong protesters 17 Nov 2019 The protests have since morphed into a wider anti-government movement focused on universal suffrage and an independent investigation into police’s use of force. On Sunday, riot police surrounded and laid siege to PolyU, the last stronghold of hardcore protesters, who also disrupted traffic arteries and crippled the nearby Cross-Harbour Tunnel, which is still out of service.  As of Saturday this weekend, most of the radicals have left the campus, with police arresting hundreds at checkpoints out of the university. 	SCMP

More than 100 protesters, mostly wearing masks and dressed in black, marched peacefully from Suffolk Road in Kowloon Tong to La Salle Primary School. The action came after concerns were raised over dioxins released into the environment from the wide usage of tear gas. Police said the turnout peaked at 130. Holding posters and the hands of their young children, the parents chanted slogans such as “Protect children, the government is responsible” and “Disclose the composition of tear gas”. Stephanie Sum Yi-ching, organiser of the police-approved march, said there were many prestigious schools along the route and she hoped officials would pay attention to the pollution caused by police.  “Police’s use of tear gas is really too much,” Sum said. “The tear gas residue is everywhere, even in schools or parks. It really affects our children’s health.” Protesters, police clash over mysterious smell leading to claims of chemical testing 29 Oct 2019 Protesters, police clash over mysterious smell leading to claims of chemical testing 29 Oct 2019 The mother of two said her six-year-old daughter was affected by an unknown gas in Tuen Mun and suffered allergic reactions in her eyes for a week. Sum was referring to a mysterious stench in the area in October, which residents claimed was tear gas coming from a police facility. There were complaints from people about skin, eye and throat discomfort.  In that incident – which sparked clashes between protesters and officers – police denied they were testing tear gas, with the government failing to find a source for the smell. In recent weeks, another discussion over tear gas was sparked after a frontline reporter revealed he was diagnosed with chloracne – a skin condition linked to exposure to dioxins.  At Saturday’s march, occupational therapist Lam Bok, 34, said Hong Kong had become a “city of toxic gas”, adding his friend’s children experienced skin redness a day after they walked on streets where tear gas was released. “It’s useless to fire tear gas. If it’s effective, the protests won’t last more than five months,” said Lam, who brought along his seven-year-old son, Moses.   William Lee, 50, who works in the financial services sector, admitted he was worried about the health effects from the chemical canisters, as the government had not disclosed their composition. He said his family always walked around protest hotspots such as Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui and hoped officers would not abuse the use of the non-lethal weapons. In a reply to the Post on marchers’ demands, police said they used tear gas to create a safe distance and reduce direct clashes with protesters, making dispersal effective. The force also said officers had strict guidelines on using ammunitions and would take reference from information provided by manufacturers to ensure the weapons were deployed in a safe and normal manner. Post    On Wednesday, Secretary for Food and Health Professor Sophia Chan Siu-chee said the Department of Health and the Poison Information Centre under the Hospital Authority found no literature or scientific evidence on dioxin-poisoning cases caused by the use of tear gas. But she refused to reveal the composition of the chemicals, saying it would be “inappropriate” to disclose procurement details of the equipment used by the force, as that would “affect police’s operational capability”. Shops hit by tear gas during the latest Hong Kong protest open for business despite lingering smell Shops hit by tear gas during the latest Hong Kong protest open for business despite lingering smell Shops hit by tear gas during the latest Hong Kong protest open for business despite lingering smell Professor Chan King-ming of Chinese University’s school of life sciences insisted there was no evidence proving the firing of tear gas would release dioxins. “I don’t believe that tear gas, even when burning at high temperatures, can produce dioxins,” he said. The academic and the university are testing a total of 20 soil samples to find out if volleys of tear gas shot on campus in fiery clashes this month had raised chemical levels there. Last Tuesday, more than 1,000 rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets were fired at students who responded with hundreds of petrol bombs. From the preliminary test results of two samples, Chan said a dioxin-like compound – commonly found in soil samples – was detected, and the level was within the acceptable range for residential areas. He added the most toxic variation of this compound, usually generated from the burning of waste, was not found. The Sha Tin university said it had received initial test results on campus soil and found no cyanide in the samples. All offices at Chinese University would resume operations on Monday. 	SCMP

Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor “As I fly over your territory I extend my best wishes to your excellency and your fellow citizens,” he wrote. “Invoking divine blessings, I pray that almighty God may grant you all well-being and peace.” In addition to Lam, the Pope sent similarly diplomatic telegrams to Chinese President Xi Jinping and Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. Xi Jinping Tsai Ing-wen To Xi, the Pope sent his cordial greetings as he was flying over Hainan island. “I assure you of my prayers for the nation and its people, invoking upon all of you abundant blessings of peace and joy,” he said.

Erica Ng and Stephen Wong, members of the Federation of Catholic Students, said they exchanged a few words with the Pope and gave him a letter detailing the mass protests while attending the International Youth Forum in Vatican. They said they asked the pontiff to pray for Hong Kong.  Papal protocol requires the sending of these telegrams and Francis has used them in the past to speak to the Beijing government, which severed relations with the Holy See more than five decades ago. Francis has been eager to unite China’s official and underground Catholic churches, and the Vatican and China penned an accord last year over the nomination of bishops which was meant to heal the rift. But tensions still exist, and the Vatican’s continued relations with Taiwan remain a sore spot. 	SCMP

Ken Woo Kwok-wang, 22, was accompanied by Rodney Chu Wai-chi – an assistant professor from Polytechnic University’s department of applied social sciences – and lawmaker Kwok Ka-ki as he left the Hung Hom campus at about 6pm. He was escorted to a police vehicle. Kwok said Woo was arrested, though it was unclear why, and taken to Hung Hom Police Station. He described the arrest as “unnecessary” and said Woo was just protecting the school and providing support to those on campus as a students’ union leader. “There have been fewer people inside PolyU and we did not find any new cases requiring our assistance,” he said.  Another protester, known as “the chef”, left at around 4pm. He was accompanied by Theresa Chan Kam-mi, a pastor and the wife of Reverend Yuen Tin-yau, the former president of the Hong Kong Christian Council.  “He was emotionally disturbed and felt weak as he hadn’t slept for a few nights,” Chan said.  Another protester, who gave his name as Ah Cheung and had been on campus for about a week, admitted he had also experienced fluctuating emotions in the past few days and expressed concerns about those who remained. “Normal people should not be able to stand it after being trapped for six or seven days,” the 20-year-old protester said. “People might be in a state of giving up, crying, and feeling immensely stressed.” He worried the trapped would develop suicidal thoughts, which had also appeared in his mind for a flashing moment. “Every day seemed very long and it was hard to get through,” he said. Ah Cheung, who said the risks of trying to escape were too high, estimated that around 50 to 100 people were still inside the campus. At 1.15am on Saturday, the fire department answered a call to search for missing radicals thought to have tried to flee via underground tunnels, when abandoned personal belongings were discovered next to a manhole. Firefighters and divers were deployed, but the operation was later judged a false alarm. Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung on Saturday morning said it saddened him to see radicals occupying campuses in recent weeks, turning the academic institutions into arsenals “strewn with explosives” and anti-government strongholds. But the veteran minister admitted the city had much to do to reconnect with the younger generation. Speaking on a radio programme, Cheung said it was time for the last holdouts to leave. “The government and police are both worried about the people staying there and hope they can stay calm and come up peacefully and sensibly,” he said. Heaps of rubbish, plastic bottles and bags, clothes and other items littered different corners of the university’s podium and indoor areas. Unused petrol bombs, chemicals, gas cylinders and bottles of cooking oil were all seen in several areas, but few protesters were still visible. Inside the occupied Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus Inside the occupied Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus Inside the occupied Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus The campus has been a war zone for almost two weeks. Radicals first occupied the site in support of Chinese University students who clashed with police on their Sha Tin campus, the latest escalation in nearly six months of political unrest. Police used water cannons and tear gas on and around the PolyU campus, while protesters hurled bricks, petrol bombs and other projectiles in return. More than 1,000 people have been arrested or had their details recorded by police since officers besieged the PolyU campus on Sunday evening – including 300 under the age of 18.

It will be the second batch of special officers seconded to the embattled force, after about 90 elite prison officers, nicknamed the Prison Flying Tigers, reported for duty with the police last week. Government sources said on Saturday the temporary recruits – about 100 from the Immigration Department and a similar number from the Customs and Excise Department – would be brought in on a voluntary basis and help the force with support work. “Though these law enforcers have received basic arms training, including using a revolver as well as batons and pepper spray, they won’t be deployed to the front line to deal with protesters. Their duties will be assigned according to the force’s needs,” one source said.

The shotguns, which can fire beanbag rounds and rubber bullets, are commonly seen wielded by police at protest dispersal operations.

Police officers and even the new cops from the prison authority have fallen victim to doxxing.”   It was understood that newly installed police chief Chris Tang Ping-keung would officially appoint the loanees next week. When on duty, they will wear armbands stating that they are special constables. Last Friday, then police commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung appointed no more than 100 prison officers as special constables. “Depending on the police’s manpower needs and development of the social events, the government does not preclude the appointment of officers of other local disciplined services as special constables in the future to alleviate the burden of the police,” a government spokesman said in a statement last Thursday. Hong Kong has been rocked by citywide anti-government protests since June. The unrest, which stems from the now-withdrawn extradition bill, has escalated into violence on the streets, MTR subway stations and some university campuses.

Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said various government departments mobilised about 380 people on Friday to start repairs and maintenance on the tunnel, which had been closed and vandalised by anti-government protesters. The radical activists severely damaged the Hung Hom entrance of the tunnel, throwing petrol bombs at toll booths and setting fire to a footbridge linking Polytechnic University and Hung Hom MTR station. Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme on Saturday, Cheung said fire-prevention, ventilation and other monitoring systems of the tunnel were all damaged, but the government had been doing its “very best” to reopen the main artery linking Hung Hom and Causeway Bay next week.

But we aim to do it later in the week.” Cheung said that, apart from repairing the systems, parts of the highway leading to the tunnel also need to be repaired.  He said the government would allow temporary free use of the tunnel if repairs to the toll booths took longer than the work on the rest of the system.

Cheung noted that the services had been popular, and the ferries packed, especially during rush hour. “We will arrange larger ferries to run on those routes, and aim at increasing the number of journeys so that ferries can run on those routes every 20 minutes,” he pledged. The tunnel had been out of action since Wednesday last week, when protesters put up barricades of chairs, tables and boards commandeered from the neighbouring Polytechnic University campus. From Sunday evening, police surrounded the campus following a day of extremely violent clashes which the force declared a riot. About 1,000 people have walked off the site through police checkpoints since then. Among them, roughly 300 were aged below 18. Officers recorded their personal information before they were allowed to go home. The rest were arrested. On Saturday morning, dozens remained on the campus. 	SCMP

Councillors serve as a line of communication between citizens and the government, handling community-level affairs such as transport and public facilities across the city’s 18 districts. The elections, which allow voters to directly elect district council members, take place every four years. For the first time, all 452 seats are being contested, with 1,090 candidates competing. During the last elections in 2015, the pro-establishment camp won 298 out of the 431 contested seats, while the pan-democrats took 126 and independents got seven. Why do the elections matter? Why do the elections matter? This will be the first election since mass protests erupted in the city in June. The protests, which were triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be transferred to mainland China, have evolved into a wider anti-government campaign. protests extradition bill Ma Ngok, an associate professor in politics at Chinese University, said the protests had politicised voter sentiment.  He said people may vote according to their stance on the protests, although the elections are mainly focused on how hopefuls had served local communities. As the first poll since the extradition bill movement, the results will “have a more symbolic meaning rather than an actual change in governance”, according to Ivan Choy Chi-keung, senior lecturer in politics at Chinese University, as district councils serve as advisory boards in local communities. Who has a vote? Who has a vote? A total of 4.12 million registered voters – roughly 55 per cent of Hong Kong’s population of 7.39 million people – can cast their ballots on Sunday. Extra security, polling stations moved as Hong Kong readies for elections 20 Nov 2019 Extra security, polling stations moved as Hong Kong readies for elections 20 Nov 2019 Nearly 386,000 new voters were registered in the space of a year, according to figures released by the Registration and Electoral Office in August. The surge was driven by a 12.3 per cent rise in registrations from those aged 18 to 35, who have been the most responsive group to heed protesters’ calls to sign up in the hopes of ousting pro-government politicians.  A record 47 per cent of registered voters cast ballots in the 2015 elections. Choy said the turnout this time could be similar or slightly higher. How might the ongoing protests affect voting behaviour? How might the ongoing protests affect voting behaviour? Hong Kong is divided between those who back the pro-democracy protesters and police supporters who tend to side with pro-establishment politicians.  The pro-establishment camp has dominated district council elections because of stronger ties with grass-roots communities, which consist of new migrant families from mainland China and the elderly, according to Edmund Cheng Wai, associate professor of politics at City University. Although moderates may have moved towards the pro-democracy camp in earlier polls, Cheng said escalating tensions in society might affect people’s willingness to go out and vote for them.

Are the elections expected to run successfully? Whether the elections can take place smoothly has been a genuine concern of voters and officials, as the city’s roads and metro stations have been blocked or vandalised during protests. Polling stations near university campuses, where radicals have clashed with police, have also become inaccessible. Riot police will for the first time be deployed at all polling stations. Nearly all of the 31,000-strong force has to report for duty on Sunday, according to a senior police source. Polling stations near university campuses have been relocated to neighbouring schools or sports facilities. The Election Affairs Commission has also hired more security guards. If the elections do not go on as planned, a December 1 backup date has been set. What are the protesters’ plans? What are the protesters’ plans? Anti-government protesters have vowed to take their battle to the ballot box in these elections to flip pro-establishment seats, and are taking precautions to avoid invalidating their votes. Online tips for voters who support the pro-democracy movement have circulated on social media platforms such as Instagram, messaging app Telegram and Reddit-like platform LIHKG. The posts advised voters not to wear black clothes and masks for fear of being targeted by riot police stationed at polling stations.

Dressed casually, they were busy taking notes and pictures of the presentation slides. They were all looking for somewhere to move to, away from the chaos of Hong Kong. chaos of Hong Kong The presentation that day was about the Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H) scheme, a residence-by-investment programme offered by the Southeast Asian country.

Those under 50 must make a bank deposit of at least HK$600,000. The discussion was vigorous, with many questions.  “How can a housewife or retiree prove that they have a monthly income to fulfil the eligibility requirements?” “Can a self-use property produce a monthly income? What’s the trick?” Riot police to guard all polling stations in Hong Kong for first time 22 Nov 2019 Riot police to guard all polling stations in Hong Kong for first time 22 Nov 2019 “What if one family member has a criminal record?”  It became clear that most in the room were not desperate to quit Hong Kong immediately, but were drawing up their “Plan B” in case the city becomes too dangerous or dismal to live in.  Vincent Fong, founder of MM2H Club, a consulting agency for the Malaysian scheme, says that over the past three months, his agency has submitted about 800 applications to the Malaysian government, equivalent to the total it handled over the previous decade. Other companies that provide emigration help and information say they have also seen a spike in interest, coinciding with the unrest now in its sixth month. Hongkongers have also been inquiring about moving to .   Originally I planned to take my time to weigh the different relocation options. But Hong Kong’s situation is getting more chaotic, with stand-offs between police and the protesters becoming really violent. I am worried that this will become a vicious cycle Edwin Yuen, legal executive Police figures show there were 13,810 applications for those certificates from July to October, up sharply from 8,019 over the same period last year. Among those at the Malaysian session were legal executive Edwin Yuen, 51, and his wife, Connie, 53, who have been mulling a move for some time but are now speeding up their relocation. “Originally I planned to take my time to weigh the different relocation options,” Yuen says. “But Hong Kong’s situation is getting more chaotic, with stand-offs between police and the protesters becoming really violent. I am worried that this will become a vicious cycle.” At first he was looking for a place that would provide a comfortable retirement for him and his wife. Now he is also looking for a country where their sons can find jobs and have bright futures. “Our considerations are actually not about the erosion of freedom in Hong Kong. We are not activists, so we aren’t worried about Hong Kong’s politics,” he says. “We are simply pessimistic about Hong Kong’s economic prospects because of the social instability, and my children’s future is a concern.” He has narrowed the choice to Malaysia or Thailand, as both require relatively low investments. Thailand has the edge, he says, because he has friends there and its well-developed hotel industry might offer career opportunities for his elder son, who is studying hotel management. “I reckon that in Thailand, my family and I will have more opportunities,” says Yuen, who hopes to move within a year. Paediatric nurse Carmen Tam, 41, says that from the day their son Harvey was born 12 years ago, she and her husband have been working out ways to ensure that he leaves Hong Kong and avoids becoming “mainlandised”, a concern for some city residents who decry the impact of Beijing’s influence on local affairs and the arrival of migrants from the rest of China. “I don’t want him to be confined in Hong Kong and become another mainlander. When he was a toddler, I only spoke to him in English and never taught him any Chinese,” she says. “Since kindergarten, I’ve put him in an international school. In primary school and his current secondary school, he’s only learned Japanese and English, so he speaks very little Cantonese.” Her dream is for her son to study in Japan and settle there. “I love everything about Japan, especially its culture,” she says. Tam says the Tiananmen Square crackdown on pro-democracy student protesters in 1989 remains vivid in her memory. Her deep anti-mainland feelings were reinforced when she witnessed, as a student nurse, pregnant mainlanders flooding Hong Kong’s public hospitals to give birth and ensure the right of abode for their children.

She and her husband are considering moving to somewhere like Malaysia or Taiwan, where there are people who speak Chinese. “At this moment, everybody in Hong Kong is finding a way out, either through relocation or emigration, as we look for some kind of security for ourselves,” she says. Finance executive Kenneth Lo, 52, has already moved. He gave up a well-paying job and moved to Toronto, Canada, at the end of August. His wife, a toy designer, and their 11-year-old son will join him next year. They decided to emigrate to give the boy a better education. “I’ve all along disliked the spoon-feeding and examination-oriented education system in Hong Kong. I hope my child can be exposed to the multifaceted Western education so he can learn to think freely and embrace universal values,” he says. This is not his first move to Canada. His father took the family there in 1997, after Hong Kong was returned by Britain to China and they had permanent residence. But the family later returned to Hong Kong. Lo thought his Canadian residency status had been revoked after so many years, so he was pleasantly surprised to learn last year that he was still considered a resident there. I have nothing to fear for myself if I stay in Hong Kong. But considering my child will have to face a very complicated political environment, I am more convinced that I made a good decision to ensure a better future for him Kenneth Lo, recent emigrant That led to the decision to emigrate, which comes with a steep price tag, as Lo and his wife are giving up jobs with a combined income of more than HK$1 million (US$127,800) a year. “Of course we went through some struggling, as we’ll need to start from zero in Canada. This is not an easy decision, but we reckon we’ll be able to lead a simple life in Toronto after we sell our house in Hong Kong,” he says. With the current political turmoil in Hong Kong, Lo is glad he made the decision to move his family. “I have nothing to fear for myself if I stay in Hong Kong,” he says. “But considering my child will have to face a very complicated political environment, I am more convinced that I made a good decision to ensure a better future for him.” MM2H’s Fong is certain the unrest has boosted interest in emigration. “Since June, the number of cases we received has started to jump,” he says. “The August figure was about 10 times of that in July. Now there are more than 700 applications in the queue.” Applicants seeking a better future for their children are attracted by the lower international school fees in Malaysia compared with those in Hong Kong, he adds. Ivan Mak, head of Hong Kong for the AIMS Immigration and Relocation Group, says his outfit is handling about 200 applicants a month now, about a tenfold increase from two years ago. Australia, Canada, and Britain are among the most popular destinations for applicants. “Many of them are making the move for their children, as they are concerned about their children’s education,” Mak says. Paul Bernadou, who set up an emigration consulting agency in Hong Kong named after himself in 1993, also has no doubt that the increased interest in emigration and relocation is linked mainly to the social unrest. “The push is coming from the current unsettled conditions which are, for most people, unprecedented. Their children’s future is most important,” he says. “The protests have opened their eyes, and they realise they need to start planning now for the future, even if things settle down.” 	SCMP

The notice, issued by police management on Thursday, also said that anyone who failed to remove a face covering could be charged with obstructing officers in exercising their duty – an offence punishable by up to two years in prison, as opposed to the one-year jail term under the mask ban. The High Court ruled on Monday that both the ban and the application of a colonial-era emergency law that invoked the measure on the grounds of public danger were unconstitutional. The Department of Justice asked the court to suspend its ruling, which the government was expected to appeal against. On Friday, the court suspended the ruling for seven days but warned it did not mean the ban had ceased to be invalid, even though enforcement of the judgment would be postponed. court suspended the ruling Hong Kong’s local elections on schedule despite anti-government protests Hong Kong’s local elections on schedule despite anti-government protests Hong Kong’s local elections on schedule despite anti-government protests “Owing to the recent judicial review ruling on the Emergency Regulations Ordinance and Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation, all [mask] enforcement actions have been temporarily suspended pending further judicial adjudication,” the circular from police’s crime wing reads. “In the interim, it is acknowledged that in the course of duty, there could be many occasions when identification is crucial, which furthered by reasonable suspicion, may render it necessary for officers to demand a member of the public remove a face covering for identification purposes.”  The circular cited three existing laws that officers could rely on to request the removal of a mask. They include the power to stop and search someone under the Police Force Ordinance, the power to ask anyone to produce proof of identity to help prevent or investigate any offence under the Public Order Ordinance, and to require a person to produce a Hong Kong identity card under the Immigration Ordinance. Police confirmed that if the situation required, officers may demand a person remove a face covering for identification purposes in accordance with existing statutory provisions.  University of Hong Kong law professor Johannes Chan Man-mun, part of the legal team fighting the mask ban, said existing laws stopped police from arbitrarily requiring a person to remove a face covering, unlike the ban. “Officers still need to have a reasonable suspicion based on a person’s actions,” Chan said.  For example, if a masked person walked near Polytechnic University, where protesters are holed up after police surrounded the campus, officers could not ask the person to remove the face covering under existing laws, he said. Chan added this also showed police’s power to request someone to remove masks was already covered by the law. “This shows the anti-mask law is not required. It’s just redundant and serves no useful purpose.” A lawyer specialising in criminal and human rights law, who preferred not to be named, pointed to another problem. He said the Immigration Ordinance required officers to be in uniform or able to provide identification documents. During the ongoing protests, he said, many police officers failed to wear their unique identification numbers. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor announced in early October she would invoke the colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance, which gives her far-reaching powers, to enact the mask ban. The measure was an attempt to quell escalating levels of violence during anti-government protests that have rocked the city for months.

More than six months of pro-democracy demonstrations in the city, some of which have been violent and deadly, are “a complicating factor”, Trump said in an interview on Fox & Friends. Fox & Friends He also declined to say whether he would sign recently passed legislation that would counter any moves seen as undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy from mainland China, prompting responses in support of the bill from some senior US lawmakers. “If it weren’t for me, Hong Kong would have been obliterated in 14 minutes,” he said.   China has “a million soldiers standing outside of Hong Kong that aren’t going in only because I asked him, please don’t do that,” Trump said, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping. “You’ll be making a big mistake, it’s going to have a tremendous negative impact on the trade deal, and he wants to make a trade deal.” Trump added that China has “been taking advantage of us for 25 years. It’s hard for them to understand it’s not going to happen any more, and now they understand.”  There have been 13 rounds of trade talks over the past year and a half, the latest of which took place on October 11 in Washington, after which Trump met the Chinese negotiating team at the White House. After an investigation into China’s trade and market access practices that started in 2017, the US government imposed tariffs on some US$360 billion in Chinese imports and is planning new punitive duties to take effect on December 15. No deadline for resolving university siege crisis: Hong Kong police chief 22 Nov 2019 No deadline for resolving university siege crisis: Hong Kong police chief 22 Nov 2019 Earlier this month, China’s Ministry of Commerce said the two sides had agreed to remove additional tariffs in phases once their leaders sign an interim deal. But a day later, Trump denied the claim, saying he had not agreed to roll back US duties.  In the interview on Friday, Trump said he was expecting more concessions from Beijing because the US has been giving China “US$500 billion a year, and that’s not including theft of intellectual property, et cetera”.   Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it Trump often refers to China’s surplus of trade in goods with the US as a key measure of the overall economic relationship. That imbalance hit a record US$420 billion in 2018, according to US government data. Instead of saying whether he would sign the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act into law, Trump said that he stood with Hong Kong, with “freedom” and with Xi, and then mentioned the trade negotiations. “We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I’m also standing with President Xi,” Trump said. “He’s a friend of mine. He’s an incredible guy.” Trump likely to sign Hong Kong democracy bill, sponsor Rubio says 23 Nov 2019 Trump likely to sign Hong Kong democracy bill, sponsor Rubio says 23 Nov 2019 “I’d like to see them work it out,” he added. “We have to see them work it out, but I stand with Hong Kong. I stand with freedom. I stand with all the things we want to do, but we’re also in the process of making the largest trade deal in history, and if we could do that, that would be great.” A final version of the Hong Kong bill, which has infuriated Beijing, passed the House of Representatives on a 417-1 vote on Wednesday. Trump has until December 2 to sign the bill into law or veto it. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat representing New York, slammed Trump for his mixed messaging about the legislation, which would require the US secretary of state to certify annually whether Hong Kong has remained sufficiently autonomous from China to keep the distinct trading status it enjoys with Washington.

Being tough on China when it comes to human rights will also help us win the battle on trade,” he added.

Candidates in the pro-establishment camp feared that while many voters were worn down by the seemingly never-ending violence and chaos, they still blamed the government and would take their anger out on the bloc. “It will be a tough battle,” said Chan Hok-fung, vice-chairman of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB). “A lot of people support the violence so the situation is beyond what we can predict and assess.” But there was little more optimism on the other side of the divide. Analysts have warned the increasing violence could sway voters away from the opposition pan-democrats too. “The pan-democrats have the upper hand, but it isn’t one-sided. I think some voters have switched to the pro-establishment side, so I remain cautious,” said Democratic Party vice-chairman Lo Kin-hei.  Chan and Lo are seeking re-election in Central and Western, and Southern districts respectively. Chan’s opponents are Wong Kin-ching and Lam Suet-ying, while Lo’s sole rival is DAB candidate Tan Jinjie. Messages circulating online warned young voters not to wear masks or black to avoid being targeted by riot police stationed at the polls.  There were also calls for people to vote early, amid rumours “emergency situations” could force polling stations to close as early as 10.30am and ballots then being counted. The Registration and Electoral Office clarified that in the event of an emergency, voting at specific polling stations would either be resumed within 90 minutes, or postponed until December 1.  The police force has taken steps to ensure the election runs smoothly. The city’s new police commissioner, Chris Tang Ping-keung, said on Friday that sufficient manpower would be deployed at all polling stations to guard against interference. “Any violence and disturbance will be against all 7 million people in Hong Kong,” Tang said. The city’s embattled rail operator, the MTR Corp, will increase security on Sunday fearing the situation could get chaotic, according to Hong Kong Federation of Railway Trade Unions vice-chairman Tam Kin-chiu. About 1,500 security staff will be deployed, 50 per cent more than on a usual protest weekend. A record 4.1 million Hong Kong residents are registered to vote in the District Council elections on Sunday, when 1,090 candidates will contest for 452 seats citywide. It will be the first time no candidate is returned uncontested in the district council polls. In 2011, the pro-establishment camp won about 300 of 412 district council seats, while the pro-democracy camp won about 100. A year after the Occupy protests, the number of district council seats increased to 431 in 2015, yet the pro-establishment camp failed to take advantage and still only managed to win about 300 seats, while pro-democracy candidates’ number of seats increased to about 130. The turnout rate reached a record of 47 per cent in that election. This Sunday, all eyes will be on how the two camps fare and how many voters will come out. Chinese University political scientist Ivan Choy Chi-keung said that while the turnout could set another record, the overall situation was more unpredictable than before. “The pan-democrats could have won a landslide victory if the elections had been held in the summer, when the protests erupted,” Choy said. “But after the recent clashes at two universities, undecided voters may be worried about public order and be discouraged from voting.” He was referring to fiery battles protesters fought with police outside Chinese University on November 12, followed by more confrontations outside Polytechnic University last week. “It will be difficult for the camp to win more than half of the seats, as some originally envisaged,” Choy said.

Henry Litton was commenting on Beijing’s challenge to a local court ruling that found an anti-mask law and the use of emergency laws unconstitutional. Mainland officials have argued “only” the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) has the power to decide on issues of constitutionality. But the retired Court of Final Appeal judge said he was surprised by the High Court’s ruling on Monday, saying the Emergency Regulations Ordinance was already in place since 1922 before the current administration invoked it to ban the use of face masks. Zang Tiewei, spokesman for the Legislative Affairs Commission of the NPCSC, said on Tuesday that the power to declare a local law incompatible with the Basic Law, or the city’s mini-constitution, rested on no other authority but the NPCSC. The view was strongly doubted by local lawyers, with former chief justice Andrew Li Kwok-nang saying it would be “surprising and alarming” if it was true. Litton said he believed Zang’s statement had left out the word “ultimate power” when describing constitutional interpretation. But he said Beijing was only using an emphatic way to make a statement without a change to the legal position. “I don’t think Beijing is Washington, where policy seems to flip-flop,” Litton said.  “Although I perfectly understand those who construe and interpret the statement literally … but it’s a shot across the bow. Just a reminder to Hong Kong citizens that the ultimate power of interpreting the Basic Law always rests with the NPCSC, it’s always embedded with Basic Law Article 159, which has never changed, and I think it’s unlikely to change.” Court suspends ruling that Hong Kong mask ban is unconstitutional 23 Nov 2019 Court suspends ruling that Hong Kong mask ban is unconstitutional 23 Nov 2019 He was referring to the Basic Law provision that Hong Kong courts were allowed to interpret the city’s mini-constitution, whether in political or civil disputes, so long as it fell within the area of the high degree of autonomy.   “If that’s the case, one would expect the mainland authorities to come back and say, ‘Oh no, we didn’t mean that’,” Dykes said.  He added the emergency laws were already dated back to almost 100 years, but under a different situation and constitutional system. “Old ordinances should have been re-examined to plug the new constitutional order,” he said. Ronny Tong Ka-wah, an adviser to Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, believed Zang was in fact referring to Beijing’s ultimate say on Basic Law interpretation, since a statement from the China’s liaison office in Hong Kong later also referred to the NPCSC’s ultimate power of interpretation. Beijing claim on ‘unconstitutional’ ruling could spell end of ‘one country, two systems’ 20 Nov 2019 Beijing claim on ‘unconstitutional’ ruling could spell end of ‘one country, two systems’ 20 Nov 2019 Tong agreed that as a matter of practicality, judges cannot shy away from ruling on constitutional matters. “I guess the misunderstanding stemmed from the part of judgment that the NPCSC ran through Emergency Regulations Ordinance before the handover, but the court did not deal with it, so the NPCSC may feel offended,” he said. Both Tong and Dykes urged Beijing to clarify the earlier statement. Litton, who retired in 2000 and is often regarded as a conservative judge who placed emphasis on the discipline of law, said judges and lawyers involved in the mask ban case created their own problems by engaging in a constitutional debate, when the subject matter was entirely about Hong Kong statutes. “The broad power encapsulated in the ordinance has to be very wide for obvious reasons, you can’t anticipate what may be the emergency that may arise,” Litton said in a media interview, adding he has yet to read the full judgment. “Every government will have laws for emergency.” “No one will disagree that the situation in October was not an emergency,” he said. He also reiterated his opposition to the protesters’ request for a judge-led inquiry into alleged police violence, saying the ongoing unrest which started in early June had made it impossible for such an inquiry to focus on just one aspect.

The six students who wrote the letter, which was posted on Facebook on Friday, told the Post they asked the queen to weigh in on protesters’ demands, which include universal suffrage and an independent investigation into the use of force by police. Post The 700-word letter started with a plea for the queen’s support in the “defence of freedom and democracy” in Hong Kong and background on how the now-withdrawn extradition bill had motivated an estimated two million people to take to the streets. The letter also highlighted allegations of police violence in the handling of the citywide protests. now-withdrawn extradition bill “Protesters, subdued arrestees, journalists and first-aiders are subjected to excessive, retaliatory and lethal violence,” the students’ letter said. It also mentioned Chow Tsz-lok, the University of Science and Technology student who fell to his death at a car park this month during a police dispersal operation, and the situation at Polytechnic University, where students have been besieged by police since Sunday. police since Sunday “This is our darkest hour, yet we shall never lose faith,” the letter said. The group also called on the queen and the British government to “react firmly to China’s violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration”.  The letter continued: “We plead, most humbly and sincerely, for Your Majesty’s support in our struggle to restore Hong Kong to its former glory and prosperity.” Queen Elizabeth School opened in Hong Kong in 1954. The school website said it was founded to coincide with Queen Elizabeth’s coronation in 1953.    “If she [the queen] does not reply, I’ll feel sad,” Janet said, “but if she does, it will be a bonus.” A student identified as Q said Hongkongers should “connect as many alliances as we can”. Q said the group hoped the queen and the British people would be “moved” by their letter, which might in turn raise awareness about the situation in Hong Kong. situation in Hong Kong Eric Chan Cheung-wai, principal of Queen Elizabeth School issued a statement on Friday saying the letter did not represent the stance of the school. He also slammed the writers, calling their act “absolutely irresponsible and unacceptable” by involving students in political propaganda. “We have solemnly made clear to all students that our school is a place to learn, and should not be used as a platform for expressing political demands,” the statement read. “We strongly condemn those with an ulterior motive who publicise their political stance in the name of our students to mislead the public.” He added that teachers would display professionalism and continue to provide guidance for students so they could focus on learning and distinguishing right from wrong, in a serene, peaceful and orderly environment. Buckingham Palace did not reply to questions by press time. Separately, a group of students and alumni from Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Lo Kon Ting Memorial College in Yuen Long demanded that school management review a decision to discipline five students who were said to have obstructed train doors on Wednesday. The group said school authorities lacked sympathy and were rushing to judgment over the incident. The school insisted that it had handled the case with “existing guidance and disciplinary mechanisms”. On Thursday, Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung said the Education Bureau had issued a letter to parents at 30 government-run secondary schools, advising them that students should not carry out political activities, such as strikes and human chains, at school. Yeung also said students should not wear school uniforms while taking part in political activities outside school. On Friday morning, about 10 students and alumni from St Francis Xavier’s School in Tsuen Wan attempted to form a human chain. Police arrived quickly to shut down the protest and check participants’ identification documents. 10 students and alumni from St Francis Xavier’s School in Tsuen Wan attempted to form a human chain.

The use of tear gas is estimated to have affected 88 per cent of the city’s residents. However, the government has so far refused to release information about the composition of tear gas, sparking widespread health concerns. extradition bill “We felt concerned about the way tear gas was being used, so we started researching,” said Dr Billy Hau Chi-hang, who was a member of the council between 2013 and 2018 and a signatory to the letter. “The picture is clear – in many countries where tear gas is used according to safety guidelines, there are no long-term effects. But, there are significant health risks if tear gas is used in narrow spaces or in large amounts on the same street,” he said. Hau said it was not their intention to help the government or protesters. “The government has a responsibility to tell people how to handle [tear gas] if it is using so much of it in an urban setting.” The letter was signed by 14 current and past members of the Advisory Council on the Environment, including former chairman Professor Lam Kin-che and current members Professors Albert Lee and Irene Lo Man-chi.

On Wednesday, Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Siu-chee said there was no proof tear gas posed any health risk and police could not disclose its composition due to its “sensitive nature”.  But the government’s reluctance to publicly divulge the information has led to speculation over whether tear gas could release toxic gases as it burns, including dioxins and cyanide, particularly after a Stand News reporter was diagnosed with chloracne, a skin condition caused by dioxins. Stand News Is tear gas in Hong Kong making polluted city take a toxic turn? 19 Nov 2019 Is tear gas in Hong Kong making polluted city take a toxic turn? 19 Nov 2019 But, Secretary for the Environment Wong Kam-sing has also dismissed the claims, saying the main sources of dioxin emissions were from burning trash, shops and cars. Protesters in Hong Kong have often set fire to trash to build roadblocks, and to shops which are thought to have links to mainland China.  Hau said the council members were not convinced by the government’s reasoning. “Tear gas only has one function, which is to disperse protesters. No matter which ingredients are used, the effect is the same, the only difference is the toxicity,” he said. “We hope the government will listen to our demand and not overreact to it. We have a responsibility to voice our concern.” In a letter to the Post, former assistant director at the Environmental Protection Department Raymond Chan Hung called on the government to test air quality in areas where tear gas had been used. “I urge the Environmental Protection Department’s principal adviser on air quality matters to deploy resources to collect samples and then analyse the composition of the tear gas emissions across Hong Kong over the past few months,” Chan wrote. Post “It should then inform the public of the results of their analysis, including how safe these chemicals are according to international standards,” he said. 	SCMP

While police could in theory continue to make arrests, they would be doing so at their own risk as the suspension was not “a source of authority for the government to continue to act in pursuance of the laws declared by the court to be invalid”, the High Court said. Lawyers acting for those arrested for wearing masks during public assemblies were also expected to deploy the court’s reasoning to fight for their clients’ release against police, “leading to even more uncertainty and chaos”, because the judgment only suspended the conclusion, the court said. It granted a temporary suspension order until November 29, by which time the government was expected to appeal against the original ruling that enacting the mask ban by invoking a colonial-era emergency law was unconstitutional. On Thursday, the Department of Justice, which argued on the government’s behalf that the ban was necessary, asked for either a longer suspension order or a validity order, which required the court to declare both the mask ban and the use of the emergency law were valid. The court rejected both requests on Friday, finding the situation was not exceptional enough to justify a validity order. A longer suspension order would “seem more likely to fuel further battles than facilitate effective functioning of the law and government”, the court said in a 21-page ruling handed down on Friday evening.  A police spokesman said the force would study the judgment without revealing if it would continue to enforce the law, but a police source said execution of the ban would be suspended for now. The decision came just days after the court’s ruling drew stern remarks from Beijing, seen by critics as a move to exert pressure on the independent judiciary.  The city is gearing up for district council elections on Sunday when riot police will be deployed to ensure the four-yearly event is free from disruptions. Online appeals have been made urging people not to wear masks that day, so that pro-democracy voters can cast ballots without any issues.  The court challenge was brought against the government by 24 pro-democracy lawmakers and activist “Long Hair” Leung Kwok-hung in early October, shortly after Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor announced she would invoke a colonial-era emergency law, which gives her far-reaching powers, to enact the mask ban. Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor  Hong Kong’s local elections on schedule despite anti-government protests Hong Kong’s local elections on schedule despite anti-government protests Hong Kong’s local elections on schedule despite anti-government protests They also ruled as unconstitutional Lam’s use of the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, invoked on the grounds of public danger, to enact the ban, which carried a maximum jail sentence of one year and a fine of HK$25,000. The ruling touched a nerve with Beijing. The following day, Zang Tiewei, spokesman of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, said only the Standing Committee had the power to decide whether Hong Kong laws complied with the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution. touched a nerve Basic Law The remark prompted critics to express fears that Beijing could issue an interpretation to override the court’s ruling. Under the Basic Law, Beijing has the right to give an interpretation which is deemed as final and binding, and while accepted by the legal fraternity, is also seen as a last resort, which if used prematurely could weaken the judiciary. Following the ruling, the Department of Justice wrote to the two judges, applying for the validity and suspension orders. On Friday, the judges formally declared the Emergency Regulations Ordinance incompatible with the Basic Law, and invalidated the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation, the mask ban. But the judges also immediately ordered such declarations to be suspended as they recognised their judgment would soon be subject to an appeal. A Department of Justice source said the appeal would be filed next week. “In view of the great public importance of the issues raised in this case, and the highly exceptional circumstances that Hong Kong is currently facing, we consider it right that we should grant a short interim suspension order,” they wrote. But before that, the judges made it clear their judgment was not intended to give any encouragement for people to wear masks in public assemblies and processions, as the department’s lawyer suggested during the hearing a day earlier. “Nothing in our judgment condones the commission of crime or violence by any person with or without face covering,” the judges said. “Nor does anything in our judgment support the illegitimate use of face covering for the purpose of concealing one’s identity while committing unlawful or violent use.” Dennis Kwok, the lawmaker who led the pro-democracy bloc in the case, said he was saddened that the mask law would remain in force for seven days. “The government should simply drop the law and the related prosecutions,” he said. A lawyer, who preferred to remain anonymous as he was involved in the case, said the suspension was of no use in practice because it lasted for just a week. The judges said a suspension order did not “provide a shield to legal liability”. With the judges’ wording, he said: “They are basically asking police to make arrests at their own risk.” Another lawyer acting for the lawmakers said those arrested during the suspension would still be eligible to take civil proceedings against police, when the period was over, as long as the appeal courts later upheld the ruling. Chinese University law professor Stuart Hargreaves said the suspension meant police would not be at risk of being held liable for contempt of court during the seven days. Barrister Ronny Tong Ka-wai, a member of the government’s top advisory body, said the court’s approach apparently was to let the appeal judges deal with the matter as the justice department could ask them for the orders.

Demonstrators gathered at about 12.30pm on a bridge outside Exchange Square, which houses Hong Kong’s stock exchange in the city’s financial heartland, in another round of lunchtime protests that have been staged most days over the past two weeks. Scuffles broke out after a pro-police group of about 50 people showed up about an hour later, but police arrived soon after to clear the area. During at least two altercations between some members of each group, an anti-government contingent yelled “go back to China” at their adversaries, and one of their number kicked a woman walking towards the smaller group. Police supporters responded by praising officers for protecting the city, with several adding: “We’re not afraid to come out because police will protect us.”  About 10 riot police officers arrived at around 1.35pm and urged people to leave. The police supporters left soon after, while the protesters had cleared by 2pm. A bank employee surnamed Wong, a 22-year-old who has been to nearly every lunchtime protest in Central since the latest flashmob campaign started about two weeks ago, said the government must accept the five demands, adding: “We must have universal suffrage.” A woman, 45, who gave her name as Lee, said damaging the Cross-Harbour Tunnel was not the right thing to do, but added most protesters were peaceful and did not want to disrupt traffic.  “The young people were wrong to damage the [tunnel], but if there is no noise then it’s useless. Peaceful protest is good but sometimes there needs to be disruption,” she said.

Commissioner of Police Chris Tang Ping-keung appealed to the holed-up activists after several more emerged overnight from the campus, which has been under police siege since Sunday. holed-up activists after several more emerged overnight police siege since Sunday Dozens of radicals were still believed to be holed up on the Hung Hom campus on Friday as the stand-off with police entered its sixth day. In his first public comment on the issue since taking charge of the 31,000-strong force, Chris Tang highlighted the importance of a peaceful resolution as he warned the campus was becoming increasingly dangerous. He also promised not to arrest minors or those with immediate medical needs on the spot. Those who were over 18 would be arrested straight away, he added. The chief said the force reserved the right to arrest underage protesters later. “We hope to end the matter peacefully. We have not set any deadline,” Tang said on Friday, when he visited his staff in the Police Sports and Recreation Club in Kowloon Tong.  “There are many explosives and petrol bombs inside. The conditions are deteriorating. To the people who remain inside, I think you do not want your family members, friends and visitors to be worried. “I hope you can come out as soon as possible and solve the matter peacefully.” More than 1,000 people have been arrested or had their details recorded by the police since officers besieged the campus on Sunday evening – including 300 who were under 18 years old.  1,000 people have been arrested   Dozens of protesters were estimated to remain at PolyU by Friday night, including several secondary students who were unable to be located by their principals during a visit to the campus in the morning.  In the early hours on Friday, the protesters were offered a way out by self-proclaimed medical assistants, who entered the grounds at about 12.30am after they claimed police handed them a numbered card.  These medical assistants claimed those who followed them out could go straight into an ambulance and be exempted from immediate arrest. “We just want to get people out safely without being shot or beaten by ‘Raptors’ [police’s Special Tactical Squad],” one in the group said. “We will call ambulances for them if they want to leave and they won’t be arrested by police.” ‘We would rather die than surrender’: last radicals in PolyU 21 Nov 2019 ‘We would rather die than surrender’: last radicals in PolyU 21 Nov 2019 It is understood that six of the eight people who followed the group to leave the campus were sent to the hospital. A senior police source said they allowed the group in, but added that the force had never invited first-aiders to PolyU to convince the protesters to surrender. Instead, many scholars, politicians, public figures and medical groups had approached the force, hoping to enter the premises to speak to those still inside or offer them medical assistance. “For medical volunteers, we only allowed those coming from reputable organisations to enter. We collected their personal data before they got in,” the source said. A third-year student at PolyU, who gave his name as John, said he had tried and failed on three occasions to escape through police cordons since Sunday, but would not give up. “I won’t surrender myself to police because I have already stayed here for this long. My parents are of course worried and have suggested escape routes to me before, but none of them worked,” the 21-year-old said. A protester known as “the cook” for operating the canteen and feeding his fellow protesters for the past few days, said he was prepared to be the last one to leave. “I have nothing to lose and I don’t regret coming in to serve food to people with the same ideals. I will stay until the end because I am physically strong,” he said. Dr Arisina Ma Chung-yee, president of the Public Doctors’ Association, said none of the emergency medical workers who were arrested on Sunday when they left the campus had been charged. She said at least six to seven doctors were detained in a police station for 24 hours following the arrest and were released on bail.

I think I would call it a crisis,” Mann said on Friday. Mann, who had experience working in war zones, recalled the scene when he saw a group of emergency medical workers was detained by police. “A whole team of medical emergency providers was sitting on the floor, with their hands zip-locked behind their backs,” Mann said. “I was horrified.” Hong Kong protests: bitter stand-off inside Polytechnic University continues 20 Nov 2019 Hong Kong protests: bitter stand-off inside Polytechnic University continues 20 Nov 2019 “How could your emergency medical providers be arrested and handcuffed and obstructed from providing care the society so badly needed?” he said.

In his article published in medical journal The Lancet on Thursday, Mann wrote the actions of Hong Kong police “have fallen far below accepted international norms for the handling of volunteer emergency medical [service] providers”. The Lancet “The arrest of these personnel is almost unheard of in civilised countries and is incompatible with the compact of humanitarianism,” he wrote. Dr Arisina Ma Chung-yee, president of the Public Doctors’ Association, said none of the emergency medical workers who were arrested on Sunday had been charged yet.

Post The police force will be on “maximum reserve” mode to thwart any disruptions or violence but maintain a “minimum presence” to avoid sowing fear among voters as they cast their ballots at the more than 600 polling stations for the district council elections. district council elections A senior police source said that to enable such tight security, almost all officers in the 31,000-strong force, regardless of which division they are attached to, have to report for duty on election day, with 3,000 riot control officers and crime investigators on standby. “On top of security guards, there are also armed police officers in riot control uniform and gear in every polling station. District officers will patrol their own area and handle any disturbance first,” the source said. Another source said plain-clothes officers would be equipped with anti-stab vests and anti-slash neck protectors, in the wake of a series of attacks on police. He stressed, however, that to avoid voters worrying, the force’s presence around polling stations would be minimised but with enough officers on standby in the vicinity.  Alongside the security preparations, a number of candidates contesting the 452 seats up for grabs are also taking additional precautions such as blurring their supporters’ pictures on their social media accounts, not going out too late at night to canvass for support and keeping gatherings low-key.

Compared to its previous rallies, the event was a more muted gathering of mainly candidates, party veterans and core supporters, but not the bigger group of pro-Beijingers from the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference. “It was on a smaller scale, as we are wary of ‘attacks’ from protesters,” a party management official said. “We quickly wrapped it up in 30 minutes as there were messages in the Telegram channels that protesters might come over.” But in the half-hour, DAB chief Starry Lee Wai-king and some candidates kicked black soccer balls, to symbolise the throwing out of black-clad protesters. The “black force” needed to be kicked out to rid the city of violence and allow people to express their views freely and to go back to work and school, Lee said.

A former Conservative Party chairman has joined the call for Johnson, who now leads the party, to correct the “historic error” of not giving BN(O) holders full citizenship, while the Liberal Democrats became the first major party to support in their election manifesto a “right of abode” for these Hongkongers. BN(O) passports are travel documents that the British government granted only to Hongkongers born before the 1997 handover. As they do not entail the right to live and work in Britain, there have been calls to upgrade BN(O)s to full citizenship status amid the protests and increasingly violent clashes with police in Hong Kong since June. The British government has been studying what possible changes could be made but the parliamentary election has added difficulty to an already complex and sensitive matter, which may weigh directly on Britain-China relations, several sources say. What is a British National (Overseas) passport and what is a holder entitled to? 1 Aug 2018 What is a British National (Overseas) passport and what is a holder entitled to? 1 Aug 2018 The debate brought another layer of diplomatic pressure facing Hong Kong’s embattled government, after the US Senate this week passed a bill supporting Hong Kong democracy. That bill, also passed by the US House of Representatives, has been sent to the White House and awaits President Donald Trump’s signature to become law.  The letter sent to Johnson on Thursday was signed by eight parliamentarians, including a number of prominent political figures in the House of Lords, among them Norman Tebbit, a former chairman of the prime minister’s own Conservative Party. “The BN(O) passports were a historic error. Unlike in other colonies, the UK unilaterally revoked the residency rights of all Hongkongers without consulting them. This included people who fought in the British army and who served in the police force,” the letter stated.  “We hope you act boldly to take this important decision before it is too late.” Why some Hongkongers are taking a fresh look at their British National (Overseas) passports Why some Hongkongers are taking a fresh look at their British National (Overseas) passports Why some Hongkongers are taking a fresh look at their British National (Overseas) passports Others from Parliament’s upper house who signed the letter included Archie Hamilton and Ian McColl, former parliamentary private secretaries to the former prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major, as well as Catherine Meyer, a former British ambassador to the US.  “By increasing the rights of BN(O) passport holders, we can not only correct this historic error, but also we can provide the support that these British nationals in Hong Kong vitally need at this sensitive time,” the letter added, noting that tens of thousands of people marched outside the British consulate in Hong Kong calling for the change. According to a 2015 British government estimate, there are 3.4 million holders of BN(O)s, which Hongkongers were eligible to apply for before the 1997 handover. Those born after the handover are not eligible. UK MPs and lords sign letter seeking Commonwealth solution to Hongkongers’ plight 10 Sep 2019 UK MPs and lords sign letter seeking Commonwealth solution to Hongkongers’ plight 10 Sep 2019 Johnson has so far shied away from the topic of Hong Kong among campaign issues, which have been dominated by Brexit, the national health service and taxation. The election is to be held on December 12. In contrast, the Liberal Democrats included in their election manifesto a statement to “honour our legal and moral duty to the people of Hong Kong by reopening the British National Overseas Passport offer, extending the scheme to provide the right to abode to all holders”. The Liberal Democrats were the main winners in the European elections in London this year, fuelled by Londoners’ preference for the party’s anti-Brexit stance. But in terms of domestic elections, the party is out of a political mainstream defined by the Conservative and Labour parties. Explaining the Liberal Democrats’ support for Hongkongers, Chuka Umanna, the party’s foreign affairs spokesman, wrote in an article for the Independent on Wednesday: “The people of Hong Kong are not making unreasonable demands. They are simply calling for the promises that were made to them to be upheld – these promises enshrined in the Sino-British declaration. “The Conservatives have let down the people of Hong Kong in their hour of need.” A Liberal Democrat government would reopen the offer of BN(O) passports to Hong Kong citizens, he said, noting that around 169,000 Hong Kong residents hold active passports under this scheme. “We would also extend the BN(O) passport so it provides the right of abode. This would give Hong Kong citizens the right to live or work indefinitely in the UK without any immigration restrictions or the need for a visa,” Umanna said. UK foreign minister to raise Hong Kong protests with France and Germany 20 Nov 2019 UK foreign minister to raise Hong Kong protests with France and Germany 20 Nov 2019 There was no indication whether Thursday’s letter would have any immediate impact. In September Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, ruled out changing the status of the passports “for the moment” for fear of upsetting the balance reached in the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984, which first laid out terms for the 1997 handover. Britain, he told parliament, was seeking “not to change the status of any one part of that package, but rather to press all sides, including China, to respect the delicate balance reflected in that package”. “That is why, for the moment, we will not change or alter the status of the BN(O)s, but we will make sure that, in terms of their rights and entitlements they are entitled to expect within that status, they have our full support,” Raab said at the time.

While US President Donald Trump is not expected to veto the bill, which enjoys broad bipartisan support, even the symbolic aspects may carry an extra significance – with a high-profile signing ceremony likely to further anger the Chinese government. “The Hong Kong issue has the potential to influence the process of the trade talks. China will have to respond … if Trump signs it into law,” said one person who is familiar with the trade talks. Some sources said that in a worst-case scenario, China was willing to “fight and talk alternatively”. Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it Negotiators from both sides have yet to finalise a date and venue for the US president and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to meet to sign an interim deal after an initial plan to finalise arrangements at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile fell through when the event was cancelled. This delay has left a range of issues, from tariff reduction to intellectual property protection, still hanging in the air.  While the negotiation teams remain in contact, the Hong Kong bill has become a fresh source of tension after it passed both houses of Congress and was sent to the White House for Trump to sign. Hong Kong democracy act slanders China to a level close to madness, Foreign Minister says Hong Kong democracy act slanders China to a level close to madness, Foreign Minister says Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called the proposed legislation was US interference in China’s internal affairs and that it had shaken trust between the two nations. “Right now, the China-US relationship has reached a critical crossroads,” Wang said in a meeting with William Cohen, a former US defence secretary, in Beijing on Thursday.  “But we regret to see that some politicians in the United States are now smearing, attacking, slandering China to a level close to madness.” On Wednesday China lodged a protest over the bill with William Klein, the US diplomat responsible for political affairs at the embassy in Beijing, while Hanscom Smith, the US consul general in Hong Kong, was also summoned to a meeting with the Chinese foreign ministry commissioner Xie Feng.  The legislation requires the US government to make an annual assessment about whether Hong Kong enjoys a sufficient degree of autonomy from the mainland to justify its special economic status, for example its protection from tariffs on Chinese goods. The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce has warned that the legislation would undermine business confidence and have a negative impact on the city. Even though its passage into law would not necessarily mean US policy towards Hong Kong changes immediately, it still threatens to become another complication in the trade negotiations. China threatens ‘forceful measures’ in response to US bill on Hong Kong rights China threatens ‘forceful measures’ in response to US bill on Hong Kong rights China threatens ‘forceful measures’ in response to US bill on Hong Kong rights Scott Kennedy, a China specialist at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the two nations were already dealing with a number of areas of contention, ranging from economics and politics to social issues. He said Trump would definitely sign the law, adding: “The content of the new law wouldn’t cause any immediate changes of policy toward Hong Kong. President Trump will still have some flexibility.” But speaking on the sidelines of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Beijing, Kennedy warned: “A game-changer will be if there is a massive use of force by Chinese authorities in Hong Kong with a mounting loss of lives.” Fred Hu, founder of Primavera Capital Group, said at the same forum that US politicians were using Hong Kong as “a pawn in the epic geopolitical rivalry” with China and warned that the bill could hinder the trade talks. “It is a sheer self-serving politics on the part of the US. I don’t think they really care about what is happening in Hong Kong, partly they hope Hong Kong’s turmoil will continue,” Hu said. But former US trade representative Charlene Barshefsky told the event that she did not think Hong Kong was relevant one way or another with respect to the trade disputes between China and the US. Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng said that communication between the trade negotiators was continuing, and that China was willing to work with the US on the basis of equality and mutual respect. On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that China had invited US negotiators for face-to-face talks in Beijing, citing unnamed sources. The Wall Street Journal Donald Trump’s trade war is ‘holding gun to the head’ of US economy 19 Nov 2019 Donald Trump’s trade war is ‘holding gun to the head’ of US economy 19 Nov 2019 US officials have indicated they would be willing to meet in person but have not committed to a date, the report said, and they would be reluctant to travel for talks unless China makes it clear it will make commitments on intellectual property protection, forced technology transfers and agricultural purchases. Sources said the main point of contention was that both sides had yet to agree on how many tariffs should be removed on each other’s products and the conditions for doing so. A key concern for the US is how many tariffs on agricultural products will be removed, while one of China’s key demands is the removal of tariffs imposed in September this year. It is widely expected that the US will – if not remove – at least postpone the imposition of further tariffs scheduled to take effect on December 15. But expectations for how far any initial deal will go have been scaled back, with both sides needing more time for detailed negotiations on thorny issues such as China’s technology transfers, industrial subsidies and reform of state-owned enterprises. US-China trade negotiators in ‘constructive’ phone call 17 Nov 2019 US-China trade negotiators in ‘constructive’ phone call 17 Nov 2019 Speaking at the Bloomberg forum, Henry Kissinger, the former US secretary of state, said a mutual understanding of the history and cultural differences between China and the US was necessary to address the conflicts between the two sides, including Hong Kong. “Hong Kong is bound to be a highly emotional issue in China, being the first colony or territory that was extracted from China in the period of colonialism, so its return to China has a highly symbolic quality,” said Kissinger, who played a key role in the establishment of relations between the US and the People’s Republic. “We had problems with China, we had disagreements, but they were not part of a global struggle. This new situation is partly an impact of tech, partly the impact of different political systems, but we have lived through those before,” he said.

On Thursday night, the police siege at Polytechnic University appeared to edge closer to an end as more than 20 protesters left the campus, leaving dozens of diehards still holed up at the site where radicals and riot police clashed violently on Sunday. Since police surrounded the Hung Hom campus, which sits next to the tunnel, about 1,000 people have already walked out through checkpoints. Among them, roughly 300 were younger than 18. They had their personal information recorded by police before being allowed to go home. The others were arrested. The city’s No 2 official, Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, said the toll booths at the tunnel that connects Hung Hom to Causeway Bay had been “completely destroyed” and would have to be “almost entirely rebuilt”. It would also take time to repair the electronic equipment, he added. “But there is no reason to not resume service just because of the problems with the booths,” he said. The government could stop charging fees temporarily once it was safe to reopen the tunnel, he said. Tolls range from HK$8 to HK$30 (US$1 to US$3.84).  Only a small number of protesters responded to online calls to “paralyse” the city by disrupting road traffic and rail services on Thursday morning. In the Central business district, about 300 people gathered during lunch time at the atrium of the International Financial Centre mall to show support for those holed up inside PolyU.   A bird's-eye view of Hong Kong universities turned into fortresses during protests A bird's-eye view of Hong Kong universities turned into fortresses during protests A bird's-eye view of Hong Kong universities turned into fortresses during protests The turnout at Central was much smaller than at its peak last week, when thousands gathered on the streets for successive days.  In the evening, several hundreds staged a sit-in inside Yuen Long’s Yoho mall to mark four months since a mob of about 100 people stormed into the nearby MTR station and indiscriminately attacked people with sticks and iron rods. Protesters were angry that police took a long time to arrive, and that the attackers had fled by the time officers were on the scene. Among those present then was Martin Chan, a civil servant who has attended a protest on the 21st of every month since the attack. “I still remember how police left Yuen Long residents who were under attack and seeking help. They only reappeared 39 minutes later,” he said, adding he did not fear being arrested for taking part in an unauthorised assembly. Eve Wong, 14, was also at the sit-in but said he told his family he was out with his friends. “I just want to come here to support the movement and do my share,” he said. At about 8.45pm, a crowd of more than 100 protesters started to march from the mall onto the main roads of Yuen Long but riot police showed up soon after and urged them to keep to the pavements. Some responded by hurling abuse at the officers but nothing more came of the stand-off and protesters dispersed before 10pm. On social media, there were calls for protesters not to block roads on Sunday and the days before for fear they could be arrested and thus unable to vote. Officials have also appealed to protesters not to paralyse public transport to allow the election to take place. The elections are widely seen as a de facto referendum on the government and the results will be a gauge on the level of support enjoyed by the anti-government movement that has rocked the city for nearly six months, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. Hong Kong stocks pounded by expectations Trump will sign bill backing protesters 21 Nov 2019 Hong Kong stocks pounded by expectations Trump will sign bill backing protesters 21 Nov 2019 At PolyU, many diehard protesters were hiding from public view to rest. Some chose to sleep on the higher floors of buildings. A black-clad protester, who said he was under 18, told the South China Morning Post that he missed his home badly. South China Morning Post Under a deal reached by education figures and police, anyone younger than 18 can go home after officers record their personal information. But the police can still pursue criminal liabilities in the future. “I can’t take any chance of having my name taken,” the protester said, adding that he did not want to have a criminal record. Clean-up crews move into PolyU Clean-up crews move into PolyU Clean-up crews move into PolyU Another protester, in his early 20s, was still looking for a way to avoid capture on his seventh day at PolyU. He said he neither understood nor cared about politics before the protest movement erupted in June. But he soon realised that “nothing much can be achieved through peaceful means”. Another protester, 25, had no regrets about entering PolyU hours before police laid siege to the campus on Sunday evening. “I would have regretted not coming,” said the man, who works in the engineering industry. He had been on the protest front lines to help the injured and stressed that he had never attacked police. All he wanted was to do was to protect young people, said the man, who identifies as a Christian.

She had not suffered any major injuries but she was quite weak from exhaustion. City University’s President Way Kuo arrived at PolyU on Thursday afternoon to look for two of his students but left after failing to find them. PolyU Vice-President Alex Wai Ping-kong said he did not know how many people remained inside the campus. “We know that some of those who stayed had diarrhoea and stomach aches and were taken away by ambulances,” Wai said. He did some cleaning work at a canteen on the campus and said the poor hygiene meant no food could be served there. He disclosed that almost all laboratories had been broken into and that “dangerous chemicals” were missing. A check by the Post showed at least 20 laboratories had been ransacked. A least three stored flammable or explosive chemicals, while others stored toxic or corrosive substances. It remained unclear whether the materials had been used to make petrol bombs. Post Separately, Chinese University confirmed that its vice-chancellor, Rocky Tuan Sung-chi, had been admitted to hospital. “Professor Tuan is ill and he is taking a rest and is recovering,” a university spokesman said. The Post learned that Tuan has been at the Prince of Wales Hospital since last weekend. He was at the campus on November 12 during violent clashes between protesters and police to mediate between them. He and other leaders from the university were seen running from tear gas fired by police. Post Education minister Kevin Yeung Yun-hung said he supported schools that punished students who blocked roads and disrupted MTR services. Meanwhile, a group of social workers, including Jacky Chen Hung-sau from the Social Workers’ General Union, was planning a three-day strike next month. They urged people from other sectors to join them. Additional reporting by Cannix Yau and Ng Kang-chung Additional reporting by Cannix Yau and Ng Kang-chung 	SCMP

People’s Daily People’s Daily Another video released by the police purportedly showed Cheng at a club in Luohu district in Shenzhen and later entering a room with a woman. A report with the videos said Cheng visited the club three times over a fortnight from late July during which he had engaged in “prostitution”. “From the information provided by Luohu police, [we can see that] this was an ordinary case of patronising prostitution and this was supported by clear facts and conclusive evidence,” the report said.  “In this case, police have handled the investigation and interrogation in accordance with the law and [they] did not extract evidence [from Cheng] through torture.” Canadian consulate in Hong Kong halts mainland China visits after Simon Cheng detention 23 Aug 2019 Canadian consulate in Hong Kong halts mainland China visits after Simon Cheng detention 23 Aug 2019 Cheng, 29, was released by Shenzhen police on August 24 and later returned to Hong Kong.

However, the “confession” did not mention prostitution nor include any footage of the woman involved.  In a long statement posted on Facebook on Wednesday, Cheng gave a detailed account of how he was held for 15 days in Shenzhen and tortured.

Dixon Sing Ming, a political science professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said that the torching of Lee was also widely shared in Hong Kong when it happened but interest died down soon after, probably because of a lack of media follow-up and the continuing clashes at universities, which became battlefields last week between radicals and police. “For many people who love peace here in Hong Kong, they are very sad. However, because of a lack of follow-up news on the health condition of these men afterwards, perhaps that’s why public attention on this matter has faded,” Sing said.

Court of First Instance Justices Anderson Chow Ka-ming and Godfrey Lam Wan-ho said they would make their decision – seen as highly politically charged after their earlier ruling drew Beijing’s ire – on a later day after the Department of Justice sought to keep the law in place for now, asserting that it had been working. Barrister Benjamin Yu SC, for the justice secretary, revealed the department was poised to file an appeal as soon as the court had made a decision on the suspension. While courts in Hong Kong sometimes decide immediately after hearing the parties’ arguments, the two judges decided to reserve judgment and take time to deliberate before handing down their much-anticipated ruling. The earlier arrangement for two judges to preside over the case – as opposed to the convention of one – also highlighted the significance of the issue at stake. The two justices said they would inform the government, which is the respondent, and the 24 pro-democracy lawmakers and activist “Long Hair” Leung Kwok-hung who brought the case, when they had come to a conclusion. Beijing claim on ‘unconstitutional’ ruling could spell end of ‘one country, two systems’ 20 Nov 2019 Beijing claim on ‘unconstitutional’ ruling could spell end of ‘one country, two systems’ 20 Nov 2019 On Monday, the two judges decided that the government’s anti-mask law, implemented in October by Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, had gone beyond what was necessary to achieve the authorities’ goal to deter people from taking part in the increasingly violent anti-government protests.  They also ruled Lam’s use of a colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance, invoked on the grounds of public danger, to enact the mask ban unconstitutional. A day after the ruling, Zang Tiewei, spokesman of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC), said only the Standing Committee had the power to decide whether Hong Kong laws complied with the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution.  The remark prompted critics to express fears that Beijing could issue an interpretation to override the court’s ruling. Under the Basic Law, Beijing has the right to give an interpretation which is deemed as final and binding, and while accepted by the legal fraternity, is also seen as a last resort move that if used prematurely could weaken the judiciary. Protesters gather to mark one month since mask ban was introduced Protesters gather to mark one month since mask ban was introduced Protesters gather to mark one month since mask ban was introduced It emerged on Wednesday that the justice department had written to the judges to keep the ban and the emergency provision “valid and of legal effect” until a final verdict was reached, ahead of the hearing on Thursday.  On Thursday, Yu urged the court to take into consideration the immediate effect of striking down the ban. Hong Kong has been rocked by more than five straight months of protests, which have turned increasingly violent with radical protesters hurling petrol bombs on the streets and vandalising shops with ties to mainland China. What began as peaceful marches to oppose a now-withdrawn extradition bill have shifted focus onto allegations of police brutality. Yu said: “If there is no immediate suspension, the court effectively tells you it’s okay to wear a mask and join the protest.” Gladys Li SC, for the lawmakers, questioned how the court could allow people to be arrested, detained, and even charged over a criminal offence that fell foul of the constitution. “That in itself is a threat to the rule of law,” she said. Soon before the hearing, lawmaker Dennis Kwok Wing-hang, who led other legislators in filing the court action, said they resisted the department’s application because it would be a serious infringement of human rights to use a law already declared unconstitutional to arrest people. Law professor Stuart Hargreaves from Chinese University said seeking a suspension in such a manner “[was] rare, but not unheard of”. Anti-mask law to quell Hong Kong protests ruled unconstitutional by High Court 19 Nov 2019 Anti-mask law to quell Hong Kong protests ruled unconstitutional by High Court 19 Nov 2019 “There must be a significant danger that can only be averted by suspension,” he said, adding that it would not be afforded out of the mere courtesy to the government according to past top court rulings. Barrister Ronny Tong Ka-wah SC agreed, saying that the court would calculate what both sides would suffer if it granted the concession. Whether the damage was reversible was also vital, he said. He believed that the judges delayed their decision because they wanted to be cautious, knowing that the government would take their judgment to an appeal court for further scrutiny. Since the central government’s assertion on Tuesday, Maria Tam Wai-chu, deputy director of the Basic Law Committee, called it Beijing’s “warning shot” to urge Hong Kong’s courts not to overstep their power. Hong Kong wakes up to fourth consecutive day of protest disorder and stand-offs Hong Kong wakes up to fourth consecutive day of protest disorder and stand-offs Hong Kong wakes up to fourth consecutive day of protest disorder and stand-offs Legal experts in the city, including the Bar Association, said it had been a well-established practice for Hong Kong judges to deal with cases involving the Basic Law. Former chief justice Andrew Li Kwok-nang called Zang’s remarks “surprising and alarming”. The Law Society joined the chorus on Thursday. “Nothing should be said or done that will undermine, or will be perceived to undermine, judicial independence and the rule of law in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,” it said in a statement. Law professor Jerome Cohen, who heads the US-Asia Law Institute at New York University, said: “This view seems plainly contrary to the system established under Article 158 of the Basic Law, which contemplates the possible consideration of constitutional questions by the Hong Kong courts prior to final determination by the NPCSC, as has occurred previously.” But he doubted the suggestions Beijing intended to deprive the city’s courts the power to rule on constitutional cases once and for all. “The NPCSC is likely to content itself with invalidating the Hong Kong court decision without denying Hong Kong courts the right to have made it,” Cohen said. By Friday morning, lawyers involved in the case said the court was yet to contact them regarding the handing down of the judgment. One of the lawyers expected the decision to come that day, after the judges said they would give “short notice”. The judiciary website did not give the cases's latest status. Under established procedures, the secretary for justice, whose representatives had indicated they would appeal as soon as the court reached a decision on the suspension of its earlier ruling, can then take the case to the Court of Appeal. Whether it will be expedited is in the hands of the court, which will look at the urgency of the matter, the court’s availability and lawyers’ diaries. Should there be a further appeal to the top court, the losing party requires either permission from the Court of Appeal or directly from the Court of Final Appeal, which is only granted in a case involving “reasonably arguable” merits. There is a “leapfrog procedure” that allows a party to take its first appeal directly to the Court of Final Appeal. But the lawyers, who preferred not be named as they were involved in the case, said the bypassing move would not be applicable in the present case because it involves arguments on the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution. It would only apply if appeals courts had ruled previously on the legal argument at issue. But this is the first time the constitutionality of the city’s emergency law has been challenged since Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997.

Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it “These practices have seriously poisoned the atmosphere of Sino-US relations and have impacted the mutual trust we have built over the years,” he said. The remarks came after the US House of Representatives on Wednesday approved the Senate’s version of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act – which would increase Washington’s scrutiny of Hong Kong’s autonomy – sending it to the White House for US President Donald Trump’s consideration.  Wang mentioned the act, and said its passage sent a “wrong signal to the violent criminals in Hong Kong” and would cause damage to the city. Aside from the democracy act, there are dozens of pending US bills that are aimed at countering China on multiple fronts. Meanwhile, China summoned the United States’ top envoy to Hong Kong to lodge complaints over the democracy act, Beijing’s foreign ministry said on Thursday.  Xie Feng, the foreign ministry commissioner to Hong Kong – China’s top diplomat in the city – summoned US consul general Hanscom Smith on Wednesday to argue that American lawmakers’ approval of the act was an affront to the “will of the international community” and a “violation of China’s internal affairs”, Xie’s office said in a statement.

Smith, who was appointed to his role in Hong Kong in July, weeks after anti-government protests in the city began, was told that Beijing would take “resolute countermeasures” if the bill became law and that the US “would have to bear any possible consequences”.

Xie said Beijing continued to back Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, and would continue to support the Hong Kong police “in strictly enforcing the law, and the Hong Kong judiciary in holding the violent offenders accountable in accordance with the law”. The summoning of the US diplomat was the second such action taken by the Chinese government this week, after Washington’s top official for political affairs in Beijing, William Klein, was summoned in the Chinese capital over the bill’s passage through the Senate on Tuesday. was summoned After the subsequent vote in the House to send the bill to the Oval Office, the Hong Kong government said on Thursday morning that the legislation “sent the wrong message to violent protesters and would not help to lower the temperature of the situation in Hong Kong”. The Hong Kong government called on the US government to prevent the legislation becoming law, and decried what it called Washington’s efforts to “interfere in Hong Kong’s internal affairs”. Beijing vows to retaliate after US’ Hong Kong democracy bill moves ahead 27 Sep 2019 Beijing vows to retaliate after US’ Hong Kong democracy bill moves ahead 27 Sep 2019 After the summoning of the diplomats, a US State Department spokesman said the US government “[continued] to urge Beijing to honour the commitments it made in the Sino-British Joint Declaration”, referring to the 1984 agreement on Hong Kong’s handover to China. Both Beijing and Hong Kong have characterised the US legislation as a violation of Chinese sovereignty, even though the bill only dictates US policy towards Hong Kong and claims no authority over how either the mainland or Hong Kong government chooses to govern. Following the act’s successful passage through both chambers of Congress, Trump is now obliged to approve or disapprove it within 10 days. A presidential veto could be overruled by a two-thirds majority of lawmakers – all but certain to be achievable, given the overwhelming support for the bill. A former White House official under Trump said this week that Trump would be “crucified” if he chose not to sign the bill into law, and said they expected the president to opt for a closed-door signing away from the cameras, to try to keep attention to a minimum. Trump, whose administration is locked in talks with Beijing aimed at resolving a 16-month trade war, had called on his allies in the Senate to stall the legislation’s progression through Congress, the﻿ South China Morning Post previously reported. trade war South China Morning Post Additional reporting by Finbarr Bermingham and Minnie Chan Additional reporting by Finbarr Bermingham and Minnie Chan 	SCMP

Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said on Thursday the toll booths in Hung Hom had been “completely destroyed” and they had to be “almost entirely rebuilt”. It would also take time to repair the electronic equipment, he added. “But there is no reason to not resume services at the Cross-Harbour Tunnel just because of the problems with the booths,” Cheung said.

Tolls range from HK$8 (US$1) to HK$30. The Hung Hom end of the tunnel sits next to Polytechnic University, where violent clashes between radical protesters and riot police took place on Sunday.  The radicals built barricades on roads in a bid to stop police from entering the campus. They hurled many petrol bombs while police responded with tear gas and water cannons. Radicals also torched the tunnel, which runs from Hung Hom to Causeway Bay, to paralyse traffic. Dozens of protesters were believed to still be inside the campus on Thursday. About 1,000 people had walked out of the campus through police checkpoints as of Thursday afternoon. Around 300 were aged 18 or under and had their personal information recorded by police before being allowed home. through police checkpoints  The rest were arrested.  Cheung said the roads leading to the tunnel on the Hung Hom side were badly damaged and needed to be repaired. “We understand the public very much hopes the tunnel will be reopened as soon as possible,” Cheung said, adding that he also hoped it could happen soon. Earlier on Thursday, the Transport Department said the tunnel could not reopen soon because of the damage to its facilities. It would take the government about two days to collect evidence of the vandalism to the tunnel’s traffic control system before repairs could begin, the department said. Free ferry services running between Hung Hom and Wan Chai, and Kowloon City and Wan Chai have been specially arranged. The city returned to relative calm on Thursday, just three days ahead of the scheduled district council elections. 	SCMP

On Thursday, organiser ESL announced the cancellation of the Fear and Dreams shows, which were scheduled to run from December 9 to January 7 at the Hong Kong Coliseum, in front of an estimated total of 200,000 fans. Fear and Dreams “In view of recent happenings and after due consideration, we cannot predict and promise the safety of our audience and the traffic conditions in the course of our 25 shows commencing in two weeks’ time,” a notice posted by the company on its Facebook page read. “This is a most difficult decision for us. In addition to the losses in time, efforts and costs, we have to bear the disappointment of nearly 200,000 audience members and our performers.” The cancellation came after the postponement of Taiwanese pop singer Jay Chou’s concert at Hong Kong Disneyland in December and the cancellation of the city’s biggest annual music and arts festival Clockenflap, which was originally scheduled to take place from Friday to Sunday. Chan’s concert was scheduled to be his first large-scale concert in the city since his last Coliseum concert six years ago. ESL said it could not promise to reschedule at a later date, “due to the vast number of audience affected, complexity of securing the performance venue and coordinating the availability of the cast and crew”.  The collection of tickets bought online would be cancelled and the arrangement for refunds announced on December 18, it added. In the hour after the announcement, Facebook posts posed by the organiser and Chan attracted more than 1,000 comments in total.      One user added: “I thought Eason’s concert could help relieve the recent frustration. Although I’m disappointed, I support the decision. I hope when Hong Kong restarts, I can be lucky enough again to watch your concert. Hong Kong, add oil!”  Another user wrote: “I don’t mind the cancellation. May light reshine on Hong Kong.

Hold the government, the origin of the bane of the city, accountable!” Top Hong Kong music festival Clockenflap cancelled as protests intensify 15 Nov 2019 Top Hong Kong music festival Clockenflap cancelled as protests intensify 15 Nov 2019 Others were anxious to see the concert rescheduled. “Can I use the ticket next time? I can watch after Hong Kong is liberated. I don’t mind waiting,” a user wrote. “It took me three hours to make calls for the ticket. Now it’s cancelled. I’m really disappointed.” The wave of event cancellations comes as the protests, triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, show no sign of waning. Last week, protesters ground the city’s transport system to a standstill by disrupting the rail network and blocking major throughways and tunnels.

According to latest figures from the MTR Corporation, domestic ridership was just over 108 million for October, down 25.5 per cent﻿ on October last year and a new low since April 2012. Former rail boss Michael Tien Puk-sun predicted the figures could signal a big drop in profits for the year at the majority-government-owned company. The Airport Express recorded the biggest drop in customer numbers, its patronage figures for the month plunging by 43 per cent year on year to 916,000.    The high-speed rail link to Guangzhou was the second-hardest hit, traveller numbers tumbling 35 per cent from a year ago, to 1.06 million. But that figure was 14 per cent up on September’s 936,000, the lowest monthly figure since the link’s debut a year ago. The downward trend was also evident on other cross-border MTR services, passenger numbers for October falling 26 per cent to 7.18 million from a year ago.  The grim figures came amid escalating protest woes for the MTR Corp, which in late August became a target of radical protesters, who accuse it of bowing to Beijing and colluding with police. Angry protesters have trashed its stations, set fire to and thrown petrol bombs at entrances, spray-painted graffiti on walls, and hurled objects onto tracks. It has also closed stations when protests are happening, or are scheduled to happen, nearby. ‘Repairs of University station will be similar to rebuilding it entirely’ 18 Nov 2019 ‘Repairs of University station will be similar to rebuilding it entirely’ 18 Nov 2019 On October 5 when the government’s mask ban took effect, rampaging mobs forced a shutdown of the entire network for the first time in its 40-year history. For almost the entire month of October, the rail giant closed its stations early each day, saying that was to allow time to fix damaged facilities.  Lawmaker Tien, also former chairman of the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, said he predicted the MTR Corp would suffer a big drop in net profits this year, but he was still positive about its long-term development.   He pointed out that the government was likely to grant the MTR Corp development rights, instead of operation rights, on future rail projects such as the Tuen Mun South extension, so the rail operator was guaranteed to be profitable in the long run. The MTR services have become very unpredictable and commuters have started to rely on other modes of public transport, such as bus or ferry Quentin Cheng, Public Transport Research Team Quentin Cheng Hin-kei, spokesman for the Public Transport Research Team, a commuter concern group, said the sharp fall in the overall ridership was expected as the rail company had to close train services early for almost all of October, a move he called a “de facto curfew” on the city to discourage protesters. “This is expected as the MTR services have become very unpredictable and commuters have started to rely on other modes of public transport, such as bus or ferry. We’ve seen other transport operators, such as those of buses and minibuses, have been working hard to provide services for passengers,” he said. He also said the drastic plunge in patronage on the Airport Express came as no surprise as – apart from the sharp drop in visitors to the city – the rail service often skipped Kowloon and Tsing Yi stations at night and during weekends. Check-in services at Kowloon station were also suspended on many occasions. “People living in those areas and wanting to go to the airport will choose to take public buses to the airport,” he said. As of October 29, radical protesters had extensively damaged 85 of 94 MTR stations and 60 of 68 light-rail stops, setting fires, smashing equipment and ripping out fixtures. More than 1,600 turnstiles, 960 ticketing and add-value machines, 1,100 surveillance cameras, 125 lifts and escalators, 1,060 glass panel walls and 130 sets of roller shutters were vandalised. In the latest development, the MTR Corp said damage to University station last week was so severe that it would require works on a scale similar to rebuilding the whole station. 	SCMP

The lawyer of the Form Two pupil asked the court to give the minor a second chance, saying he was remorseful since being charged and only acted on impulse at the time of the offences, which involved spraying obscene graffiti. The student, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted two counts of criminal damage at West Kowloon Magistrates’ Court for vandalising Mong Kok Police Station and an exit at Prince Edward MTR station on October 3. In mitigation, his lawyer told magistrate Edward Wong Ching-yu the boy was so remorseful he only left his home to attend school after his arrest, and had not played basketball or practised dragon dance since. had not played basketball or practised dragon dance since. “He knows he made a serious mistake,” said defence counsel Jacqueline Lam, who asked the court to pass a sentence that would not leave someone so young with a criminal record. “It has been an important lesson to him, as he was detained overnight at a police station after arrest.”  But Wong reserved the option to impose a probation order, where the boy would be under the counselling and supervision of a probation officer for up to three years. The order would leave him with a criminal record. Wong also called for a social welfare report to assess his suitability for a protection order, where he would be under the custody of a guardian appointed by the Social Welfare Department.  The boy will be sentenced on December 19.   Prosecutors said a police officer in plain clothing saw the masked defendant spray the words – “damn rogue cops”, alongside an obscenity about their families – using black paint on the wall of Mong Kok Police Station, at 7.30pm on October 3.  The officer followed the boy to Prince Edward MTR station, where the minor sprayed “divine annihilation, free HK” on the wall of exit B1. The boy was traced to his residence by the officer, who waited outside until 7am the following day, when the boy went to school in uniform.

Lam submitted seven mitigation letters written by members of the boy’s family, as well as teachers. She said the boy’s parents were divorced and he had been taken care of by his 75-year-old grandmother since he was small, sometimes helping her wash dishes and take her medication.

He had not been able to think rationally and acted impulsively at the time of the offences, according to the lawyer. “I ask the court to give him a chance. After all he’s just 12 years of age,” Lam added. 	SCMP

The camp has been under severe pressure ever since it supported the now-withdrawn extradition bill that sparked the current social unrest. Even though it backed the government on the eventual expunging of the legislation, it has not recovered its fortunes as the anti-government protests continued unabated over the past five months. now-withdrawn extradition bill the anti-government protests Gu said: “This is not the first time the pro-establishment camp suffered a major defeat in district council elections.” Night clashes around Hong Kong Polytechnic University Night clashes around Hong Kong Polytechnic University Night clashes around Hong Kong Polytechnic University In 2003, district council elections were held four months after 500,000 people took to the streets to oppose the proposed national security legislation, more popularly named the Article 23 bill. In that round, the pro-establishment parties suffered a humiliating defeat. Hong Kong’s festering social unrest has entered its 24th week with no end in sight and the city remains on edge following a week of especially violent protests that saw several campuses transformed into battlefields as protesters churned out petrol bombs and shot flaming arrows while police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. Hong Kong elections hinge on ‘return to peace’, People’s Daily says 12 Nov 2019 Hong Kong elections hinge on ‘return to peace’, People’s Daily says 12 Nov 2019 Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Alice Mak Mei-kuen, who is seeking re-election as a district councillor in Wai Ying constituency in Tsing Yi, said she hoped the elections could be held as scheduled. “We have been facing huge difficulties during the election campaign. We really don’t want the elections to be postponed,” she said. Mak, whose district offices were attacked several times in recent months, urged the government to ensure a safe environment for the elections. Peaceful demonstrators and the people in command behind the scene have publicly called for a stop to violent actions to make way for district council elections. This deals a serious blow to the morale of radical protesters. Leung Chun-ying on Facebook Local authorities formed a crisis management committee last month to determine the fate of the polls. Headed by Electoral Affairs Commission chairman Barnabas Fung Wah, the team would recommend to the chief executive that the polls be postponed if affected by a “riot, open violence or any danger to public health or safety”. Patrick Nip, a member of the committee, said the group held a meeting on Wednesday and would draw up contingency plans for the day. The government previously told lawmakers that if the election was postponed, it would be moved to the following Sunday. Under the District Councils Ordinance, the polls can only be postponed for 14 days. Nearly 70 per cent of Hongkongers oppose poll delays despite unrest, survey finds 6 Nov 2019 Nearly 70 per cent of Hongkongers oppose poll delays despite unrest, survey finds 6 Nov 2019 The commission is empowered to postpone elections or vote counting for a week should there be any violence affecting the safety of voters that could not be resolved with a 90-minute suspension. “The government very much hopes to hold the elections as scheduled on Sunday,” Nip said. “All residents have the responsibility to ensure this can be conducted in a peaceful and orderly manner.” “We don’t want to postpone the elections unless we are really forced to do so,” he added. A full-page advertisement calling on Hong Kong people to “use the ballots in your hands and don’t let Hong Kong perish because of violence”, was published on the front pages of seven Chinese-language newspapers on Wednesday. The ad was placed by “a group of residents who love Hong Kong”. In a post on his Facebook page on Tuesday night, former chief executive Leung Chun-ying suggested there appeared to be a split in the movement as peaceful demonstrators were dispensing with radical protesters, treating them as disposable allies. “Peaceful demonstrators and the people in command behind the scene have publicly called for a stop to violent actions to make way for district council elections. This deals a serious blow to the morale of radical protesters,” he wrote. Protesters meanwhile seem to be urging one another to vote. The Reddit-like site LIHKG that acts as a virtual messaging board has been carrying posters on how one must vote early, encourage family members to go to the polls, and not wear black and surgical masks.

They hoped the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, passed swiftly by the US Senate with bipartisan support on Tuesday, will be signed into law soon by President Donald Trump. will be signed into law soon by President Donald Trump Beijing hit back instantly at the passage of the bill, summoning a senior US diplomat and telling the US to keep its hands off China’s internal affairs, warning of retaliation if Trump gives it the green light. Hong Kong commerce minister Edward Yau Tang-wah called it “unwarranted and unnecessary”, saying the bill “adds fuel to the fire”. Beijing hit back instantly at the passage of the bill There are now two versions of the bill, the first passed by the US House of Representatives, and the second by the Senate. The differences have to be reconciled before it goes to Trump. But pro-democracy activists were already cheering on Wednesday, speaking ahead of the US House of Representatives approving the Senate’s version of legislation.

Ng, a US lawyer and convenor of the Progressive Lawyers Group, which advocates the rule of law, said the bill stipulated that visa applicants who had been arrested or convicted for their roles in protests would not be denied a US visa, contrary to the existing arrangement.  It will also place Hong Kong government officials, police officers and their family members under scrutiny and deter them from acting with impunity.

The pro-establishment Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong condemned the new law, saying what Hong Kong is facing is not a human rights and democracy issue, accusing American lawmakers of “turning black into white”. Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University US lawmakers regard the bill as crucial in holding Chinese and Hong Kong government officials responsible for what they perceive as the city’s eroding autonomy as well as human rights violations. China vows to retaliate if US signs Hong Kong democracy act into law 21 Nov 2019 China vows to retaliate if US signs Hong Kong democracy act into law 21 Nov 2019 If it becomes law, the US government will be required to produce an annual report, certified by the secretary of the state, declaring whether Hong Kong enjoyed enough autonomy from Beijing to retain the distinct trading status that protects it from tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese imports last year.  The bill also calls for sanctions against any individuals or entities deemed to have violated freedoms guaranteed under Hong Kong’s Basic Law, its mini-constitution.  It will have implications on the special treatment Hong Kong has enjoyed with the US since its handover from Britain to the mainland in 1997, in areas such as trade, visa applications, imports of technology and cultural exchanges. “We want the bill to pass as soon as possible,” said Joshua Wong Chi-fung, co-founder of the 2014 Occupy movement, who is facing trial for being involved in unlawful assembly and was jailed in 2017 for involvement in mass protests. “It partly means the US Consulate will consider granting visa to students who will be convicted in protests. We have seen police indiscriminately arresting protesters.” Students have played a big part in the ongoing protests, which started in June and have escalated into street violence and the occupation of university campuses. “In terms of human rights and freedom, the bill provides another layer of protection and engagement,” said legal sector lawmaker Dennis Kwok Wing-hang. “Students should be given a way out as well as options, even if they are convicted in Hong Kong due to the protests.” 	SCMP

While the recent spotlight has been on the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, there remain more than 150 other pending bills that aim to counter China on multiple fronts – from the economic to the ideological – that could wind up on Trump’s desk. The glut of anti-China legislation underscores the enthusiasm for one of the few issues that the two US political parties agree on, and one that Republicans are willing to foist upon their leader, who has been trying to wrangle a trade agreement with Beijing for more than a year. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Trump’s most important ally in Congress, helped give the Hong Kong bill – which had broad bipartisan support – the push it needed this week. Senator James Risch, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and others had publicly called on McConnell to work with him and the bill’s sponsor, Senator Marco Rubio, to move it towards passage. Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it The Kentucky Republican joined as a cosponsor of the bill on Monday as Rubio and Risch pressed for its approval. McConnell then urged Trump “not to shy away from speaking out on Hong Kong himself”. Also on Monday, he criticised Beijing for the government’s mass internment of ethnic Muslims in China’s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. Prompted by a New York Times report based on hundreds of pages of leaked Chinese Communist Party documents on the internment camps, McConnell called the system “a handbook for this Orwellian campaign to effectively erase a religious and ethnic minority in a region that is supposed to be legally distinct from the rest of China”. New York Times leaked Chinese Communist Party documents  The Chinese government has called the Uygur camps “boarding schools” and defended them as part of a campaign to root out and prevent terrorism. The Uygur Human Rights Policy Act, passed by the Senate in September, is among the many bills targeting China that might make it to Trump’s desk. Nearly identical legislation awaits passage in the House of Representatives, where it has been cosponsored by more than a quarter of the chamber, a ratio higher than what the House version of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act had before it was passed unanimously. Trump to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as Senate passes it Trump to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as Senate passes it The Uygur bill would require the US director of national intelligence to report to Congress on “security threats caused by the Chinese government's reported crackdown” on Uygurs, “the frequency with which other governments are forcibly returning Turkic Muslim refugees and asylum seekers to China, and the development or transfer of technology that facilitates mass internment and surveillance”. The Uygur bill would require the US director of national intelligence to report to Congress on “security threats caused by the Chinese government's reported crackdown” on Uygurs, “the frequency with which other governments are forcibly returning Turkic Muslim refugees and asylum seekers to China, and the development or transfer of technology that facilitates mass internment and surveillance”. Vocal support from the Senate majority leader marks an inflection point in the bipartisan drive in Congress to counter China, said Robert Sutter, a professor of practice of international affairs at George Washington University.  “McConnell's statement on China, Hong Kong and Uygurs seemed to be a big benchmark, given his reluctance to take a leading position critic of China in the past,” Sutter said. Just a day after the Senate passed the Hong Kong act, the House voted 417-1 to approve that version, officially dispatching the bill to the White House, where Trump will have 10 days to decide whether to sign or veto it.  Still before Congress are more than 150 other pieces of legislation either devoted specifically to China, such as the China Technology Transfer Control Act, or with provisions relating to it, including the National Defence Authorisation Act, which must be passed annually. Subjects of the legislation include cybersecurity, the fentanyl trade, political influence operations, trade and investment, Taiwan and the South China Sea. Like the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which could significantly threaten the trade and economic relationship Washington has with the semi-autonomous city, some bills have the potential to interrupt international trade and investment. For example, the China Technology Transfer Control Act, with versions in both the House and Senate, would require the US secretary of state and the commerce secretary to formulate a list of “national interest technologies” that could no longer be sold or transferred to China and would authorise sanctions against anyone found to have violated the order. Is the US right to cry foul about forced technology transfer in China? 14 Jan 2019 Is the US right to cry foul about forced technology transfer in China? 14 Jan 2019 “I don't think we're quite at the point of being able to make an assessment … of how much of this [legislation] is going to get passed,” said Anna Ashton, senior director of business advisory services and government affairs at the Washington-based US-China Business Council. “I do think that it's reasonable to anticipate that national security issues are going to continue to be a driving concern on the Hill and that they're going to result in legislative action that does have an impact on commerce, on US companies that are engaged in business with China,” she said. “That's an area where we're going to have to continue to try to engage in the conversation and help inform policymakers with their thinking through how to address the problems they're seeing in ways that don't inadvertently damage US interests,” Ashton added. China threatens ‘forceful measures’ in response to US bill on Hong Kong rights China threatens ‘forceful measures’ in response to US bill on Hong Kong rights China threatens ‘forceful measures’ in response to US bill on Hong Kong rights Legislation pertaining to companies with pharmaceutical supply chains in China and Chinese companies listed on capital markets in the US are among the measures that could be disruptive for businesses, she said. Still, while the pile of legislation looms, some pundits dismiss concerns that it will lead to any significant or long-lasting damage. The passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act “should not be considered as a game changer that indicates other bills about China will now have an easy time to pass,” said Arthur Kroeber, head of research at Gavekal Dragonomics, a financial services company headquartered in Hong Kong. “The reason this bill passed the Senate was mostly because it was a relatively easy thing to say yes to,” Kroeber said. “The bill asks the US government to review the status of Hong Kong, which is less substantive than some of the other bills about investment and capital, for example.” “Coming into the 2020 election year, it would become more difficult for lawmakers to organise to pass other pending bills,” he added. China remains silent as Trump repeats threat to hike tariffs 20 Nov 2019 China remains silent as Trump repeats threat to hike tariffs 20 Nov 2019 Trump has made victory in the trade war he started in July 2018 a key objective. Beijing wasted no time in threatening him with retaliation if he signs the Hong Kong Act. In a statement after passage in the Senate, the Chinese foreign ministry said Foreign Vice-Minister Ma Zhaoxu had summoned William Klein, the US embassy’s minister counsellor for political affairs. “China will take strong opposing measures, and the US has to bear all the consequences,” the statement said.

While the university grounds in Hung Hom continued to be sealed off by police with officers arresting anyone who tried to flee, the government began clearing roadblocks outside and around the Cross-Harbour Tunnel toll plaza, with plans to reopen the city’s most heavily used tunnel soon. Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University The link has been closed since last Wednesday, the longest closure in its history, after it was repeatedly blocked by radicals and its toll booths set on fire several times. After violent clashes near the area on Sunday that police called a riot, the campus has been surrounded by officers still locked in a stand-off with protesters inside. By Wednesday, 1,000 people from PolyU had been arrested or surrendered, 300 of whom were under 18 and were released after their details were recorded. Police retained the right to follow up with their cases later.  Among those arrested were two young men trying to escape by climbing down a manhole into underground sewers. They emerged outside the campus, only to find police waiting for them. They were arrested for rioting, according to police. Three men and one woman who lifted the manhole cover to help them out were also arrested for assisting a crime. Another 37 people were arrested for abseiling down a footbridge to a highway on Monday.

They will only put lives in danger. I appeal to them to put down their weapons and leave [PolyU] peacefully.”  He reiterated the government’s position that the stand-off should be resolved peacefully and in a humane manner. Clean-up crews move into PolyU Clean-up crews move into PolyU Clean-up crews move into PolyU Police’s siege of the campus and heavy firing of tear gas in the stand-off have prompted comments of concern from foreign governments and international bodies.  Rupert Colville, the UN high commissioner for human rights, was among them. But he said the extreme violence used by some protesters against police was “deeply regrettable and cannot be condoned”, while also calling for “truly inclusive dialogue” and accountability from all sides. Making an appeal to all engaging in protests to renounce and condemn the use of violence, he urged the Hong Kong government to “address the humanitarian situation of those inside [PolyU]” and facilitate a peaceful solution. PolyU president Teng Jin-guang, showing up on the campus for the second time since police surrounded it on Sunday evening, estimated there were about 100 protesters still inside, and about 20 of them were PolyU students. ‘We would rather die than surrender’: last radicals in PolyU 21 Nov 2019 ‘We would rather die than surrender’: last radicals in PolyU 21 Nov 2019 Teng said he was not aware if police had a “deadline” for their surrender. He also responded to criticism that he had not been proactively dealing with the crisis happening on his turf, saying he had been “working behind the scenes”. He said the school was concerned about the presence of chemicals on campus and the deteriorating hygiene, and would make plans for a clean-up later on. Soon after Teng spoke, a group of hundreds, led by leaders of the pro-Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, arrived in front of Hung Hom railway station with brooms, gloves and trash bags. Some marched along Hung Hom Bypass and Salisbury Road to sweep dirt and remove barricades, while others were seen taking group pictures. Earlier in the day, other protesters appeared to have scaled back their actions compared with last week. From the start of last week, protesters had disrupted MTR services and blocked roads in a bid to force a citywide strike. They mobilised people to join lunchtime protests at Central and elsewhere, which at times turned ugly with bricks thrown and tear gas fired, and engaged in tense stand-offs with police well into the night at multiple locations. lunchtime protests at Central On Wednesday morning, the MTR’s Kwun Tong, Tsuen Wan and Island lines were delayed for 15 to 20 minutes as protesters blocked train doors. But these were minor disruptions compared to the hours-long paralysis of some of the train lines last week. The three lunchtime protests, in Central, Kwun Tong, and Tai Koo, also ended quickly and without incident. Those in Central were prevented by dozens of police officers from walking onto the road as they did before, and most left the scene soon after. Some secondary school students attempted to block roads on their first day back since classes were suspended last week. Around 100 students marched from Kwun Tong MTR station and disrupted traffic at a road junction before the start of class. Another group of 50 formed a human chain outside a school in Tsuen Wan to try to stop their peers from entering. But the action ended soon after riot police arrived. Police charge couple accused of shouting profanities while man set on fire 20 Nov 2019 Police charge couple accused of shouting profanities while man set on fire 20 Nov 2019 Back at PolyU, Auxiliary Bishop Joseph Ha Chi-shing, who was allowed to enter the campus to mediate and persuade protesters to surrender, said those he met were very tired and anxious. “You can see they feel helpless and frightened. They have not decided their next move,” he said. Tom was one of them. The 23-year-old said he could not help feeling uncertain and homesick. “We tried to get what we can get our hands on,” he said. But he was not sure how many more days the supplies could last. Despite missing his family badly, he said he was not willing to surrender as he was worried how police would treat him. Another protester said there were about 40 people who would not give themselves up at all cost. Among them is a 12-year-old, he said. On Wednesday evening, the last of seven first aid workers retreated from the campus, as other medical service providers, including St John’s Ambulance, were allowed in to help, along with volunteer doctors. On LIHKG, a Reddit-like internet forum, protesters were discussing how to reach out to those in PolyU and what other actions to take. One suggested the less radical ones should stage another “singing protest” in malls near their home on Wednesday evening “to let the hard-core ones take a rest”. This sparked questions on whether it was a “right” way to support those trapped in PolyU, and if it was still safe to do so in a mall with the risk of being arrested. There was another discussion on whether the traffic disruptions and road blockage should continue on Thursday, with one asking “what’s the meaning of still doing this?” while another suggested taking a rest and “waiting for the US to plan” its move as the Senate had passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, a bill that could pave the way for diplomatic action and economic sanctions against Hong Kong. Senate had passed Ivan Choy Chi-keung, a political scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said it was hard to say whether the movement was losing momentum with the major blow at PolyU, or whether protesters would re-emerge as a united force at the district council elections on Sunday.

How many of them remain out there? And we do not know what they actually think about the district council elections – do they want to vote or not? It’s hard to say for a leaderless movement like this.” On Wednesday evening, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor posted on Facebook that she held a meeting with department heads to discuss ways to restore social order as a top priority. She also told heads of offices stationed overseas and on the mainland to help dispel rumours about the city’s situation. She did not elaborate on what the hearsay was.

The 29-year-old Hongkonger said he was now no longer in the city and in a “vulnerable position”, having received little support over the past three months.

Canadian consulate in Hong Kong halts mainland China visits for staff 23 Aug 2019 Canadian consulate in Hong Kong halts mainland China visits for staff 23 Aug 2019 While there, he said, he met the parents of a mainlander who took part in the Hong Kong protests, to “bring money back for his living cost to go through the judicial process”. He also went for a massage “for relaxation after work hours”. He returned to Hong Kong the same day by high-speed rail but on reaching the Kowloon terminal, he was stopped at the mainland checkpoint and put back on a train to Shenzhen. Over the next 15 days, he said he was moved to different locations, kept blindfolded and shackled and was beaten during questioning, and locked up alone most of the time. He said his interrogators, whom he believed were secret police, pressed him to reveal what he knew of the Hong Kong protests and especially if the British had a hand in instigating the unrest. Although Cheng was a trade officer, he was assigned overtime work to do research into the protests and send reports to his bosses. Some of his messages were sent from his smartphone and his interrogators demanded that he reveal its password. He refused initially. He said he was kept buckled to a torture chair that prevented him from moving, deprived of sleep and accused of being a British spy and secret agent. At one point, he was grabbed by the hair in an attempt to unlock his phone by facial recognition. “I was interrogated for days and days, hours after hours,” Cheng said. He also said: “I was hung [handcuffed and shackled] on a steep X-Cross doing a spread-eagled pose for hours after hours. I was forced to keep my hands up, so blood cannot be pumped up my arms. It felt extremely painful.” At another point, he said: “When the secret police took me out of the detention centre, I was handcuffed, shackled, blindfolded and hooded (so it was hard to breathe). I was not allowed to wear glasses from the very beginning, so I kept feeling dizzy and suffocated.” He said he finally revealed his phone password after being tortured. British consulate worker in Hong Kong ‘held in mainland China’ 21 Aug 2019 British consulate worker in Hong Kong ‘held in mainland China’ 21 Aug 2019 Cheng was released after signing confessions presented to him, including that he hired a prostitute. Asked by the BBC whether he paid for sex in Shenzhen, he declined to answer. In his Facebook post, he said: “I did no harm and did nothing I regret to anyone and all the people I love and cherish.” Cheng, who worked at the consulate for about two years, said he was offered seven months’ paid leave. He left Hong Kong to “a third place” for security reasons and this month, he was asked to resign. Cheng said he was speaking up now to let people know “the flawed judicial process in mainland China”. the flawed judicial process in mainland China”. Commenting on Cheng’s statement, Raab said: “We were shocked and appalled by the mistreatment he suffered while in Chinese detention, which amounts to torture.” He said he summoned Chinese Ambassador Liu Xiaoming and “made clear we expect the Chinese authorities to investigate and hold those responsible to account”. Geng said the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau had already given details of how Cheng violated China’s public security administration laws and received 15 days of administrative detention. “During the detention period, the public security agencies had guaranteed various legitimate rights of Cheng and Cheng also confessed to his illegal acts,” he said. He said he was not aware that Raab had summoned the ambassador, but said: “China resolutely opposes remarks of the British side on issues related to Hong Kong. We express our strong opposition over the wrong words and deeds of the British side on a series of issues concerning Hong Kong. The representation of the British side to the Chinese ambassador will not be accepted.” Hong Kong’s justice secretary said on Wednesday that she had no opinion on Cheng’s accusation. Hong Kong official Teresa Cheng hurt in London as protesters surround her 15 Nov 2019 Hong Kong official Teresa Cheng hurt in London as protesters surround her 15 Nov 2019 Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah, speaking to reporters at the Chinese embassy in London, said Simon Cheng should report the matter to the relevant Chinese authorities. “There are many things that are often reported and sometimes it is extremely important to gather the whole facts and veracity of it before any view is to be formed,” Teresa Cheng said when asked whether she was alarmed by the account of torture. “So I prefer to hold my opinion until I have the opportunity to collect and analyse any information that I might have,” she added. The justice secretary, who sustained a wrist injury in London last week when she was pushed to the ground by people protesting against the Hong Kong government, drew a parallel between the incident and the alleged mistreatment of Simon Cheng. Hong Kong’s secretary for justice, Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah, falls as she was surrounded by pro-democracy protesters last week in London.

Hong Kong’s constitutional and mainland affairs minister Patrick Nip Tak-kuen said that under the “one country, two systems” principle, Hong Kong citizens have to observe Chinese laws when they visit the mainland. “If a Hong Kong citizen needs help, he can provide information to us and we shall follow up with the relevant Chinese authorities,” he said. Neither the Guangdong provincial public Security Bureau nor the Shenzhen police responded to queries on Cheng’s allegations.

The request comes ahead of an expected appeal by the Department of Justice against the ruling, a legal source told the Post. Post The source said the department was also likely to defend the administration’s power to issue emergency measures at times when public safety was considered to be under threat, invoking the sweeping powers of the Emergency Regulation Ordinance. In a legal document submitted to the court on Tuesday, the Department of Justice requested that the High Court suspend the pronouncement of the anti-mask law, as derived from the Emergency Regulation Ordinance, as being unconstitutional. The court will decide how to execute the ruling on Thursday. anti-mask law, The government invoked the ordinance – last used in the British colonial era – in early October to ban facial coverings during public assemblies. The penalty for violating the mask ban is one year in jail and a HK$25,000 (US$3,187) fine. The department’s application came a day after Beijing’s top legislative affairs body slammed the ruling by the Hong Kong High Court that the anti-mask law was unconstitutional, insisting that only the national legislature has the right to decide on issues of constitutionality.  Zang Tiewei, spokesman for the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC), said that only the NPCSC could decide whether Hong Kong laws complied with the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution. He was responding to Monday’s verdict by the High Court. Two presiding High Court judges had ruled that the anti-mask law and the part of the emergency ordinance upon which its power is invoked – that the chief executive has such rights on the grounds of public danger – was unconstitutional. unconstitutional  The justice department has now asked that both measures “remain valid and of legal effect” until a final verdict is reached. Why Beijing’s angry reaction to Hong Kong High Court’s mask ban decision prompts fears it will overturn ruling 20 Nov 2019 Why Beijing’s angry reaction to Hong Kong High Court’s mask ban decision prompts fears it will overturn ruling 20 Nov 2019   As of November 14, about 632 people had been arrested for violating the mask ban, including at least 20 who were formally charged. The first two cases brought to court under the suspended law were adjourned until January. Under Hong Kong court procedures, after a law or policy is ruled unconstitutional, the government may apply to suspend the execution of the ruling to allow time for either a legislative amendment or enforcement. Pro-establishment lawmaker Priscilla Leung Mei-fun said the approach from the justice department was feasible, citing similar precedents. Simply put, the department’s move is a clear example of ‘heads I win, tails you lose’ Civic Party leader Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu But the pro-democracy lawmakers who applied for the judicial review of the ban criticised the government’s move as groundless. “Simply put, the department’s move is a clear example of ‘heads I win, tails you lose’,” said Civic Party leader Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu. “This legislation is clearly unconstitutional and should not have any legal effect. So we can’t understand what the basis is for the department to [make the request].” Human rights lawyer Mark Daly also warned that every moment the anti-mask ban was in place would infringe on Hongkongers’ civil liberties. Hongkongers’ civil liberties “I hope [the prosecutors] are not buying time for another interference in our legal system through an interpretation,” he said. “When applicants win, we often see massive delays by the government in the implementation of the victory.”    Daly was referring to Beijing’s power to interpret the Basic Law, the city’s mini constitution. China’s top legislative affairs body had denounced the ruling, saying only the national legislature had the right to decide on issues of constitutionality. denounced the ruling In a letter to Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, the British Bar Human Rights Committee of England and Wales also warned that Beijing’s remark could amount to “an encroachment on the independence of judiciary” and urged the administration to ensure that it upholds the rule of law. “The exercise of judicial power, by way of judicial review, has formed part of the judicial independence recognised within the Basic Law and should remain free from political interference,” said chairman and Queen’s Counsel Schona Jolly. Anti-mask law in Hong Kong ruled unconstitutional by High Court 19 Nov 2019 Anti-mask law in Hong Kong ruled unconstitutional by High Court 19 Nov 2019 Judges have interpreted and applied the Basic Law in many previous cases, including judicial reviews. Former chief justice Andrew Li Kwok-nang said Beijing’s remark would be “surprising and alarming” if true. The Department of Justice has distanced itself from the debate, saying it would not comment on ongoing legal proceedings. It also refused to reveal whether an appeal had been filed. It has not defended local judges’ power to conduct constitutional review, only saying the Basic Law guarantees judicial independence and judges had agreed to uphold the Basic Law as their judicial oath.

The unprecedented arrangement saw magistrates sitting from 9.30am until 12.40am the following morning, while lawyers, reporters and the families, friends and supporters of the defendants moved between courts to see them, with some finding themselves in the wrong building due to miscommunication. Some 213 defendants were among the 1,100 people arrested, surrendered or had their information recorded by police at Polytechnic University in Hung Hom and its surrounding areas on Monday, a day after officers besieged the campus, trapping hundreds of protesters, volunteers and first-aiders inside. Thousands of people had gathered in areas around the university – Tsim Sha Tsui, Jordan and Yau Ma Tei – on Monday evening. Most were arrested for rioting offences which could result in a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail. A handful were also accused of possessing offensive weapons or instruments – such as petrol bombs, scissors and kerosene – fit for an unlawful purpose.  They were sent to all but one of the city’s seven lowest criminal courts, while dozens remained in hospital. At Kowloon City Court, queuing stanchions were set up outside the building, where hundreds showed up in support of the 60 defendants divided across three courtrooms.  Those who did not arrive in time for a ticket to the small courtrooms filled up the lobbies on several floors to wait for news. But it was not until 7.30pm that police brought up the first batch of defendants who were supposed to appear in the afternoon.  The 60 cases brought to Kowloon City Court consisted of 50 men and 10 women, aged between 16 and 35, accused of rioting at the junction of Nathan Road and Waterloo Road in Yau Ma Tei. Court documents revealed that many of them were students, while others were researchers, teachers, designers, salespersons, restaurant workers, businessmen and workers in the transport and construction sectors. Are Hong Kong’s universities becoming ‘weapons factories’? 16 Nov 2019 Are Hong Kong’s universities becoming ‘weapons factories’? 16 Nov 2019 Prosecutors did not ask for plea nor did they object to the defendants’ bail, so long as they remained in Hong Kong, obeyed a travel ban and a curfew and did not set foot in the area around the location of the alleged offence. Defence counsel Hectar Pun Hei SC said one of his eight clients, Hung Chu-lung, a 21-year-old university student accused of rioting, had asked to see his lawyers and doctors for injuries he sustained during arrest, when police officers allegedly kicked his hand and struck his limbs with a baton after he had already been subdued. But Hung waited 15 hours for legal advice and never got to receive medical attention before he was brought to court, Pun said. Some 13 of another 15 people arrested at the same junction were taken to Kwun Tong Court, which granted each of them a HK$5,000 (US$638) bail with the condition that they would remain in Hong Kong, live at their reported addresses and return to the court next year. Two people did not show up as they were in hospital. Some were sent across the harbour to Eastern Court, which also saw defendants who had been arrested outside Diocesan Girls’ School on Gascoigne Road. How Hong Kong radicals got boxed in by police at PolyU 19 Nov 2019 How Hong Kong radicals got boxed in by police at PolyU 19 Nov 2019 At West Kowloon Court, where 80 people faced rioting charges in four separate cases, some 100 supporters crowded a floor outside two courtrooms as they were not allowed inside and could only watch a live broadcast in the concourse. All seats in the public gallery of the courtrooms had been reserved for the defendants’ families and members of the press. Another 100 supporters queued on a lower floor waiting to hear the results of the first round of hearings, which had yet to start as of print time. The Judiciary declined to comment on why the 213 defendants were taken to different courts though they were all from the same case. 	SCMP

The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act breezed through the Senate on Tuesday night, with many members racing to co-sponsor the bill at the last minute. Former officials described the legislation as “symbolic” and pointed out that many of its powers – including the abilities to suspend the city’s preferential economic status and to sanction officials – already exist in US law. However, its rapid passage and the bipartisan support it enjoys are seen as a sign of how high feelings are running in Washington. China threatens ‘forceful measures’ in response to US bill on Hong Kong rights China threatens ‘forceful measures’ in response to US bill on Hong Kong rights China threatens ‘forceful measures’ in response to US bill on Hong Kong rights “The speed with which the bill has moved reflects a growing concern about the direction of where Hong Kong is going,” said Kenneth Jarrett, former deputy US consul-general in Hong Kong and previously chairman of the US Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. “So for companies, that's probably the bigger focus: that the likelihood for compromise is even smaller or that there will be more violence moving forward.”  After a series of clashes in the city over the past week, more than a dozen US senators joined the bill’s supporters, which allowed it to pass without objection and marked a rare moment of bipartisan unity in an increasingly polarised Washington. Europe reluctant to do more about Hong Kong for fear of Beijing’s reaction, say diplomats 20 Nov 2019 Europe reluctant to do more about Hong Kong for fear of Beijing’s reaction, say diplomats 20 Nov 2019 A companion bill already passed the House of Representatives in October. Some discrepancies between the two versions will mean they need to be reconciled by a congressional committee before the legislation can be sent to US President Donald Trump, who must agree to sign it into law.  If enacted, the legislation – an amendment to the Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 – would require the US Secretary of State to certify annually that Hong Kong continues to enjoy sufficient autonomy to warrant special treatment by Washington on economic and trade matters.  The legislation also directs the administration to identify and sanction individuals deemed responsible for the erosion of freedoms in the city, both by denying them entry to the US and by freezing any assets they might hold in the US. It’s just Congress flexing. It’s just bravado David Zweig Protesters in Hong Kong have rallied behind the legislative effort, staging Stars and Stripes-waving demonstrations to call for American lawmakers to expedite its passage. Beijing, meanwhile, has decried the move as an example of US interference in China’s internal affairs and threatened to retaliate. Despite its broad support in Washington and the spirited reactions it has elicited across the Pacific, the bill is not substantively different to existing powers at the US administration’s disposal. Consular officials in Hong Kong already issue an annual assessment of the status of Hong Kong’s autonomy – as required by the 1992 act – which could trigger the suspension of the city’s privileged status. And though the mechanisms for sanctioning individuals do go further than the 1992 act, other pieces of legislation give the US government similar powers. For example, the Global Magnitsky Act lets Washington target individuals over human rights violations. Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as Senate passes it 21 Nov 2019 Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as Senate passes it 21 Nov 2019 “It’s just Congress flexing, it’s just bravado,” said David Zweig, director of the centre on China’s transnational relations at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. “It’s a good environment to bash [China], and maybe it makes people feel like they’re doing something. Something for democracy.” Despite its largely symbolic ramifications, the business community in Hong Kong remains apprehensive about the implications for its status as a global business centre. The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong warned of the “possible unintended, counterproductive consequences of the bill, including on American business and its ability to continue exercising a strong positive influence in support of Hong Kong’s traditional core values”. It cited the sections addressing export controls and sanctions as particular areas of concern. Hong Kong protests draw attention from US senators, Xi Jinping, activists in Brazil and London Hong Kong protests draw attention from US senators, Xi Jinping, activists in Brazil and London Hong Kong protests draw attention from US senators, Xi Jinping, activists in Brazil and London Some analysts noted that even if the bill contained no new powers, they would now be fresh in the minds of members of Congress. They also warned that growing bipartisan disaffection with China’s trade and economic practices, coupled with the coming election cycle, now made these measures more likely to be activated. “I don’t think we are at that stage, but the very idea that there could be US sanctions imposed on Hong Kong would have a major impact on the city,” said Julien Chaisse, a law professor at City University of Hong Kong. “It would bring some serious challenges to financial services in Hong Kong,” Chaisse added. Hong Kong’s Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau Tang-wah criticised the “unwarranted and unnecessary” bill and warned it was “adding fuel to the fire”. “The passage of such legislation stands a chance of sending a wrong signal about the situation in Hong Kong,” Yau said. The bill also comes amid trade talks between Washington and Beijing and, even if the two sides are able to reach an interim “phase one” agreement, many observers expect that their long-term rivalry will continue to escalate. For some, Hong Kong is ground zero in this stand-off. “The timing of this is unfortunate from Hong Kong’s point of view. We are not in a trade war – we are in the midst of a cold war, and Hong Kong is the new Berlin. We find ourselves right in the middle,” said Steve Vickers, a former head of the Royal Hong Kong Police Criminal Intelligence Bureau, who now runs a political and corporate risk consultancy. US Senate bill calls for ending sale of crowd-control munitions to Hong Kong 25 Oct 2019 US Senate bill calls for ending sale of crowd-control munitions to Hong Kong 25 Oct 2019 It remains to be seen whether the Hong Kong Act will affect trade talks, with Trump having remained largely silent about the city’s situation since sending a number of tweets earlier in the crisis. “Trump won't have a natural empathy for these types of human rights or civil liberties issues. His focus is on the trade negotiations. He sees everything through that light,” Jarrett said. A former Trump White House official, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the White House has been divided over the Hong Kong bill, with the office of Vice-President Mike Pence along with other “nationalistic figures” in the administration pushing for its progression. Trump, on the other hand, had previously lobbied his allies in the US Senate to stall the passage of the bill. But the former official said that Trump is unlikely to use his presidential veto power, since the broad support the act enjoyed among lawmakers would see Congress override any veto. “He would get crucified if he did that,” the official said. Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it Instead, Trump is more likely to sign the bill in private, away from the cameras, since a public signing ceremony “is not a good look given this moment in time” when he is trying to reach a trade deal. Close scrutiny of Trump’s handling of the bill will not be limited to within the Washington beltway. Supporters of the protests in Hong Kong have urged lawmakers in both parties to pressure Trump to ensure the bill becomes law. “The resistance in Hong Kong has been very important. Protesters have used their blood, sweat, futures or even their lives to bring about the passing of this bill,” said Zoey Leung Siu-yuk, external vice-president of the student union at Hong Kong’s Baptist University. “In light of the rapid development in the [Hong Kong] protests, I urge the two chambers to work out their differences and the president to approve it as soon as possible,” said Davin Wong, former president of Hong Kong University’s student union. But the 21-year-old also expressed concern that Hong Kong could get swept up into the trade dispute between China and the US. “I hope senators and representatives can keep an eye on the president to make sure the freedom and dignity of Hongkongers will not be traded away,” he said.

With a rising number of students being arrested, including many minors, since the protests first began in June, parents, principals and educators have urged the government to show leniency when handling cases considering the future of many young lives was at stake. Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu later softened his stance and said those under the age of 18 who left the campus would not be arrested for the time being, but that police would reserve the right to take follow-up action. Nearly 900 people had surrendered to police as of Wednesday morning, around 300 of them under 18, Lee said. Police in the evening said the figure had grown further to 1,000 with another 700 arrested. Police have surrounded the Polytechnic University campus in Hung Hom since Sunday evening, following a day of extremely violent clashes which the force termed as a riot.  “We will arrest them all for rioting. Of course, police will investigate after arrest,” Lee told reporters on Wednesday morning, referring to offences that could result in a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail. “The law is clear. Regardless of the initial objective and meaning, any assembly, if people have carried out acts that contravene or breach the peace in society in an assembly, such a gathering will be considered as [committing] the offence of rioting.”  Lee made the remarks at a media briefing in the Legislative Council, while a group of school principals were working hard to persuade protesters, especially minors, to leave the PolyU campus. “It is disappointing and shocking. It has affected our work, and our mutual trust with the students,” Li Kin-man, the principal of Salesians of Don Bosco Ng Siu Mui Secondary School said.  “We told the students we are here to accompany them to leave the campus, not to surrender to the police.” Li believed more than 30 protesters under 18 remained on the campus, with many he talked to suffering from fear and anxiety.  Worried parents complained that the city’s leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, also a mother of two, had failed to protect the youngsters. Cindy Hui, who went near the campus on Monday to find her 17-year-old son, said the parents she met there shared a thought: “If Carrie Lam’s children were inside, would the government take a hard line like this?” Hui’s son managed to escape by abseiling out on Monday night, but she was worried he would still take part in future protests. Hong Kong wakes up to fourth consecutive day of protest disorder and stand-offs Hong Kong wakes up to fourth consecutive day of protest disorder and stand-offs Hong Kong wakes up to fourth consecutive day of protest disorder and stand-offs “I told him a criminal record will limit his choices in future studies, employment and applications for immigration, but youngsters do not consider these things,” she said. “If the government does not soften its stance, more youngsters will risk their future for a fight.” Li said he was glad to hear Lee had clarified in the afternoon that minors would be released after providing their details, but he hoped the government would do much more for the younger generation. “These youngsters are not unwilling to bear the legal consequences. But the government has to study the cause and think about why they have risked bright futures by taking to the streets,” he said. Teddy Tang Chun-keung, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of the Heads of Secondary Schools, who was also inside the campus, echoed the calls for the government to take a more lenient approach. “Many in society also find it heartbreaking to see so many youngsters being arrested. The government should consider using discretionary powers if laws allow.” Legal scholar Eric Cheung Tat-ming, of the University of Hong Kong, who entered the campus on Monday persuading students to leave, said he found Lee’s remarks of “arresting all” illogical from a legal perspective. He said any arrests had to be based on reasonable grounds with evidence and some who had stayed on campus for specific purposes, such as the voluntary first aiders, should not be arrested. He added that merely being in an assembly where others were rioting did not itself constitute rioting. “If 10 people are rioting but 90 others are peacefully demonstrating, the majority are not liable for rioting unless they shouted slogans showing support for the acts of others,” he said. More than 4,400 people have so far been arrested since the protests erupted in June, of whom around 40 per cent are students. 	SCMP

Secretary for the Environment Wong Kam-sing made his comments on Wednesday, after wide discussions over whether firing of tear gas led to the emission of dioxins in the city’s air. The discussions were sparked after a frontline reporter, who frequently covered protests that were tear-gassed by police, said last week that he was diagnosed with chloracne – a skin condition linked to exposure to dioxins. But Senior Superintendent Wong Wai-shun, who claimed the amount of tear gas he had breathed in was far more than anyone, said he had not developed any chloracne at all. A scientist said the government failed to address the concerns in time, prompting the rise in speculations among people. In a Legislative Council meeting, Wong said referring to experiences from around the world that the main sources of the emission of dioxins were from burning trash and trees. Tear gas fired as radicals attempt to escape Hong Kong university 18 Nov 2019 Tear gas fired as radicals attempt to escape Hong Kong university 18 Nov 2019 “In the recent situation in Hong Kong, we could see lots of burning of shops, cars and trash. We could see the area, duration and temperature of the burning,” Wong said. “If people are concerned about dioxins, these are exactly some of the major sources.”  Wong said the Environmental Protection Department, which regularly monitored the level of dioxins in the air in the Central and Western district and Tsuen Wan, was currently collecting the samples for data this month. The result of the analysis is expected to be out in a few weeks.  “[They] have found no literature or scientific evidence on dioxin poisoning cases caused by the use of tear gas,” Chan said. What are the weapons police use on protesters, and how dangerous are they? 12 Aug 2019 What are the weapons police use on protesters, and how dangerous are they? 12 Aug 2019 Since the protests in Hong Kong broke out in June, police have fired more than 10,000 rounds of tear gas in various areas, including those with schools and health care facilities, to disperse protesters. People were worried about the health impact of the possible residue of tear gas, which prompted some schools to hire professional cleaning companies to do thorough clean-ups.  The Environmental Protection Department did not find any anomalies in the levels of particulate matter recorded at stations near areas where tear gas had been fired since June. No abnormalities were found in any water quality monitoring stations during the same period either. While there had been calls from the public to disclose the models and the detailed composition of the tear gas rounds used by police, Chan said it would be “inappropriate” to disclose the procurement details of the equipment used by the force, as that would “affect police’s operational capability”.  Professor Chan King-ming of Chinese University’s School of Life Sciences said there was no evidence suggesting tear gas would release dioxins. He said the main sources for Hongkongers taking in dioxins were from food, such as meat with higher contents of fats, milk and butter. He urged the public not to panic, but also said the government did not make concerted efforts to address the concerns of the public. “There isn’t a holistic approach to address the issue,” he said, adding concerned departments, such as the Environmental Protection Department and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, only handled issues that fell within their scopes.

Explaining the switch, he said: “Everyone knows they are bound to be spotted by police if they go in a big group.” His squad of three men and a woman tried running towards the train tracks that go all the way up to Ho Man Tin, and even considered fleeing through manholes and sewers, but nothing worked.  They almost succeeded in getting away via the tracks, but another group behind them suddenly rushed towards a main road near them, attracting the attention of police. His squad had to turn back.  “People have become wary of others,” he said. “They do not want to be tailed, for fear of having their plans ruined.” K said he could not surrender when he did not do anything that deserved being arrested for rioting. “So many of our comrades have been arrested for supporting us,” he said. “How can we face them if we just walk out of the campus and turn ourselves in?” He blamed police for locking down the PolyU campus and leaving people like him in their current state. “It is inhumane psychological warfare by police,” he said.

Lin said he and his partner refused to surrender because they did not believe they would be treated fairly by police if they were arrested. The 9.46-hectare red brick campus has been trashed after a week of being occupied by radical protesters and their supporters. Food waste, garbage, protest supplies and petrol bombs are strewn all over the place. Food supplies are running out, although it is understood the canteen still had frozen meat and instant noodles. A campus convenience store was looted, believed to be the first instance of looting over more than five months of anti-government unrest. Are Hong Kong’s universities becoming ‘weapons factories’ as claimed by police? 16 Nov 2019 Are Hong Kong’s universities becoming ‘weapons factories’ as claimed by police? 16 Nov 2019 The hygiene situation left much to be desired, with trash, food scraps and dirty dishes left everywhere in the canteen, creating a stench and discouraging people from using the kitchen. Some of those holding out were upset that so many others were persuaded by political figures and school principals to leave. “We are in a dire situation, with fewer people staying,” K said. Among those still on campus was a man, who declined to be named and insisted that he was a peaceful protester. He said surrender was not an option because he did not do anything radical. He said he only helped in the logistics of protest supplies on Sunday, and did not think he should be charged for rioting. He said he had barely slept over the past four days, staying up with some others to find a way to escape. “If I were a radical protester, I might have risked my life to flee through different high-stakes routes,” he said. “But I am not. I have not done anything. Why should I risk my life for that?” More than 400 radicals arrested as they try to escape from university campus 19 Nov 2019 More than 400 radicals arrested as they try to escape from university campus 19 Nov 2019 Edward, 22, a Chinese University accounting student who came to PolyU on Sunday, said many of those remaining had lost the spirit to fight back. He and some others even thought of calling for an ambulance to take them to hospital, to avoid being caught by police. He said they feared being treated roughly by officers, adding it would be unfair for him to be arrested for rioting, when all he did was man the cooking station. Edward added that his parents called him every day, fearful of a crackdown similar to the bloody end to student protests as in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and police have said several times that the authorities are hoping that the campus lockdown would end peacefully, as they urged those still at PolyU to come out. But a 16-year-old, in full protest gear and calling himself T-Rex, said there were about 40 hardcore radicals on campus – some as young as 12 years old – and they had pledged not to leave until everyone else was safe. “We either leave together or die together,” he said. “We would rather die than surrender.” 	SCMP

Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong have been seeking support from both America and Europe, and on Tuesday the US Senate passed a bill that could suspend the city’s special economic status and sanction officials deemed to have undermined its autonomy. the US Senate passed a bill But diplomats said that while the EU would continue to provide “political support”, it felt constrained by economic considerations. “The EU has been very unified in the statements it has made, but in reality there is little more that can be done,” said one diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Hong Kong’s district council elections must proceed as planned, European Union urges 19 Nov 2019 Hong Kong’s district council elections must proceed as planned, European Union urges 19 Nov 2019 In July the European Parliament passed a non-binding resolution that called for an independent investigation into police violence against protesters in Hong Kong. It also urged Brussels to impose export controls on Hong Kong to prevent “access to technologies used to violate basic rights”. The EU has consistently called for a de-escalation of violence and a return to dialogue, and on Monday it responded to the siege at Hong Kong Polytechnic University by saying police use of force should be “strictly proportionate” and urging all sides to exercise restraint. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was also due to discuss the situation with his German and French counterparts, Heiko Maas and Jean-Yves Le Drian, in Brussels on Wednesday. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was also due to discuss the situation with his German and French counterparts However, diplomats said Hong Kong campaigners visiting Europe were not “getting the results” they had hoped for, adding that fear of retaliation from China – which issued an angry response to the proposed US legislation – made governments and the EU reluctant to move beyond making statements.  “At the end of the day, I fear that the economic relationship with China is just too important,” one said. High-profile activists who have visited Europe in recent months include Joshua Wong Chi-fung, who met Maas and members of the German parliament in September to rally support for greater democracy in the city.   Hong Kong protester shot with live round as unrest in city enters sixth month Hong Kong protester shot with live round as unrest in city enters sixth month Hong Kong protester shot with live round as unrest in city enters sixth month Lee said that action was “simply a matter of political will”, adding that European leaders must decide whether economic ties with China trumped the human rights situation in Hong Kong.  “It depends on what their priorities are,” he said, arguing that if they were concerned “about human rights in Hong Kong, and to de-escalate the violence of the police and support Hong Kong, then they have every capacity to talk to Xi Jinping or the Chinese Communist Party about where they stand”. Lee also argued that Europe could prevent the export and maintenance of police equipment, such as the French water cannons and armoured cars being used by the city’s police. Thomas Eder, a researcher at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin, said the EU would continue to watch the use of force, particularly by the city’s police force. Xi Jinping hails Greece deals as model for Chinese cooperation with Europe 11 Nov 2019 Xi Jinping hails Greece deals as model for Chinese cooperation with Europe 11 Nov 2019 “Violent methods by protesters are a separate issue. Brussels has made it clear that it considers any violence unacceptable,” he said. “It is also clear, however, that the police are in a much stronger position looking at both resources and ability to escalate.” Eder added that while the EU could not act as a mediator it could support credible local or regional efforts to de-escalate the situation. “The main issue for Europe will be whether Hong Kong’s rule of law and protection of basic freedoms – and thus ‘one country, two systems’ – remain credible,” he said. Eder said that if Hong Kong’s economy and rule of law were no longer credible, Europe’s “more intimate relationship” with the city compared with the Chinese mainland would have to be re-evaluated – both in terms of economics but also aspects such as extradition treaties.

Chan Hoi-wan, 33, and her husband Kwong Yiu-man, 39, were on Wednesday taken to Eastern Court, where prosecutors said the victim remained unconscious in hospital. The defendants, who said they worked as clerks, were accused of “shouting in a provocative way” and inciting others to commit a breach of peace. The offence was said to have taken place on the On Chun Street footbridge connecting Ma On Shan Plaza and Ma On Shan Park on November 11. Each defendant faces one count of behaving in a disorderly manner in a public place, an offence punishable by up to 12 months in jail and a HK$5,000 (US$638) fine.  They were not required to enter a plea after Senior Court Prosecutor Tsang Siu-ling revealed that investigators needed more time to locate witnesses and video recordings, and review security footage. The prosecutor applied for an anonymity order to protect the burn victim’s identity, citing concern for his personal safety because of the sensitivity of the case.  Defence counsel Wong Hok-yan voiced objections and argued that there was a need to take into account the public’s right to know.  But Magistrate Lam Tsz-kan dismissed the challenge and issued an order for the victim to be referred to as “X” from now on. Both defendants were granted cash bail of HK$1,000 with the condition they report to police once a week, avoid the alleged offence location and return to court on January 29. A spokeswoman for the Fire Services Department said the victim had suffered second-degree burns on 44 per cent of his body, mainly his chest and arms. Police classified the case as attempted murder.

The Senate passed the bill on Tuesday, an act that could pave the way for diplomatic action and economic sanctions against Hong Kong’s government. US Senator Marco Rubio said the passage of the bill was an important step in “holding accountable those Chinese and Hong Kong government officials responsible for Hong Kong’s eroding autonomy and human rights violations”.  “The United States Senate sent a clear message to Hongkongers fighting for their long-cherished freedoms: we hear you, we continue to stand with you, and we will not stand idly by as Beijing undermines your autonomy,” Rubio said. It was the second time China had summoned a US diplomat since anti-government protests in Hong Kong began five months ago, triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to mainland China’s opaque legal system.

White House informal adviser Michael Pillsbury said the passage of the act “strengthens the range of options for President Trump because he now has to decide how precisely to implement the legislation”.  The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said it respected the Senate’s decision as “as a renewed expression of America’s fundamental interests in Hong Kong”, but warned of “possible unintended, counterproductive consequences”. Potential fallout could include harm to the ability of American businesses to “continue exercising a strong positive influence in support of Hong Kong’s traditional core values – in particular the sections addressing export controls and sanctions”, the chamber said.

Klein was summoned after foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said that any attempt by the US to interfere in China’s internal affairs would be in vain. “We call on the US side to take a clear look at the situation and take steps to stop the act from becoming a law, and stop meddling in the internal affairs of China and Hong Kong, to avoid setting a fire that would only burn itself,” Geng said. “If the US sticks to its course, China will surely take forceful measures to resolutely oppose it to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests.” Geng said the move by the Senate was a serious violation of international law and international relations norms, which China “strongly condemns and opposes”.

He said violent acts had jeopardised social order and challenged the “one country, two systems” principle under which Hong Kong retained certain freedoms and a degree of autonomy after its 1997 handover from Britain to China. The bill’s passage in the Senate came after the House of Representatives passed its version last month.

Trump will then have 10 days to sign the bill into law or veto it. Both versions of the bill would require the US government to produce an annual report, certified by the secretary of state, on whether Hong Kong had retained enough autonomy from Beijing to retain the distinct trading status that protects the city from the tariffs the US imposed on Chinese imports last year.

It said in a statement that the acts would hurt both Hong Kong and US interests. Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development of Hong Kong Edward Yau Tang-wah criticised what he called an “unwarranted and unnecessary” act for “adding fuel to the fire”. “I don’t want people to be mistaken: the unwarranted foreign intervention is adding fuel to the fire in Hong Kong,” he said. “I don’t see any possible ways to de-escalate the situation we are having. So I would urge people to refrain from meddling into the already delicate situation.” Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Several other Beijing bodies denounced the passage of the bill. Yang Guang, spokesman for the State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Beijing’s highest policy office on Hong Kong matters, expressed “strong protest and condemnation”. “Some extreme acts of violence are devastating and horrifying,” Yang said. “These facts clearly prove that the biggest risk facing Hong Kong now is violence, not the issue of ‘human rights’ and ‘democracy’. “The act by some American politicians has completely mixed up right and wrong, and is a double standard without any principle.” A statement by the central government’s liaison office in Hong Kong said violent protests in the city should not be tolerated in any civilised society, and it was wrong for US politicians to “beautify their terror acts”.

More than 1,200 US companies do business in Hong Kong, of which more than 800 are either regional offices or headquarters, attracted by the city’s free market orientation, transparent legal system and well-established rule of law, according to the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. Yuan Zheng, a US affairs specialist from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said Beijing was unlikely to take strong countermeasures against the US, but said the bill’s passage would bring harm to Hong Kong, complicating the situation in the city. “Hong Kong citizens – not the Chinese mainland – will bear the brunt of unresolved problems in the city,” Yuan said. “Both Beijing and the Hong Kong government have to rethink their approaches to do better jobs in the future.” Additional reporting by Robert Delaney, Finbarr Bermingham, Owen Churchill, Denise Tsang, and Kristin Huang Additional reporting by Robert Delaney, Finbarr Bermingham, Owen Churchill, Denise Tsang, and Kristin Huang 	SCMP

Central government officials criticised the court for failing to support the government in its efforts to end more than five months of increasingly violent social unrest. For the first time, they suggested that the city’s courts do not have the power to declare a local law invalid by checking it against the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution. China’s top legislative affairs body argued that only the national legislature had the right to decide on issues of constitutionality. Beijing’s reaction left its critics in Hong Kong fearing for the erosion of the city’s independent judiciary. They also feared that Beijing would decide to hand down its own interpretation of the Basic Law and overturn the court ruling. But members of the pro-establishment camp dismissed those concerns, saying Beijing was only reiterating its position. What are the key issues in the controversy over the court ruling? Why is the court’s decision controversial? Why is the court’s decision controversial? On October 4, after nearly four months of anti-government protests that were becoming increasingly violent, the Hong Kong government introduced a law banning the use of masks in public. It invoked the colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance, a bill which gave the chief executive far-reaching power to enact certain laws in the face of “public danger” and “emergency”. Protesters ignored the ban, but 25 pro-democracy lawmakers turned to the courts, upset that the government had implemented the law without consulting the legislature. On Monday, the High Court ruled that the law, when invoked on the grounds of public danger, was unconstitutional, and that the anti-mask law was excessive. Beijing’s view on mask law ruling ‘could spell end of one country, two systems’ 20 Nov 2019 Beijing’s view on mask law ruling ‘could spell end of one country, two systems’ 20 Nov 2019 In Beijing, Yang Guan, spokesman of the State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said the court decision had a “serious and negative sociopolitical impact”. Zang Tiewei, spokesman for the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC), Beijing’s highest legislative body, suggested that only the NPCSC had the power to declare a local law unconstitutional. He was quoted in a strongly-worded article, published on China news agency Xinhua’s website, prompting fears that the next step might be for Beijing to give its own interpretation on the present case.

The mobs occupying universities have not only hurled bricks, metal poles and corrosive acid at police, but also used large quantities of petrol bombs, bows and arrows, as well as catapults. An officer was pierced in the calf by an arrow outside Polytechnic University on Sunday. Another policeman was hit by a metal ball. The mob rained petrol bombs on police, and even set an armoured riot-control truck ablaze. When a vehicle tried ramming into a group of officers, police responded by firing a live round. Officers have been seen drawing their rifles and submachine guns. The Post was told that snipers and ground squad members from the elite group – Special Duties Unit (SDU) – have been deployed too. Post What are the weapons police use on protesters, and how dangerous are they? 12 Aug 2019 What are the weapons police use on protesters, and how dangerous are they? 12 Aug 2019 When the radicals began using bows and arrows, regional commander of Kowloon West, Michael Cheuk Hau-yip, noted that these were long-range weapons and warned them not to test police. “If we have to respond, I believe the only option will be to use deadly weapons, because arrows are lethal,” he said. On Tuesday, Senior Superintendent Wong Wai-shun said the force would rely on appropriate weapons needed to curb the violence. What weapons have police used most? What weapons have police used most? Since the protests broke out on June 9, the Post was told that police have fired at least 11,100 rounds of tear gas, more than 6,200 rubber bullets, and about 1,400 sponge grenades and beanbags rounds to disperse crowds and knock rioters down. Post  As of Sunday, police have fired 19 live rounds, hitting three students in the chest, thigh and abdomen respectively. A common sight at the front line are the 38mm-calibre Federal Riot Guns, nicknamed “bigmouth guns”, used to fire tear gas canisters. The American-made riot weapons have an effective range of up to 70 metres.  Other weapons used regularly are the pepper ball launcher Tippmann 98 Custom Platinum Basic, with a range of over 45 metres, and the Remington 870 shotgun, which can be loaded with beanbag rounds and rubber bullets.

Which seldom seen weapons with live rounds are police using now? Officers have begun drawing Colt AR-15 semi-automatic rifles at violent mobs. The American-made weapon can be loaded with 20 5.56×45mm rounds and is a standard weapon of Police Tactical Unit and Airport Security Unit officers. It can only be fired with approval, and is used as a last resort in situations which are assessed to be serious enough to be uncontrollable or result in severe casualties. The rifle has an effective firing range of 550 metres. Another weapon now being used is the Sig Sauer 516 multi-calibre assault rifle with detachable magazines that can hold 30 rounds. It features a birdcage flash hider and is used by officers from prime squads – the Counter Terrorism Response Unit and SDU.  Submachine guns are also being deployed at protest front lines now. The Heckler & Koch MP5 and Sig Sauer MPX can be loaded with up to 30 rounds per magazine, and have a firing range of 400 metres. These are standard issue for the Airport Security Unit, Railway Response Team and Emergency Unit. Night clashes around Hong Kong Polytechnic University Night clashes around Hong Kong Polytechnic University Night clashes around Hong Kong Polytechnic University Is it appropriate for the force to carry lethal weapons? Is it appropriate for the force to carry lethal weapons? Security consultant and former police superintendent Clement Lai Ka-chi, who helped set up the force’s Counter Terrorism Response Unit, said the deadliness of the weapons now being deployed depends on the type of bullets used, even for live rounds. In his view, police are responding with an “appropriate and suitable level of force” to the lethal weapons used by radicals. Although some members of the public might perceive this as police increasing their use of force, Lai said this was still far from an “extreme level” of response. He said the so-called archers in the mob were much more dangerous than armed police at the front line. “The officers underwent long hours of firearms training. But the kids? They practised archery on campus a few times, then called themselves archers and walked on the streets with their bows and arrows,” he said. Pointing out that an arrow can travel as far as 80 metres, he said it is capable of hurting passers-by or reporters at the scene, if an untrained archer missed his intended target. “Police must use appropriate firearms with a long shooting range to stop the archery. You can’t use short-range weapons such as batons, pepper spray or revolvers in this situation. But police will never order an officer to shoot to kill.” What other options do officers have? What other options do officers have? Lai advised radicals not to underestimate the force’s ability to handle the unrest just because police have been restrained so far. “Honestly, police have been very lenient,” he said. “They have a lot of options, in terms of tactics and weapons – way more than you can imagine. But they have only used the tip of the iceberg of what is available to them. The force hopes the mob will surrender and avoid mass casualties.” Although the force’s Mercedes-Benz Unimog U5000 armoured vehicle has often been seen at the front lines, it has yet to reveal its full capability – the vehicle’s exterior can be electrified to shock anyone who touches it, but this function has so far not been deployed. How embattled police are holding city back from the brink against all odds 19 Aug 2019 How embattled police are holding city back from the brink against all odds 19 Aug 2019 Lai said nobody should doubt police, especially those in the elite units, who are well-trained to deal with riots. He cited their handling of the refugee camp riots in the 1980s and 1990s as examples of their capability. He said he believed police had not unleashed the full force of what they could do, and this reflected their measured response to the protests all this time. “If the force had used in June every weapon and strategy available to it for extreme deterrence, the unrest would not have continued and developed to the current state,” Lai said.

The concerns were sparked after the Legislative Affairs Commission of China’s top legislative body, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC), on Tuesday criticised the court’s decision on the government’s mask ban against protesters, which it ruled unconstitutional. The judgment forced police to halt law enforcement while legal experts in mainland China floated the possibility of another legal interpretation by Beijing. But even before such a move is undertaken – often a fraught one criticised for weakening judicial independence – the suggestion that the High Court had no remit on determining whether a law was in accordance with the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution, set off alarm bells across the legal community. Beijing’s angry reaction to High Court mask ruling sparks concern 20 Nov 2019 Beijing’s angry reaction to High Court mask ruling sparks concern 20 Nov 2019 On Tuesday morning, Zang Tiewei, spokesman for the commission, said the court ruling “did not comply” with the city’s mini-constitution and the standing committee’s past decisions. Whether a local law is in conformity with the Basic Law “can only be judged and decided by the NPCSC, and no other organ has the right to judge or decide”, Zang said.  Lawmaker Priscilla Leung Mei-fun, also a member of the Basic Law committee, insisted Zang’s remark was not a new position, and the Standing Committee was only reiterating its position.    She said under Article 158 of the Basic Law, the Standing Committee authorised local courts to interpret the Basic Law “within the limits of the autonomy” of Hong Kong. She suggested that the Hong Kong law Zang referred to in his statement was about legislation outside the scope of the city’s autonomy and that would include the Emergency Regulations Ordinance that was invoked to pass the mask ban. For such laws, Beijing had the ultimate say, she indicated. 1 Nov 2019 1 Nov 2019 She argued thus: the emergency law covers the power of the chief executive to govern, which in turn leads to issues about the city’s constitutional structure, and therefore “it is about the central authorities’ relationship with the region”.  Seen in this context, the law fulfilled the condition for the court to seek an interpretation from the Standing Committee, she said, as it pertained to the relationship between Hong Kong and the central government.  Ronny Tong Ka-wah, an adviser on the city leader’s cabinet and a barrister, said he believed that Zang was only talking about the NPCSC’s “ultimate” power to interpret the mini-constitution. “The spokesman’s statement was not 100 per cent clear, but what he said could not change what was written under Article 158,” he said. But others were unpersuaded. Johannes Chan Man-mun, a constitutional law professor at the University of Hong Kong, said the Legislative Affairs Commission appeared to be “ill-advised” in issuing the remarks. Chan said the spokesman’s remarks were not in line with Article 158, which clearly stated that Hong Kong courts of all levels may interpret the provisions of the Basic Law that are within the limits of the city’s autonomy. “Is the commission striking down all the judicial review rulings by Hong Kong courts in the past 22 years since the handover, including the many cases that concern the protection of human rights?” Echoing the view, human rights lawyer Mark Daly said Zang’s statement, if it led to action, would be “disastrous” not only for politically charged cases but also cases concerning purely local social issues. “It would mean that people – usually the vulnerable and minorities – may not get protection for their constitutionally guaranteed human rights from courts already under threat from the misuse of interpretations,” he said. The Bar Association said Zang’s remarks were “legally incorrect”, citing arguments similar to Chan’s. It also noted that there had been no previous suggestion that the courts could not strike down unconstitutional law. Students cover faces in Hong Kong protests marking one month since mask ban 5 Nov 2019 Students cover faces in Hong Kong protests marking one month since mask ban 5 Nov 2019 “Any suggestion that the courts … cannot conduct a constitutional review circumscribes the exercise of judicial power by the courts which they have always enjoyed and is contrary to the Basic Law. It also undermines the high degree of autonomy granted to the HKSAR.” Any suggestion that Beijing should pre-empt the conclusion of the judicial process could be perceived as putting pressure on the judiciary, it said. Martin Lee Chu-ming, a Basic Law drafter, accused the commission of trying to claw back the judicial power of Hong Kong’s courts “because they think our judges do not listen to them”. He also asked: “In the NPCSC there are no judges. They have no training in the common law. So, how do they know? How do they decide? It is a very dangerous step … This could be the end of Hong Kong legal system [if this comes true].” Carrie Lam hits back at Chris Patten’s criticism of Hong Kong’s anti-mask law Carrie Lam hits back at Chris Patten’s criticism of Hong Kong’s anti-mask law Carrie Lam hits back at Chris Patten’s criticism of Hong Kong’s anti-mask law A legal scholar from the mainland, who declined to be named, also expressed doubts over whether the statement conformed with the Basic Law. “This statement does not seem to comply with Article 158 of the Basic Law,” he said. “When it comes to domestic affairs that fall within the scope of [the city’s] autonomy, Hong Kong courts have the right to explain [the Basic Law] and give its rulings.” Education chief admits apologising over mask letter to kindergartens 2 Nov 2019 Education chief admits apologising over mask letter to kindergartens 2 Nov 2019 Fu Hualing, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong, said if Beijing did follow through on the statement, it would have a huge impact on Hong Kong’s rule of law and severely weaken the city’s judicial power. According to Fu, although the courts’ power of constitutional review was not written in black and white in Hong Kong’s Basic Law, it had become an accepted practice in the city’s common law system dating back to the early 1990s, before the handover. In 1991, the Bill of Rights Ordinance took effect and gave wider protection of human rights to Hongkongers. It gave the court the power to repeal any pre-existing law that was not consistent with the ordinance.    The central government had never openly admitted that Hong Kong courts had such rights but had until now quietly accepted it, he said. Bar Association chairman Philip Dykes SC said he could already see the impact Zang’s suggestions might bring. While people seeking grievances could still sue one another, those who suffer in the hands of the government might not be able to seek redress because those court actions often rely on the court interpreting the Basic Law. Civic Party lawmaker Dennis Kwok, who represents the city’s legal sector in the Legislative Council, said Zang’s remarks were “shocking” and amounted to saying the courts had no power to adjudicate the constitutionality of even a piece of domestic legislation. “Are they saying that power is wrongly exercised? Or that power will be taken away? This will be the end of ‘one country, two systems’.” Additional reporting by Ng Kang-chung Additional reporting by Ng Kang-chung 	SCMP

Hong Kong Economic Times The city’s economy fell into a technical recession in the third quarter after more than five months of street protests that have been marked by increasingly violent confrontations between police and more radical demonstrators, including a tense stand-off between authorities and protesters at Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University in the past week. Luxury retailers, hotels and other tourism-related businesses have reported lower sales and bookings as tourists have shunned Hong Kong in droves in recent months. But the effects from the slowing economy appear to be spreading to a broader range of companies. As Hong Kong’s reporting season continues, more than a dozen companies have warned since the beginning of November that they will report a loss or see worsening profits – for the third quarter or the half-year – as a result of the city’s slowing economy. That is on top of 22 companies which cited the ongoing social unrest or weakening Hong Kong economy when issuing profit warnings in October.

The extradition bill has been formally withdrawn after months of unrest, but the demonstrations have morphed into a broader discussion over income inequality, affordable housing and Beijing’s influence over the city.  The street protests have cut foot traffic, forced shops to close early and discouraged residents from dining out, with food deliveries one of the few areas of the economy to see an uptick in recent months. Visits by mainland tourists, the biggest category of visitors to the city annually, fell by 42 per cent in August as the political crisis worsened. food deliveries one of the few areas of the economy to see an uptick Hong Kong protests deal massive blow to trade exhibitions Hong Kong protests deal massive blow to trade exhibitions Hong Kong’s Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said on Sunday that Hong Kong was on the brink of its worst recession since the 1997 handover. was on the brink of its worst recession since the 1997 handover Last month, luxury retailers Moncler and Kering, the owner of Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta, both reported double digit declines in sales at their Hong Kong stores in the third quarter. InterContinental Hotels Group, the operator of the Crowne Plaza and InterContinental hotels in Hong Kong, and spirits maker Remy Cointreau, which produces Remy Martin cognac, also have said declining tourism in Hong Kong cut into their sales and per-room revenue in the period. reported double digit declines  Kowloon-based Tse Sui Luen Jewellery (International), which issued a results warning last month, said on Tuesday its profit fell by 94 per cent to HK$1.57 million in the six months ended September 30. Banks implement staff contingency plans as protests rage 13 Oct 2019 Banks implement staff contingency plans as protests rage 13 Oct 2019 “The weak local consumer sentiment as a result of citywide protests has made it challenging for retailers to operate,” the company said in a stock exchange filing. “The hardship the local retail industry is facing is likely to persist or even worsen in the remainder of this financial year.  “Amid the difficult business environment, the group will manage the risks with effective cost saving measures in a prudent manner, and stay alert and respond to any future market changes as and when they occur.” Swire Pacific, the owner of Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific and the operator of the Pacific Place shopping centre and office building complex, said sales at its malls in Hong Kong have been hit by the protests, with rental concessions offered to some retail tenants. Swire Pacific Passenger traffic and forward bookings have been affected “adversely” at Cathay Pacific and the unrest is affecting sales at retail outlets operated by Swire Resources. As a result, Swire Pacific said its consolidated recurring underlying profit for 2019 is expected to be below 2018. its consolidated recurring underlying profit for 2019 is expected to be below 2018 “The expected results of Cathay Pacific are the principal reason for this,” Swire said in a November 7 stock exchange filing. The company said, however, its consolidated underlying profit for the year is expected to exceed 2018’s as a result of the disposal of investment properties and other one-time factors.   In recent weeks, investment companies and builders alike have joined the cavalcade of firms to warn they expected to post losses or weaker results, citing softening property values, declining sales and slower construction activity in the city. On Friday, Lippo China Resources, the property investor and operator of cafes, health care services and mineral extraction operations, said it expected to report a loss of HK$100 million for the first half of the year as a result of a fair value loss on its investment properties, “mainly due to the softening property market in Hong Kong”. Lippo is expected to report its results later this month. Silver Tide Holdings, a Kowloon construction contractor, warned on November 13 it expected to report a “substantial decrease” in profit of about 70 per cent to 80 per cent for the six months ended in September, attributing the decline in part to “an increase in subcontracting charges” because of project delays “as a result of recent social unrest in Hong Kong”. Silver Tide is expected to report its results by the end of November. Hong Kong may have lost US$4 billion to Singapore during protests: report 3 Oct 2019 Hong Kong may have lost US$4 billion to Singapore during protests: report 3 Oct 2019 Even the media has not been spared. HKET Holdings, the publisher of the Hong Kong Economic Times, said last week it expected to report a “significant decline” in its profit for the six months ended in September. Hong Kong Economic Times “Such decline is mainly attributable to the adversity in the economic and business environment, especially the advertising market, resulted from the global economic uncertainties and recent social unrest in Hong Kong,” the company said in a stock exchange filing on November 11. The company expects to report its first-half results before November 30. 	SCMP

Classes resumed at primary and secondary schools on Wednesday, with about 100 pupils in Kwun Tong marking their return by disrupting traffic at the junction of Hip Wo Street and Tsui Ping Road. Riot police arrived on the scene. Mask-wearing secondary students in their school uniforms marched from Kwun Tong MTR station to the intersection before the start of classes.

Activists issued calls on social media for protesters to “paralyse the whole of Hong Kong” on Wednesday morning.  The first trains of the day on part of the East Rail line were delayed for staff to clear several objects off the track near Fanling, including a bicycle hanging from an overhead cable. Trains skipped Yuen Long station in the morning because of protester disruption. Tactics included stopping trains leaving by blocking doorways and opening emergency doors. At Diamond Hill station, where carriage doors were not closing, more than 100 passengers were unable to board trains during the rush hour. A 58-year-old clerk at an accountancy firm in Central, who gave her name as Ms Wong, said she would be more than an hour late for work because of the delays at Diamond Hill, and feared having to take the whole day off. “I feel angry. I wanted to go to work, but there’s nothing I can do ... The [protesters] have affected our livelihood, bringing Hong Kong to a standstill,” Wong said.

Wednesday saw the return of classes at primary and secondary schools following several days of suspensions from the transport chaos caused by protesters. At Po Leung Kuk Lee Shing Pik College in Tsuen Wan, its student concern group said riot police had “entered the school premises” after arriving at the scene of a protest held outside the gates. Some 50 pupils tried to stop their peers entering the school from 7am in an attempt to “pressurise” management into suspending classes indefinitely until “society returns to normal”. Riot officers were among those who turned and were checking the identities of students, including two pupils on site, the concern group said. No one was arrested. Elsewhere, many pupils arrived early after demonstrators said they would take direct action across swathes of the city, with several saying they were glad to be back in school. Adrian, a Form Four student studying in St Paul’s College near to the University of Hong Kong, arrived at school at 7.10am, an hour early. He said it was good to be back after spending the last few days at home. Form Six student, Bill Chan, who lives in Tung Chung, said the railway service was normal for his journey to school. “It’s been a week since school closed. I am quite eager to go back for classes and meet my classmates,” he said. Over at Polytechnic University, officers continued to surround the campus in a lockdown imposed since Sunday evening after a day of extreme violence in the area which the force declared a riot. Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University According to police, about 1,100 people had been arrested or surrendered during the clashes, as of Tuesday afternoon. The PolyU campus resembled a disaster zone early on Wednesday with unused petrol bombs, cans of petroleum gas, loose bricks and protest equipment scattered across the ground, while many buildings had glass windows and doors smashed in. It is understood those on the campus were still exploring ways to escape, including via manholes. University of Hong Kong’s Vice-Chancellor Zhang Xiang made a surprise appearance at PolyU shortly after midnight. He wanted to meet HKU students stranded at the PolyU campus. But 1½ hours later, he said he could find not any of them. In a voice message to students before his arrival, the HKU leader said: “I am worried about you. Please stay safe. I want to see you again.” Among those who remained inside PolyU in the early hours of Wednesday was a Chinese University student, who said: “I want to leave, but I won’t surrender. “I might be arrested if I continue to stay here. But if I just walk out now, I will definitely [be arrested].” Another protester, Chan, said he had been searching in vain for secret passages to make good his escape since Sunday. The 24-year-old has still not told his parents he was inside PolyU because he did not want them to worry. “I have no regrets,” he said. “It’s the police’s actions on protesters [since June] that has driven us to this.” He said not everyone who remained inside the campus were frontline protesters. Some just helped cook food at the canteen while others were simply supporters, he added. The auxiliary bishop of Hong Kong, Joseph Ha Chi-shing, spent four hours at PolyU with Reverend Yuen Tin-yau until the early hours of Wednesday trying to convince protesters to leave the campus peacefully, to no avail. “They are tired. They are anxious and puzzled. They still haven’t decided their next steps,” Ha said. “We tried to listen to them and let them know our thoughts … I hope they can understand that there is still a way out of this.” By Wednesday, no first aid volunteers could be seen inside the campus. According to education sector lawmaker Ip Kin-yuen, who was inside the campus at the time, about 40 of the medical volunteers left on Tuesday night.   They were not arrested as they departed, but police told them they might face investigation in the future. Police have been calling on those inside the campus to surrender and leave the campus through police checkpoints. Those that do run the risk of being arrested for rioting offences, which can bring a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail. During the violent clashes on Sunday, radical protesters threw a large number of petrol bombs at police, who responded with tear gas and water cannons. They were some of the ugliest scenes since the anti-government protests erupted in June, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. now-withdrawn extradition bill 	SCMP

A London-based advocate for the protesters in Hong Kong said Raab should make use of his separate meetings with Heiko Maas and Jean-Yves Le Drian, the foreign ministers of Germany and France, to discuss asylum situations and to promote an independent investigation into the increasingly violent situation. The meetings will take place in Brussels on the sidelines of the Nato foreign ministers’ meeting. “The foreign secretary will also use today’s visit to separately meet with his E3 French and German counterparts to discuss shared foreign policy challenges, including … the escalation of protests in Hong Kong,” Britain’s Foreign Office said in a statement. Raab’s meetings come two days after the European Union – of which all three countries are members – urged the Hong Kong government not to delay the district council elections planned for Sunday. People familiar with his thinking said Raab considered Hong Kong and Iran his top two foreign policy issues.  Johnny Patterson, director of Hong Kong Watch, said: “With the situation in Hong Kong on a knife edge, it is vital that European leaders step up. Dominic Raab should stand with his French and German counterparts to call for an independent inquiry into the protests as this is the only viable route to a political solution.” Macron could have done more on China trip, experts say 7 Nov 2019 Macron could have done more on China trip, experts say 7 Nov 2019 Patterson said the diplomatic force of European action would be strongest if these countries acted together. “They should draw up a contingency plan if Hongkongers start seeking asylum, and should tell Beijing that the further erosion of rights and freedoms will result in the application of coordinated Magnitsky sanctions,” he said.  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government has committed to implementing a global Magnitsky Act to punish perpetrators of human rights abuses. Campaigners have called for this to be applied to Hong Kong officials. Germany has granted asylum to two Hong Kong activists, though they were not related to the protests that started in June when Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor rolled out a divisive extradition bill, which has since been withdrawn.  Maas attracted criticism from China in September when he met Joshua Wong Chi-fung, Hong Kong's leading student activist, in Berlin. Germany and France should coordinate with Britain on how to come to a unified position on Hong Kong, according to foreign policy experts in the two countries. Extra security, polling stations moved as Hong Kong readies for elections 20 Nov 2019 Extra security, polling stations moved as Hong Kong readies for elections 20 Nov 2019 The meetings “should serve to come to a common understanding about the severity of what is happening” in Hong Kong, with a joint position and “ideally one that bites a bit more beyond just stating that all sides should be restrained”, said Mikko Huotari, deputy director of the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. “Beyond statements, they should discuss: Can/should there be any effective conditionality attached to our ‘concerns’? What leverage – if at all – do we have?” Huotari said in an emailed reply. Antoine Bondaz, fellow at the Paris-based Foundation for Strategic Research, said the top priority for France would be to have a coordinated and united approach with the British. On Monday, the European Union warned the Hong Kong government not to delay the district council elections scheduled for Sunday, amid speculation about a possible postponement amid the protests. The 28-country bloc also called for police action to remain “strictly proportionate” in and around Polytechnic University, where a tense stand-off between radical protesters and police continued.

For three years, Wen had crossed the Lo Wu checkpoint into Hong Kong to take her son to kindergarten, but the months of unrest involving high school and university students prompted her to question an education system in which she once had great confidence. months of unrest The turmoil compounded concerns that her six-year-old son would be taught – in her words – “from biased textbooks and by teachers prejudiced against the Chinese mainland”. As a result, she decided to give up her son’s place at a top-ranking primary school in Tai Po and send him to a private boarding school in Shenzhen. “There are 28 years to go until 2047, when Hong Kong’s separate system ends, but how can my son wait for 28 years to finally get an objective understanding of China?” Wen said. “I am more confident in the development of Shenzhen and I think my son needs to be part of the city from the time he is young.”  Until this summer, Wen’s son – whose father is from Hong Kong – was one of nearly 30,000 children who cross the border each day from Shenzhen to go to school in neighbouring Hong Kong. The phenomenon emerged in the 1980s and continued for about two decades as cross-border marriages flourished.  Under Hong Kong regulations, children born in the city are entitled to attend Hong Kong schools, even if they live on the mainland, and the trend was seen as a sign of the city’s educational strength. Inside the occupied Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus Inside the occupied Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus Inside the occupied Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus Although there are no official figures, Chinese state media and local news outlets report that the number now making that journey has dropped since the start of the school year in September.  Observers said the decision by some mainland parents to take their children out of the Hong Kong education system was the result of a number of factors, including deep parental anxiety about growing divisions in society, concerns about the impact of those divisions on their children’s development, and questions about the values being promoted at schools. But there are also factors on the mainland pulling parents back. Meet the mainland Chinese who are living in fear in Hong Kong 8 Oct 2019 Meet the mainland Chinese who are living in fear in Hong Kong 8 Oct 2019  “Hong Kong has a different political and educational system, which in itself is not a problem, but if it deliberately instils an anti-China attitude in the next generation, then it would be unacceptable for some parents,” He said. Concerns about the effects of the protests on children were underlined by a report released in September by the Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers. In a survey of 168 schools, the federation found that more than 40 per cent of those polled reported emotional problems among students caused by the ongoing anti-government protests. Some six per cent of the schools also reported bullying among students over the issue. That month, Hong Kong’s education authority also said it received 58 complaints against teachers on protest-related issues and warned two teachers for swearing at the family members of police officers, amid accusations of police using excessive force against protesters. A kindergarten teacher was charged over an alleged assault of a three-year-old girl, whose relative is a police officer. Ropes and motorbikes used to escape Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus siege Ropes and motorbikes used to escape Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus siege Ropes and motorbikes used to escape Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus siege Federation chairman Wong Kam-leung said the protest activities organised in schools, such as boycotts and human chains, were to blame for many of the problems. “We firmly oppose the idea of bringing political demands into campuses,” he said. For Wen, the Shenzhen mother, a major contributing factor is the textbooks used for liberal studies, a compulsory course in Hong Kong’s high schools. When the protests escalated in July, Wen borrowed some of the texts from a friend to read. “The textbooks are a little too extreme – they just mention the negative sides of mainland China such as corruption and food safety, while failing to mention the leaps and bounds in improvements in the mainland. It’s a very unbalanced picture of China,” she said. Hong Kong protests: young, educated mainland Chinese are questioning their place in the city 25 Aug 2019 Hong Kong protests: young, educated mainland Chinese are questioning their place in the city 25 Aug 2019 Nevertheless, there were still some benefits to the Hong Kong system. “If we don’t look at the political factors, Hong Kong’s education is more advanced than that in mainland China,” Wen said. She said the use of experiential learning in Hong Kong’s schools helped students better recognise and gain knowledge, while schools on the mainland focused more on cognitive and technical skills. Yang Hui, a mother of two cross-border children from Shenzhen, agreed that the education in Hong Kong was good but she was still worried about political divisions in the city. “Most of the teachers have stayed politically neutral [in the schools of my children], but some of them are quite extreme, and I’m worried my son will be negatively influenced by them,” Yang said. According to a study by the Economist Intelligence Unit last year, the education system in Hong Kong was more competitive than that on the mainland. In the study of the 15-24 age group, Hong Kong ranked 15th while China came in 39th of the 50 economies examined. Schools in Hong Kong were better at fostering future-oriented skills among students, including leadership, entrepreneurship, creativity, communication, global awareness, civic education skills, as well as digital skills, the survey found. A bird's-eye view of Hong Kong universities turned into fortresses during protests A bird's-eye view of Hong Kong universities turned into fortresses during protests A bird's-eye view of Hong Kong universities turned into fortresses during protests Hong Kong is also attractive to some mainland parents struggling to get their children into schools in Shenzhen. School entry on the mainland is heavily influenced by a system of household registration known as hukou. Children without a Shenzhen hukou, including many of those born in Hong Kong, have a much lower priority on the list for school places in the border city. Shenzhen’s school system is also overstretched, with just 344 primary schools for its 13 million people compared with the 961 primary schools serving the 15 million people in Guangzhou. Li Mingqing, a mainland mother of a teenager born in Hong Kong and without a Shenzhen hukou, said studying in Shenzhen was not a choice for her son because he could not get the grades to get into a good public school. “And the positions in Shenzhen’s private and public schools are so limited,” she said. Nevertheless, analysts said the standard of education was improving on the mainland and there was more confidence in its future. Hong Kong unrest drives mainland Chinese students to look to overseas universities 15 Aug 2019 Hong Kong unrest drives mainland Chinese students to look to overseas universities 15 Aug 2019 City University professor James Sung Lap-kung, who is also a political commentator, said that while social unrest was a catalyst, multiple factors were attracting parents in general to choose schools on the mainland. “The Chinese mainland has a big job market, its education industry has improved a lot with many private and international schools setting up in the past two decades, and universities in China can offer some programmes that don’t exist in Hong Kong,” Sung said. “For some parents, sending their children to a mainland school can be both good for their own and the kids’ career development.” One 36-year-old woman, who would only be identified by her surname Shen, is among those making the move back to the mainland after more than a decade of living in Hong Kong. Shen said she would return to her hometown in Jiangsu province in eastern China with her two Hong Kong-born children, to help run the family businesses. “The past four months have made me very upset and anxious and I value the opportunity to work on the mainland,” Shen said, adding that she would enrol her two children in mainland primary schools. Hong Kong protests draw attention from US senators, Xi Jinping, activists in Brazil and London Hong Kong protests draw attention from US senators, Xi Jinping, activists in Brazil and London Hong Kong protests draw attention from US senators, Xi Jinping, activists in Brazil and London A business professor at a Hong Kong university, surnamed Wu, said he hoped that leading schools on the mainland could open branches in Hong Kong, expanding education options for parents in the city. “Model high schools in mainland China such as Beijing’s Renmin University’s affiliated high school and Changsha’s Changjun High School are hot schools and would must be highly welcomed by us mainlanders,” he said. He also said that Hong Kong students in his classes had better English than their mainland classmates but appeared to have less confidence. “To my surprise, it’s the mainland students who get into heated exchanges with students from the United States and European Union, though their English is not that fluent,” he said. “I can sense a low confidence level among the local students, who are afraid their viewpoints cannot be echoed by other classmates. And it’s no wonder given that the locals are living in a high-pressure city where basic living and even survival is a challenge.” Li Xiaobing, an associate professor at Nankai University’s law school, said the decision to opt for a mainland education reflected fears and concerns about the uncertainty confronting Hong Kong. “Education is an investment in the future, and leaving Hong Kong schools is a signal that some parents are giving up Hong Kong to embrace the mainland,” Li said. But Yang, the mother-of-two in Shenzhen, shares one hope in common with parents in Hong Kong – she wants the unrest in the city to end soon. 	SCMP

Congress’ upper chamber put the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, sponsored by Florida Republican Marco Rubio, through an expedited process that sidestepped a roll call vote, allowing the bill to pass without any objections. The Senate also passed the Protect Hong Kong Act, sponsored by Oregon Democrat Jeff Merkley, which would prohibit US companies from exporting non-lethal crowd control and defence items to the city. The House of Representatives passed that chamber’s versions of the two bills last month. China threatens ‘forceful measures’ in response to US bill on Hong Kong rights China threatens ‘forceful measures’ in response to US bill on Hong Kong rights China threatens ‘forceful measures’ in response to US bill on Hong Kong rights “The United States Senate sent a clear message to Hongkongers fighting for their long-cherished freedoms: we hear you, we continue to stand with you, and we will not stand idly by as Beijing undermines your autonomy,” Rubio announced. “The passage of this bill is an important step in holding accountable those Chinese and Hong Kong government officials responsible for Hong Kong’s eroding autonomy and human rights violations.  “Both the United States Senate and House of Representatives have now demonstrated bipartisan solidarity with the people of Hong Kong as they stand up for their freedoms and basic human rights,” Rubio added. China ‘will retaliate’ if Trump signs Congress’ Hong Kong act into law 21 Nov 2019 China ‘will retaliate’ if Trump signs Congress’ Hong Kong act into law 21 Nov 2019 The number of senators co-sponsoring the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act surged on Monday, bringing in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and showing the biggest jump since the bill was introduced in June, following a stream of reports about a violent standoff playing out since Sunday between police and radical students at Polytechnic University in Hong Kong.  Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it Donald Trump set to have final say on Hong Kong democracy act as US Senate passes it Speaking before the passage, many of the lawmakers blamed Beijing and the Hong Kong government for the cycle of violence in recent months that has culminated in the university melee.  “The people of Hong Kong are fighting for their lives,” said New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez. “Six months ago, millions of Hong Kong residents took to the streets to peacefully protest the erosion of their democracy and their rights.”  “A half a year later we find mounting anger and unrest, with the violence against student protesters, most dramatically in the crackdown at Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University only getting worse,” said Menendez, who is the most senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “People are being shot. Universities are being burned. The violence perpetrated by the authorities in Hong Kong, and by extension Beijing, are turning the city into a battlefield.” Some analysts have voiced concern about the impact passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act will have on the city.

The House and Senate versions of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act will need to go to a committee of House and Senate members to be reconciled into one unified bill that will go back to each chamber for final approvals. Trump will then have 10 days to sign the bill into law or veto it. Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University James Feinerman, a professor of Asian legal studies at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, noted that Trump’s signature is not assured, particularly if the US leader’s priority is to strike a deal with China on the trade front. “If [Trump] believes that he's made a favourable first step [with China], I think he would veto the bill,” Feinerman said. “The bill would die out without the president's signature.” Senate puts Hong Kong democracy bill on fast track as violence rises 15 Nov 2019 Senate puts Hong Kong democracy bill on fast track as violence rises 15 Nov 2019 The two versions have many of the same stipulations, including a requirement that the US government produce an annual report, certified by the Secretary of State, that Hong Kong has retained enough autonomy from China to continue the city’s distinct trading status. That distinction protects Hong Kong from the punitive tariffs Washington placed on goods from China last year. Both versions also call for sanctions against any individuals or entities deemed to have violated freedoms guaranteed under Hong Kong's Basic Law and direct the State Department to not deny visas to those subjected to “politically motivated” arrests or detention in the city. However, the Senate version goes further in terms of its objectives and stated tactics. Up to 100 activists still holed up as Hong Kong campus stand-off continues 20 Nov 2019 Up to 100 activists still holed up as Hong Kong campus stand-off continues 20 Nov 2019 For example, Rubio’s version states that it is the US government’s policy “to support the establishment of a genuine democratic option to freely and fairly nominate and elect” Hong Kong’s chief executive and all members of the city’s Legislative Council (LegCo) by 2020. The House version has no such timeline. Hong Kong’s current chief executive, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, was elected in 2017 by a 1,194-member election committee composed mostly of Beijing loyalists. Half of the Legco members are directly elected by voters in geographical constituencies and the remaining 35 members are returned by 29 functional constituencies, which act on the behalf of particular professions and trades. The Senate version also calls for the US government to “coordinate” with allies including Britain, Australia, Japan and South Korea “to promote democracy and human rights in Hong Kong”.

With his right arm in a sling, Ho told reporters outside Ruttonjee Hospital where he was treated that he was attacked while walking between Tin Hau MTR station and a minibus stop at about 7pm. He said he was beaten with long objects by two black-clad and masked men in an alley as he was on his way home from work. The case is being investigated by the Eastern district police’s crime division. “I shouted at them and ran towards the bus stop and fell down. Only then did I see it was two male attackers. I shouted again to ask why they were attacking me, and they ran away,” Ho said. “I am not sure why they attacked me, neither did they issue any threats,” Ho said. He said his back was bruised and doctors had told him there could be a fracture in his right arm. Legislators from the Democratic Party issued a statement condemning the attack and urging police to quickly investigate the matter and bring the attackers to justice.  “The string of attacks on democrats over the past few months cannot be condoned in a civil society. We urge police to take these cases seriously and solve them quickly, particularly the cases happening in busy areas which should have ample evidence,” the statement said. Ho was also targeted in 2006, when three men clubbed him with batons and baseball bats in a crowded McDonald’s soon after he took part in a protest march against a proposed sales tax. Knife attack on Hong Kong lawmaker Junius Ho sparks security concerns 7 Nov 2019 Knife attack on Hong Kong lawmaker Junius Ho sparks security concerns 7 Nov 2019 Several other democratic politicians and activists have been attacked throughout the city’s five-month-long unrest. In October, Civil Human Rights Front convenor Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit was left lying in a pool of blood after four to five masked men assaulted him with hammers.  Sham was also attacked with baseball bats in August while eating at a restaurant, while Yuen Long protest organiser Max Chung Kin-ping was also assaulted on the same day.  In September, legislator Roy Kwong Chun-yu was attacked in Tin Shui Wai and Labour Party member Stanley Ho Wai-hong was assaulted in Sai Kung. Anti-parallel trading activist Ronald Leung Kam-shing was also ambushed in Sha Tin in August, a month after he organised a “reclaim Sheung Shui” protest. He was reportedly warned not to “stir up trouble again”. 	SCMP

The city’s leader, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, said on Tuesday that she hoped the impasse, entering its fourth day by Wednesday, could be resolved peacefully, with those injured and aged under 18 handled in a humane manner. She pledged that the minors would not be arrested but would only have their names recorded for the time being. Since Sunday evening, police have surrounded the campus following a day of extremely violent clashes which the force declared to be a riot. Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University On Monday, hard core radicals went on a rampage all over Kowloon, wreaking havoc by blocking roads and setting off petrol bombs in a bid to distract the police and thin out their ranks at the campus. Stretches of Nathan Road were damaged by bricks, barricades and fires, with Tsim Sha Tsui, Jordan, Yau Ma Tei and Mong Kok witnessing some of the night’s most chaotic scenes that continued well into the early hours of Tuesday.  Police fired 1,458 rounds of tear gas, 1,391 rubber bullets, 325 beanbag rounds and 265 sponge grenades on Monday.

They are expected to appear in West Kowloon Magistracy on Wednesday morning. Tuesday night offered a respite of sorts for police, with only about 100 protesters active in Mong Kok. The force maintained a light presence and nothing more came of the stand-off.

Carrie Lam said the record high showed the government and police force were capable of handling the situation, dismissing suggestions that the People’s Liberation Army could be called upon to restore order to the city. Asked about continuing speculation Sunday’s district council elections could be postponed, Lam renewed her appeal for protesters to call a halt to their violent tactics so that “just and fair” elections could be staged. Hundreds were evacuated overnight from inside the campus after 75 secondary school heads and teachers, along with political and legal heavyweights, persuaded them after coordinating with police. A few groups, numbering about a dozen each, also emerged on Tuesday with some suffering from hypothermia and leg injuries. In the evening, another 12 or so came out accompanied by opposition lawmaker Ted Hui Chi-fung, who was allowed to go home without being arrested.

A total of 280 injured protesters from PolyU were sent to 12 public hospitals in batches on Tuesday afternoon, a spokesman from the Hospital Authority said. On Tuesday night, newly-minted Police Commissioner Chris Tang Ping-keung who took over the post on Monday made an appearance outside the campus to boost the morale of his men out in force for three days. Auxiliary Bishop of Hong Kong Joseph Ha Chi-shing also visited the campus as he wanted to tell the young people inside to believe in hope, as he had heard they were ready to die defending the school.

New police chief faces challenge of ending unrest and winning trust 19 Nov 2019 New police chief faces challenge of ending unrest and winning trust 19 Nov 2019 By Tuesday evening, a Post reporter observed at least three teams still searching for an elusive exit from campus. One group of about 20 had attempted to flee from nearby roads in the early afternoon, but their mission was aborted when police were seen patrolling near a flyover. Post Some defiant protesters said they would fight until they got arrested. “We will not turn ourselves in – that’s conceding defeat,” said Eric, 18, a student who had been on campus for three days. “We will just hide or maybe lock ourselves in a room.” He said he had only slept for five hours during the past three days as he tried to find a way out or stay alert to any advance from police. Protesters estimated that about 60 to 100 of their peers remained on campus, with many of those still there not PolyU students or possibly having never attended any university. Among them was radical protester Sum Yiu, 25, who finished school when he was 19 and worked in various driving jobs since. “We just wanted to protect the students, but there are no students for us to protect,” Yiu said. “We can’t even protect ourselves.” Police investigate alleged attack on Albert Ho 20 Nov 2019 Police investigate alleged attack on Albert Ho 20 Nov 2019 He said he understood why some chose to go. “We are outnumbered and we can only hope police will not storm in,” he said.

While the first aid workers were being searched by riot police, a small group of protesters attempted to escape, making a break for it by climbing over a fence. However, they were spotted and more than 10 were arrested.

A total of over 8000 petrol bombs had been founded on the campus, a source told the Post. Post At the same briefing, Senior Superintendent Kong Wing-cheung addressed allegations of brutality when subduing protesters. “They intentionally put up struggle and resistance no matter, to make room and create time for others to rescue them,” Kong said. “In subduing these kinds of rioters, we have to do it quickly and with appropriate force.” On Wednesday, defiant protesters are planning to block traffic and trains to revive their weekday campaign of chaos.

The security measures were among a raft of changes unveiled by Electoral Affairs Commission chief Barnabas Fung Wah on Tuesday as concerns grow about Hong Kong’s ability to hold trouble-free polls after five months of unrest. The city’s leader, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, renewed her appeal to protesters to halt the violent tactics so that “just and fair” elections could be staged for the local councils of Hong Kong’s 18 districts. But the stepped-up security plans have sparked concern among candidates who fear the last-minute “hasty” changes could discourage Hongkongers from heading to the polls. Fung on Tuesday said he hoped the extra work by the electoral watchdog would ensure the elections went ahead as planned on November 24 amid suggestions that authorities could cancel the exercise. “I sincerely hope and beseech everyone in Hong Kong to uphold the integrity of our elections, which is our long-treasured tradition,” he said.  The polling stations to be relocated include one at the Sassoon Road Assembly Hall at the University of Hong Kong in Pok Fu Lam, another at Hong Kong Community College at Polytechnic University in Hung Hom, a voting station at the Jockey Club Primary School inside the Education University of Hong Kong in Tai Po, and booths at the John Fulton Centre at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in Sha Tin. The district council polls – the first citywide elections since Hong Kong’s social unrest erupted in June – come against the backdrop of escalating confrontations between demonstrators and police as part of a protest movement sparked by a proposed change to extradition law.  The campuses of Chinese University and PolyU have been turned into combat zones in the past week as protesters threw petrol bombs and shot arrows while police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Hong Kong’s district council elections must proceed as planned, European Union urges Hong Kong’s district council elections must proceed as planned, European Union urges Hundreds of protesters at the weekend barricaded themselves inside PolyU where they resisted attempts by riot police to enter the campus. Dozens remained holed up inside on Tuesday night, looking for ways to escape undetected.  Fung said the extra security guards would be there on Sunday to handle contingencies, and non-canvassing areas set up outside polling stations as safe zones would be expanded to ensure voters were not disturbed or harassed. However, he warned that the commission had the power to postpone the polls or vote counting for a week, should there be any violence affecting the safety of voters that could not be resolved with a suspension lasting 90 minutes. Leo Chu Tsz-lok, a candidate with the Democratic Party, the city’s biggest pro-democracy party, said the relocation of polling booths was undesirable. The voting station at Hong Kong Community College was hundreds of metres away from the sites of recent protests, he said. “It is confusing and will affect turnout,” said Chu, who is running in East Tsim Sha Tsui and King’s Park, which are affected by the changes. Voters in his constituency would be forced to head to a station in Yau Ma Tei, he said. Lam on Tuesday said her hands were tied when asked if the polls would go ahead. “It is not us creating chaos and threats,” the city’s chief executive said. “We strongly appeal to all, including rioters, to stop violence and threatening acts ... If voters cannot cast their votes in a safe environment, it is difficult to conduct a fair and just election.” About 20,000 staff had to be able to safely arrive at polling stations for elections to be held, she added. A source familiar with the government’s position said the administration had never moved on its stance that the elections should be held as scheduled. But the source said the government needed to monitor the situation and had not set a deadline for a final decision. Chief Executive Carrie Lam vows Hong Kong’s district council elections will be held on time – despite mainland media calling citywide peace a prerequisite 13 Nov 2019 Chief Executive Carrie Lam vows Hong Kong’s district council elections will be held on time – despite mainland media calling citywide peace a prerequisite 13 Nov 2019 “Of course the government won’t announce a delay shortly before polling stations open at 7.30am on Sunday. There must be a reasonable buffer of time before the polls start,” the source said. “It’s a matter of art, instead of science, when it comes to under which exact circumstances the elections would be delayed.” Another source familiar with the preparations for the elections said officers responsible for each polling station had collected the ballot papers on Monday. They will hold meetings with police representatives on Wednesday to iron out arrangements for Sunday. Chu is running against incumbent Michelle Tang Ming-sum, who did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. More than 610 ordinary polling stations and 23 dedicated stations will be open for more than 4.13 million registered electors to cast their votes. 	SCMP

Eastern Court on Tuesday heard that Chow Man, 26, was accused of carrying a host of used ammunition without a licence, when he was stopped by officers at Exit B of Sai Wan Ho MTR station in the early hours of November 18. Court documents showed the collection included 23 pieces of submunitions of 38mm CS projectile round, nine pieces of submunitions of CS hand grenade, five cartridges of 38mm CS projectile round and a piece of CS hand grenade fragment. He was also accused of carrying a cartridge of a 38mm rubber baton round and another of a 40mm React round, meaning a sponge-tipped bullet. But the Tseung Kwan O resident was not required to enter a plea on a count of possession of ammunition without a licence as prosecutors sought more time for forensic examination and legal consultation. Principal Magistrate Bina Chainrai adjourned the case to January 14 next year and remanded the man in custody.

Only 13 defendants appeared before Principal Magistrate Peter Law Tak-chuen in the first hearing, as six of them were still in hospital. The defence counsel complained some of their clients had been subject to assaults by police officers even though they did not resist arrest. The defence counsel also said some defendants had been denied medical help in police custody. But Law said the court had no power to urge police to address the defendants’ complaints, and the court was only concerned with the legal proceedings.

Lee Chi-cheung, 57, was left fighting for his life after the attack, which occurred on November 11 after a dispute with a group of masked protesters who had vandalised an MTR station in Ma On Shan in Hong Kong’s New Territories. According to police, he witnessed the vandalism and chased after the protesters. He was then attacked and suffered head injuries. As he walked away, he shouted “You are not Chinese” to the group. The protesters responded by yelling “We are Hongkongers”. He returned to confront them and a dispute ensued, during which he was doused with flammable liquid and set alight. Police have classified the case as attempted murder and a spokeswoman from the Fire Services Department said Lee had sustained second-degree burns to 28 per cent of his body.

Only a few dozen people, including social workers and first-aid volunteers, were believed to be still inside Polytechnic University on Tuesday evening, after police blocked all exits from the Hung Hom campus on Sunday evening following a day of extremely violent clashes. That was a much smaller crowd than Sunday, and according to police as of Tuesday afternoon about 1,100 had been arrested or surrendered. In the early hours of Tuesday, several people were seen jumping down an underground tunnel through a manhole inside the campus in a bid to escape. But only about 10 minutes later, they climbed back out from another manhole. “It was disgusting inside the drains,” one masked man said. “We resorted to doing so because we did not know how to seek help from the outside world. “But even if we managed to do so, I don’t think they would be able to help us. What else can we do?”  Some radicals had already discussed escaping through manholes on Monday night. One estimated it could take two hours to reach the end of the tunnel system in Hung Hom and get out, admitting that the move could be life-threatening because of the possible harmful gas underground. It remained unclear how many in total had tried to escape through this channel. But firefighters conducted a search inside the systems on Tuesday morning and found no one.  Police have been calling on those inside the campus to surrender and exit the campus peacefully through police checkpoints, though those that do run the risk of being arrested for rioting offences, which can bring a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail. But, under deals that education figures and politicians secured with the police, those under the age of 18 would be allowed to go home after their personal information had been recorded by officers.  However, they could still be charged for rioting offences in the future. In dramatic scenes on Monday night, dozens of radicals descended about seven metres down ropes from a campus footbridge onto a highway, and were picked up by motorcycles waiting below. Riot police arrived soon afterwards and fired tear gas, arresting several as they tried to escape. Throughout Monday night, and into the early hours of Tuesday, dozens of protesters were seen running from one side of the campus to another side to look for gaps in police’s defensive lines. Some climbed over campus walls to escape through Chatham Road South, but none appeared to succeed. Eric, an 18-year-old student who has been on campus for three days, had been looking for secret passages out without getting arrested. “We won’t turn ourselves in; that’s basically confessing our loss,” he said. “We will just hide, or maybe just lock ourselves in some rooms.” He has slept only five hours for the past three days as he has been constantly looking for ways out, while staying on high alert in case police enter the campus. During the violent clashes on Sunday, radical protesters threw a large number of petrol bombs at police, who responded with tear gas and water cannons. Footbridges were set on fire as crowds tried to block officers. A police armoured vehicle at a flyover next to the campus was set on fire. The driver had to put the vehicle in reverse, rumbling away from the crowd as they pelted it with petrol bombs. 	SCMP

But unlike previous days, anti-riot police intervened early to prevent them from blocking the roads. Armed with shields and riot control weapons, dozens of officers took up a position on a footbridge nearby. They quickly moved down to clear protesters in Pedder Street to the side of the road, where a crowd stayed to chant slogans, with some shouting at police. About 50 police officers guarded the junction of Pedder Street and Des Voeux Road Central from 1pm, repeatedly raising a blue flag to warn the assembly was illegal. “If you don’t want to lose your promising future, leave immediately because you are in an illegal assembly, “ a police officer said. Tensions rose at around 2pm when six police vans arrived. Two people were seen to be questioned by police and let go. Sunny Wong, in her 20s, who stayed on the roadside on Pedder Street wearing a mask, said she was not afraid of riot police. “Nowadays you can get caught by just walking on the street.

Heaps of rubbish, bricks and barricades littered the roads of Tsim Sha Tsui East, cutting off access to the area. Roads on the scenic waterfront were ripped open on Monday as radicals unearthed bricks, leaving nothing but dusty and barren pavements in their wake. Some members of the public began to remove barricades on Tuesday, among them property developer Sino Group chairman Robert Ng Chee Siong, 67, and his son Daryl Ng Win-kong, 41. The pair rolled up their sleeves, put on gloves, and removed bricks with brooms and by hand. The company’s headquarters is in the neighbourhood. Scenes of destruction in streets surrounding besieged Hong Kong Polytechnic University Scenes of destruction in streets surrounding besieged Hong Kong Polytechnic University Scenes of destruction in streets surrounding besieged Hong Kong Polytechnic University On a section of Granville Road opposite to the Science Museum, which was the epicentre of the clashes, most of the shops and restaurants remained shut. “We closed at around 2pm yesterday because a lot was going on outside,” said Wong Siu-ying, 30, owner of the Golden Chinese Hamburger restaurant. “We’ll close earlier again today if the police and protesters start fighting again.”  Wong said the store was closed for nearly the whole of last week because there was no transport as many roads were blocked, and all the bricks were pried loose so it was very hard to walk around nearby. He said the metal shutter on his store stopped tear gas from getting indoors on Monday, when the neighbourhood descended into chaos, and a fiery battle broke out between hundreds of radicals and police. Police said officers in the Yau Tsim district received multiple reports of a large number of dangerous items, including corrosive fluid and petrol bombs, being found on the street.  “It’s been quite messy in Tsim Sha Tsui over the past few days. I don’t really support either side, but I don’t think it needs to be this way. I hope the situation ends soon, it can’t go on like this for much longer,” said Chung, a hotel worker in his 40s.  Restaurants such as the City Chiu Chow Restaurant, Sportful Garden Restaurant, and Cafe 98, on Granville Road had their gates closed tightly as of noon, and currency exchange, pharmacies and jewellery stores were all closed, leaving the normally busy street deserted. On the usually bustling Nathan Road in Jordan, a district next to Tsim Sha Tsui, some shops including department stores and a money exchange reopened on Tuesday morning, despite most stores remaining closed. Clashes took place on the roads nearby as multiple rounds of tear gas had been fired in the area on Monday, and government workers were clearing bricks on Jordan Road with construction vehicles. Among the shops which reopened was department store, Yue Hwa Chinese Products Emporium.

Few shoppers were seen inside the store, and those that did venture out wore masks, as did the staff. Ms Li, 39, looked at jewellery with her mother, and both wore particulate respirator masks. Li said she lives in Tsim Sha Tsui and was passing by after taking her mother, who is in her 70s, to a doctor’s appointment earlier. “We are not too worried,” she said. A salesman of Chinese medicine and health care products in the department store said he could not be sure if the tear gas would affect their products, but said most were sealed, and expensive and valuable traditional Chinese medicine would be moved away from the shelf at night. A vegetarian restaurant on Jordan Road near Nathan Road reopened at 8.30am on Tuesday, selling dim sum to residents nearby. A female employee, surnamed Poon, said the restaurant had undergone a thorough cleaning before reopening on Tuesday, and its floor, tables and chairs were all disinfected.    Monday’s leftovers had also been thrown away and dim sum had been freshly made on Tuesday morning, said Poon, who travelled two hours to work from Sha Tin. More than 10 staff were present at work on Tuesday as the owner did not instruct them not to go to work, she said. But business at the restaurant had been hit badly since protests began in June, she said, with revenue down an average of about 70 per cent compared to before the protests. Daily profit was just more than HK$1,000 (US$127) over the past two weeks, compared with before the protests began. “Business has declined disastrously … with a daily revenue of just over HK$1,000 a day it is impossible to cover the costs, let alone our salary. There are at least 3 staff handling dim sums, some waiters and also those who work in the kitchen,” she said. But she said she was “not too worried” about not being paid, adding that the restaurant would try to remain open whenever possible. At Pak Shing Building on Jordan Road near Parkes Street, a newspaper stand outside the building was reportedly reduced to ashes at around midnight on Monday, while one of the building’s entrances was also partly scorched.    A resident in that building, surnamed Wong and in her 30s, said the blaze started at 11.45pm on Monday. Wong, who lives with her elderly parents, said the fire was getting bigger after it started burning, so they decided to evacuate before the fire alarm was triggered. The “smoke and residue from tear gas” caused her and parents to cough, and she more than 100 residents, most of them elderly, evacuated as police and firefighters arrived and put out the fire by about 12.30am. “I still feel a shortness of breath this [Tuesday] morning,” she said. She said she “did not dare” go onto the streets since clashes started on Sunday night, and went out for the first time on Tuesday afternoon. ‘Cold and hungry’ radicals surrender as Lam tells police to let minors go home 19 Nov 2019 ‘Cold and hungry’ radicals surrender as Lam tells police to let minors go home 19 Nov 2019 At the Yau Ma Tei wholesale fruit market, some fruit stalls opened as usual, although many were closed and not many shoppers were spotted.

The owner of one stall said the rumours were false, but it was difficult to persuade people otherwise. “Of course there would be people believing them,” she said. “That’s always the case, and they are free to choose not to buy any fruits from us.” Another stall owner said most of the stalls were closed when tear gas was fired, and produce was not left exposed to open air. “If tear gas residue fired nearby really got blown towards the fruit market, there’s nothing we can do about that,” he said. The stall owners have seen a 50 per cent drop in revenue compared to before June, the owner said, but income from wholesaling had not been affected much as market demand for fruit remained consistent.

The Form Five student, surnamed Tai, was at the Kwai Chung police station, Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon. A lawyer had confirmed she was the station at noon and her mother had been able to travel there at around 1pm to help with her case, the statement said. The girl is understood to have been inside the campus since Sunday afternoon and had been scared to leave when police earlier warned that those at Polytechnic University could face charges of rioting, which carry a jail sentence of up to 10 years. “Our representative office continued to obtain relevant information from the student’s mother and actively provided assistance while remaining in constant contact with Tai’s mother,” the MAC said. “We again remind our citizens in Hong Kong to be alert to their safety and stay far away from protest conflict areas.” Worried parents caught up in police siege of university in Hong Kong 19 Nov 2019 Worried parents caught up in police siege of university in Hong Kong 19 Nov 2019 The MAC said earlier that Taiwan’s representative office in Hong Kong, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO), had been in touch with the girl until she lost her mobile phone on Monday, but had spoken with her mother several times and determined that she was safe. Taiwan’s Central News Agency (CNA) reported that Tai left the university campus around midnight, with a group of secondary school principals, and had been arrested. Her parents told the agency they did not know what charges their daughter faced.  The parents said their daughter had left the home before noon on Sunday to head towards Mong Kok, then went to Tsim Sha Tsui at around 4pm in the afternoon and “may have seen riot police dispersing the area and run into Polytechnic University” before she became trapped, CNA reported. The parents said their daughter was not taking part in protests at the university and had sought to escape from the campus, but found all exits were surrounded by riot police.

After losing her mobile phone, the girl had borrowed someone else’s phone every two hours to send a message to her parents to let them know she was OK, even as those inside the university struggled with injuries and lack of water and food, the parents said. On Tuesday morning Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said that about 600 protesters, including 200 aged under 18, had left the university since police surrounded the campus on Sunday. She said those under 18 had been allowed to go home after their personal details were recorded by police, with police reserving the right to arrest them later. ‘Cold and hungry’ radicals surrender as Lam tells police to let minors go home 19 Nov 2019 ‘Cold and hungry’ radicals surrender as Lam tells police to let minors go home 19 Nov 2019 Earlier, on Monday afternoon, the MAC warned that the situation at Polytechnic University could turn into a humanitarian crisis, and slammed the threat to campus democracy and safety. “The MAC condemns all kinds of violence and hardline suppression, and urges all sides to exercise calm and restraint, using peaceful and rational dialogue to resolve issues, to avoid the deterioration of the situation and deepening societal scars,” it said. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has been vocal in supporting the Hong Kong protesters and their demands for greater democracy and autonomy during the more than five months of unrest, which plunged the city into its worst political crisis since the former British colony was transferred to Chinese rule in 1997.

This includes 76 from Polytechnic University and 261 students from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, which also earlier saw violent confrontations between police and student radicals. Many Taiwanese students in the city have said that most of their community would not take part in frontline protests, due to the higher risks for their participation as Taiwanese citizens. One Chinese University student from Taiwan, who declined to be named, said earlier that TECO helped him fly back home last Wednesday after clashes at his school, which saw the campus rained down upon with tear gas, rubber bullets, and petrol bombs. “I didn’t go to the front line to protest, but I had classmates who helped pass supplies to those in the front, hoping to help those who were injured,” he said. “I just wanted everyone else at the university to be safe, and for the conflicts to not escalate any further.” 	SCMP

As of 3pm on Tuesday, police said, about 1,100 people from the campus and nearby had been arrested or, if they were minors, had their particulars registered before they were allowed to go home.  About 600 left voluntarily, including 200 minors. The adults included 47 PolyU teaching and administrative staff. John said he arrived on Sunday to look for his 18-year-old son, a PolyU student. Then the situation took a turn for the worse. Radicals at PolyU rained petrol bombs on police and set an armoured vehicle of the force ablaze. Police responded with volleys of tear gas, then cut off all campus exits and ordered those inside to leave.  Of those who emerged, only accredited journalists were not arrested.

The father arrived to search for the boy the next day. “I did not do anything, I just came to get my kid,” Li said. “I don’t want to be arrested.” The father and son found each other at 7pm on Sunday, by which police had already put the campus on lockdown.

They feared that they would be shot if they obeyed the police order to leave, she said, yet they were also worried that if they remained, there would be no reporters present to witness what happened to them. Despite the threat of being arrested for rioting, the social worker said she did not regret going there.  “We are not the ones who have paid the heaviest price,” she said. “I don’t want to be on the sidelines.” Anti-mask law ruling from Hong Kong judges slammed by Beijing 20 Nov 2019 Anti-mask law ruling from Hong Kong judges slammed by Beijing 20 Nov 2019 Pak, a 20-year-old who described himself as a first-aider, said he was struggling to decide whether to leave. “I came to save people,” he said. He said many first-aiders were considering surrendering because they did not want to risk harming police officers if they needed to use force to get out.  In a daring episode on Monday night, dozens of people found a spot at the edge of the campus and abseiled down a footbridge to a highway and took off in getaway vehicles. But many others remained on campus overnight, but on Tuesday morning, some of those who decided to leave said they were cold and hungry. “We only had biscuits,” a boy said. “We haven’t eaten since yesterday afternoon.” Rain Lau, 28, said some volunteers managed to cook some noodles on Monday night, but the situation had deteriorated and there was only packaged food. Lau said she went to the PolyU campus for a “safeguard children rally” on Saturday and ended up being trapped there. She said she was too tired to stay much longer, even if it meant being arrested. “Lawyers have also told us we won’t be charged immediately and can probably be bailed,” she said. Nathan, 18, was in a group that left the campus on Tuesday morning, prepared to be arrested. His mother reported him to his school principal.

Among the principals who spent Monday night on campus trying to persuade their students to leave was Joshua Lau Chi-kin, who said many refused to go because they did not want to leave others behind. He spent three hours talking to two students, aged 15 and 16, advising them to leave on Tuesday morning. “They felt their comrades were still there,” he said. “I could only tell them I was worried about them.” On Tuesday afternoon, Yang, a mainlander, was holding a large piece of paper that said: “I am a visitor from the mainland and I have been trapped in the campus for two days. I am so scared, I want to go home!” He said he planned to visit the nearby History Museum on Sunday with a PolyU student but found the museum closed, so they went to the campus instead. “I visited the library and wanted to leave at about 5pm or 6pm, but the exits were closed so we stayed for dinner,” he said. He spent the next two days taking refuge in the library. “I’ve been so scared, it’s been like a battlefield, particularly the fires and shooting,” Yang said. “I just want to leave, but they said whoever goes out will be accused of rioting.” On Tuesday afternoon, nine parents worried about their children were seen holding cardboard signs at the police cordon outside New Mandarin Plaza shopping centre in Tsim Sha Tsui. One poster said: “Always support and love you. Just want you to be safe!” The mother of a fourth-year University of Hong Kong student said: “He is very peace-loving and is not a protester. He only went into the campus to support the movement. He is trapped inside with his girlfriend. “He wants to come out, but he said he was afraid to come out, most likely because the government will label him a rioter.” Another mother, surnamed Lau, said her 20-year-old son was inside the campus. “As parents, we feel very helpless,” she said. Another mother said: “As parents, we only wish that they come out safely, and hope they won’t be treated unfairly.” 	SCMP

The EU said it would support all those who would work towards de-escalation and establishing such a dialogue.  It said: “A comprehensive inquiry into the violence, use of force and the root causes of the protests is a critical element in de-escalation efforts.”  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also urged restraint from all sides and said the US was “gravely concerned by the deepening political unrest and violence in Hong Kong”.

The Chinese diplomatic mission in the EU said China expressed strong opposition to the EU statement. A spokesman said that the Hong Kong police were protecting the lives and property of the Hong Kong public, and that it was wrong for the EU to confuse the police enforcing law with “radical, violent behaviour”. “We call on the European Union to stop making irresponsible and wrong remarks, and stop interfering in Hong Kong in any way,” the spokesman said.

According to the state-run Xinhua news agency, Zang, speaking on behalf of the NPCSC’s Legislative Affairs Commission, said the national legislature was the only body that could decide whether Hong Kong laws complied with the Basic Law, which provides the legal underpinnings for post-handover Hong Kong. Anti-mask law in Hong Kong ruled unconstitutional by High Court 19 Nov 2019 Anti-mask law in Hong Kong ruled unconstitutional by High Court 19 Nov 2019 “[China’s] constitution and the Basic Law jointly form the constitutional foundation of [Hong Kong],” he said. “Whether Hong Kong’s laws are consistent with the Basic Law can only be judged and decided by the NPCSC. No other authority has the right to make judgments and decisions.” The move had also “weakened” the administrative power of the city’s leader, Zang said.  In separate statements, Yang Guang, spokesman of the State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), Beijing’s highest policy office on Hong Kong matters, warned the court ruling would have a “serious and negative sociopolitical impact”. A spokesman for Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong too weighed in, urging the city’s executive, legislative and judicial branches to respect the NPCSC’s decisions when exercising their power. The statement appears to suggest that the HK courts have no power to hold HK legislation to be invalid... If this is what was meant, it is surprising and alarming Andrew Li Kwok-nang, former chief justice Hong Kong’s first postcolonial chief justice Andrew Li Kwok-nang expressed fears in an interview with the Post, saying the comments coming from Beijing would be “surprising and alarming” if it meant local courts had no power to hold the city’s legislation to be invalid based on inconsistency. Post On Monday, Hong Kong’s High Court ruled in favour of pan-democrats’ judicial review application when it declared the government’s mask ban unconstitutional. The decision forced police to suspend the enforcement of the regulation, enacted last month in a bid to quell the five months of mass protests roiling the city in which many demonstrators wore face coverings to hide their identity. Prosecutors asked for an adjournment after the ruling but the Department of Justice (DOJ) has not indicated if it would take the case to the Court of Appeal while Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor on Tuesday declined to comment on any move, saying the matter was under review.  If the DOJ does appeal, the decision could eventually end up being brought all the way to the Court of Final Appeal eventually.  The Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation, made into law via the Emergency Regulations Ordinance (ERO) – legislation undisturbed for more than half a century – forbids anyone from wearing “facial coverings” likely to conceal identity at public assemblies. Those convicted face up to one year in jail and a HK$25,000 (US$3,187) fine. Hong Kong protesters go on violent rampage over government’s new anti-mask law Hong Kong protesters go on violent rampage over government’s new anti-mask law Hong Kong protesters go on violent rampage over government’s new anti-mask law Beijing’s statement issued in the early hours of Tuesday morning caught Hong Kong’s opposition pan-democrats and several prominent legal eagles by surprise, as they questioned whether Beijing was suggesting two things: one, Hong Kong’s courts did not have the right to interpret the city’s mini-constitution and two, it could be moving soon to interpret the Basic Law on the issue of the mask ban. But legal experts in the pro-establishment camp and mainland China dismissed such concerns, stressing that the central government was only highlighting the fact that the power of interpretation of the Basic Law shall be vested in the NPCSC, as enshrined under Article 158 of the mini-constitution. While he indicated this could be one meaning to be drawn from Beijing’s comment, former chief justice Andrew Li said: “The statement appears to suggest that the Hong Kong courts have no power to hold Hong Kong legislation to be invalid on the ground of inconsistency with the Basic Law. If this is what was meant, it is surprising and alarming. “Since 1997, our courts have held that they have such power, whilst fully accepting that any interpretation by the NPCSC would be binding in Hong Kong. The NPCSC in its 1999 and subsequent interpretations did not suggest otherwise. “I hope this is not what the statement meant. Maybe it meant that any NPCSC interpretation would be binding, which our courts have fully accepted,” he said. Hong Kong’s District Council elections must proceed as planned, EU urges 19 Nov 2019 Hong Kong’s District Council elections must proceed as planned, EU urges 19 Nov 2019 Li went on to reiterate his previously held view that the NPCSC’s power to interpret the Basic Law should only be exercised in exceptional circumstances. “It should refrain from doing so after a court judgment as that would have an adverse impact on at least the perception of judicial independence in Hong Kong,” Li added. Article 158 of the Basic Law states that when adjudicating cases related to Beijing’s affairs or its relationship with Hong Kong, the Court of Final Appeal could seek an interpretation of the Basic Law from the NPCSC before making a final judgment. The NPCSC could also take the initiative to interpret the Basic Law, either before or after a final judgment was made by the local top court, but such moves in the past were strongly criticised by the legal sector as a blow to the city’s judicial independence. Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of The Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said Zang’s strongly-worded statements showed the NPCSC would take action soon. “[The NPCSC] can come up with a decision that the ERO is in conformity with the Basic Law … I expect the standing committee to act very soon,” he said. Maria Tam Wai-chu, vice-chairwoman of the Basic Law Committee, which advises the national legislature on the city’s mini-constitution, said she would not rule out the possibility of another interpretation being made. Tam Yiu-chung, Hong Kong’s sole representative to the NPCSC, also said the body could clarify whether all local laws – including the ERO – being adopted when the city returned from British rule in 1997, were constitutional. “It would be best if the High Court’s ruling can be overturned by the Court of Final Appeal (CFA),” he added. It would be best if the High Court’s ruling can be overturned by the Court of Final Appeal Tam Yiu-chung, NPCSC delegate University of Hong Kong law professor Fu Hualing said at this stage, he did not expect the NPC to immediately take the next step of interpreting the Basic Law. “It’s just a warning from a spokesperson at this stage, and it will depend on the court’s stance in the next phase,” Fu said. “I believe there will still be an appeal and there’s still room for Hong Kong.” Li Xiaobing, a law professor with Nankai University, added that the ruling had sought to shape the power structure of the city against the executive branch. “It constrained the power of the chief executive and tried to shape Hong Kong’s constitutional system into a separation of three powers,” he said. “It also placed limits on the government’s effort to stop the violence.” But former Bar Association chairman Ronny Tong Ka-wah, also a member of the Executive Council – the cabinet of Hong Kong’s leader – said he hoped Beijing would leave it to the city’s top court to decide whether an interpretation was needed. “I hope an interpretation would not come so soon, because the timing is too sensitive. It will have a big impact on the city’s situation, and cause a high response from the international community,” he added. I hope an interpretation would not come so soon, because the timing is too sensitive. It will have a big impact on the city’s situation Ronny Tong, Exco member Cautioning against such a move, pan-democrat and Civic Party leader Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu said by declaring the High Court ruling suspect, “the approach would not solve problems in the city, it might only make things worse”. A senior legal figure, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said: “If the standing committee interprets the Basic Law after the High Court made its ruling on the constitutionality of the anti-mask law, the negative impact on the perception of Hong Kong’s judicial independence would be more serious than that stemming from its interpretation of the Basic Law in 2016.” China’s top body lays down law on Hong Kong oath-taking 20 Jul 2018 China’s top body lays down law on Hong Kong oath-taking 20 Jul 2018 In November 2016, the committee waded into a court case involving two newly elected pro-independence lawmakers whom the government was trying to disqualify over anti-China antics during their swearing-in ceremony. Since Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, the NPCSC has issued five interpretations of the Basic Law, in 1999, 2004, 2005, 2011 and 2016. The issues ranged from right of abode, the city’s political reforms, the chief executive’s tenure and lawmakers’ oath of office, to the city’s policy on state immunity. The NPCSC also issued three decisions on Hong Kong issues, in 2004, 2007 and 2014. The three decisions all centred on electoral reforms for the city. In HKMAO spokesman Yang’s statement on Tuesday, he also said: “We will closely monitor the development of this case. We hope that the Hong Kong government and the judiciary would strictly follow the Basic Law in performing their duties, and share the responsibility in stopping violence and chaos, as well as in restoring order.” Two High Court judges, Anderson Chow Ka-ming and Godfrey Lam Wan-ho, on Monday ruled that the colonial-era ERO that brought the ban on face coverings in public places into effect last month was “incompatible with the Basic Law” when used in times of public danger, such as in the present case. They also found the new law had imposed invalid restrictions on fundamental rights and freedoms. In the statement released on Tuesday, Yang said the HKMAO had major concerns with the ruling, adding that the emergency powers legislation was recognised by the NPCSC in February 1997 as compatible with Hong Kong’s mini-constitution. “This means all regulations under the ordinance are compatible with the Basic Law. Hong Kong’s chief executive and the Executive Council were doing their job under the Basic Law and the NPCSC’s decision when they enacted the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation,” Yang argued. He also said since its implementation, the anti-mask law had “played an active role in stopping violence and chaos”. As of Thursday, 632 people had been arrested for violating the regulation, according to police statistics obtained by the Post. Post “The ruling of the High Court’s Court of First Instance ... was a blatant challenge to the authority of the NPCSC, and on the governing powers granted to the chief executive under the law,” Yang added.

The two sides have been locked in a violent confrontation since Sunday, with sporadic clashes over the past 24 hours interspersed with those inside making increasingly desperate bids for freedom. Hundreds were evacuated overnight from inside the university campus after politicians and education figures cut deals with police allowing them to leave. Around 10am, another 50 protesters emerged, with some suffering from hypothermia and leg injuries. Paramedics treated them at a temporary station outside the campus, before they were sent to five city hospitals. Another group of 50 were treated inside the campus in the Lee Shau Kei Building, and would be sent to hospital when ambulances could be arranged to take them.

Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said on Tuesday she had laid out two principles with police for handling the stand-off, that they were to try resolving the incident peacefully, and treat injured or under-aged protesters in a humanitarian manner. Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lam said about 600 protesters, including 200 aged under 18, had so far left the university since police surrounded the campus on Sunday.  “We will use whatever means to continue to persuade and arrange for these remaining protesters to leave the campus as soon as possible,” she said. “So this whole operation can end in a peaceful manner and lay the basis for the subsequent work by the police to stop violence in Hong Kong.” Anti-mask law ruling from Hong Kong judges slammed by Beijing 20 Nov 2019 Anti-mask law ruling from Hong Kong judges slammed by Beijing 20 Nov 2019 Describing the arrangement as exceptional, she said those under 18 had been allowed to go home after their personal details were recorded by police, with police reserving the right to arrest them later.  The calm of the late morning was a different story to the earlier hours of Tuesday, with radicals standing guard at the entrance to the Hung Hom university from about 4am, after fiery clashes with riot police over the past 24 hours had turned the site into a battlefield. turned the site into a battlefield Police surrounded the campus as radicals retreated inside buildings, including the gymnasium, and some slept next to unlit petrol bombs. The university’s president Professor Teng Jin-guang returned on Tuesday to inspect a campus littered with unused petrol bombs, bottles of highly flammable gas and discarded protective equipment. More than 200 students or protesters aged below 18 had left the campus overnight. Some 100 adults also left and were arrested. Earlier, some escaped by abseiling off a footbridge to getaway vehicles below. On Monday, areas bordering the campus, especially the main entrance in Cheong Wan Road, became a battleground between radicals and police. Officers repeatedly fired rounds of rubber bullets and tear gas, while a water cannon truck sprayed blue dye into the campus. The university has been occupied for about a week by hard-core elements of the anti-government movement, who have cut off major road links such as the Cross-Harbour Tunnel in Hung Hom, which connects Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. A police armoured vehicle went up in flames on Sunday from a barrage of petrol bombs thrown by radicals. Police and radicals clash at siege of university campus Police and radicals clash at siege of university campus It followed a similar occupation of campus at Chinese University of Hong Kong on Monday last week. Overnight into the early hours of Tuesday at PolyU, various figures from politics and education reached agreements with police to safely remove young protesters and volunteers inside the campus. They include PolyU council chairman Lam Tai-fai, pro-government politicians Michael Tien Puk-sun and Jasper Tsang, as well as education sector lawmaker Ip Kin-yuen. While minors were let go after police noted down their information, adults were immediately arrested. Referring to the minors, legal scholar Eric Cheung Tat-ming said: “Police kept their promise, only noting down their HKID [Hong Kong Identity Card number], taking photos and letting them go.” He said he is relieved that students were safe and bloodshed had been avoided. Although police had repeatedly declared those on the campus were involved in rioting, Cheung said mere presence within the PolyU campus did not amount to criminal conduct. “Unless police have evidence, such as that someone has thrown a petrol bomb, I don’t think the authority can prove the person is guilty beyond reasonable doubt,” he added. On whether police could still charge those present of unlawful assembly, Cheung said those who were peaceful would be exempt. Democratic Party lawmaker Ted Hui Chi-fung vowed to be the last to leave PolyU. Thousands hit Hong Kong streets in bid to end police campus siege 19 Nov 2019 Thousands hit Hong Kong streets in bid to end police campus siege 19 Nov 2019 “I guess the chance of them charging me for rioting is not small,” Hui said. “I expect them to arrest me first, but I’m convinced they wouldn’t be able to get a conviction.” Hui said it was absurd that police should put the campus in complete lockdown and vow to arrest those inside for rioting. “To arrest everyone on site [for rioting], this is clearly making wanton arrests,” he said. The lawmaker said authorities might be trying to send a message to deter protesters from joining future actions. Two black-clad protesters were among the dozens of diehards who remained on campus on Tuesday morning, despite not being PolyU students.   An 18-year-old said he was also involved in the bid to keep police out of Chinese University last week. “I thought the PolyU situation would be resolved in two days but things didn’t go as expected,” he said, adding he knew the risks of being arrested. Another in his 20s said he was pained by the arrests of protesters outside PolyU, who tried to rescue those trapped inside. He also said he had no plan to surrender. “Surrender you go to jail, don’t surrender you still go to jail, so I would rather not,” he said. Young people, who had dressed out of the typical protest attire of black, were also heard arguing on the phone and ruling out any suggestion of surrendering. Some, however, did leave as a group or alongside school principals who had arrived on the scene with Ip. An 18-year-old called Nathan was among the batch who left Polytechnic University campus on Tuesday morning, and he estimated there were around 200 people still inside. “We have already tried multiple times to break through police’s defence, yesterday at 5am, then 10am, and another time,” he said. “Each time we lost 50 people and another 100, the chance of walking out free is fading away.” Polytechnic University war zone: how radicals got boxed in by police 19 Nov 2019 Polytechnic University war zone: how radicals got boxed in by police 19 Nov 2019 Mrs Chung, who said her 16-year-old daughter was still inside, said the teenager refused to listen to her, and did not believe the police would let her just walk out. “No one can ask her to come out now. She wants to walk out freely, and does not believe the police at all,” she said. “She communicates with me but refuses to listen to me”. The mother said her daughter at first only joined peaceful protests, but started to become more aggressive after clashes at Chinese University, and had been inside the campus since Sunday. “Her sudden change of attitude was probably due to peer pressure, I really don’t know,” she said. Train services remained suspended between Hung Hom and Austin station on the West Rail Line, and between Hung Hom and Mong Kok East station on the East Rail Line. The MTR stations of Hung Hom, Tsim Sha Tsui, Tsim Sha Tsui East, Whampoa and University were also closed. Hong Kong hospital guards against tear gas as clashes break out nearby 19 Nov 2019 Hong Kong hospital guards against tear gas as clashes break out nearby 19 Nov 2019 Roads surrounding PolyU campus – such as Chatham Road, Cheong Wan Road and Hong Chong Road and Gascoigne Road – were still blocked, as of Tuesday morning. The aftermath of intense overnight clashes between radicals and police in Kowloon left locals struggling with the effects of tear gas still hanging in the air on Tuesday morning. Most vehicles could not pass through the junction of Nathan Road and Jordan Road in Jordan with roadblocks still in place for the morning commute. At least three construction vehicles started clearing bricks strewn across the road at about 7.30am. Passers-by in Nathan Road wore masks and used their hands to cover their faces as they struggled with the after-effects of the chemical irritant fired by police to disperse radical protesters just hours earlier. Missing chemicals from universities spark fears over public safety 19 Nov 2019 Missing chemicals from universities spark fears over public safety 19 Nov 2019 A woman surnamed Ng, who has a broken leg and poliomyelitis and needed to carry a walking stick, said she felt it was her responsibility to go to work. The secondary school administrator in Kowloon City, who lives in Yau Ma Tei, was in the area looking for a taxi. “Schools are still open [despite suspension of classes], what if some kids still headed to school?” Ng said, who did not reveal her political views but called for the government to take steps towards resolving the protest crisis. There was also the lingering smell of tear gas at the intersection of Mody Road and Science Museum Road, in Tsim Sha Tsui. Nearby, a man in his 40s, who worked in the hotel industry and gave his surname Chung, said there had to be a resolution. “I don't really support either side, but I don't think it needs to be this way. I hope the situation ends soon, it can't go on like this for much longer,” Chung said. Areas around the tourist district of Tsim Sha Tsui were especially difficult to access. Those roads worst affected for the morning rush hour were Chatham Road South near the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Nathan Road between Argyle Street and Salisbury Road, Hong Chong Road and East Kowloon Way.

They said that the outcome of an expected appeal by the city’s government would determine whether Beijing would intervene. The academics also expressed worries that the ruling may reinforce the suspicion that the Hong Kong judiciary has taken a too lenient approach to cases that involve national security and sovereignty. In a closely watched judicial review case brought by pro-democracy politicians, two Hong Kong High Court judges ruled on Monday that the mask ban introduced by the Hong Kong government under emergency legislation was “incompatible with the Basic Law”, the city’s mini-constitution. Police surround Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus in stand-off with protesters Police surround Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus in stand-off with protesters Police surround Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus in stand-off with protesters Li Xiaobing, a Hong Kong specialist and law professor at Nankai University in Tianjin, described the ruling as “unwise” and feared it would send the wrong message to the radical protesters. “The judgment sent a blurred signal to the outside world and the radicals would feel hugely encouraged,” said Li.  “In a way this signal will have the effect of abetting those radical political forces.” Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of Global Times, a tabloid affiliated to the party mouthpiece People’s Daily, also expressed disappointment of the ruling in a post on Weibo. Global Times People’s Daily Anti-mask law to quell Hong Kong protests ruled unconstitutional by High Court 19 Nov 2019 Anti-mask law to quell Hong Kong protests ruled unconstitutional by High Court 19 Nov 2019 “Many people will see the ruling as the High Court’s accommodation of everything committed by these masked rioters,” Hu wrote  “It will further confuse right and wrong in the Hong Kong society, and prompt more people to take a sympathetic view of the rioters instead of condemning their violence.” Legal experts, however, were more measured over what actions Beijing may take.  They said the Hong Kong government was likely to appeal against the High Court ruling, and suggested that if that appeal fails, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee could issue an interpretation of the Basic Law that “corrects” the judgment. Since the 1997 handover, the NPC Standing Committee has issued five interpretations of the Basic Law. Dozens of students wear masks during graduation ceremony 31 Oct 2019 Dozens of students wear masks during graduation ceremony 31 Oct 2019 “It depends on the next step of the legal process,” said Li, adding that an interpretation by the committee would help clarify any confusion about the law and safeguard Hong Kong’s legal system. “But [Beijing] also needs to take into account how such an interpretation would be received by the legal profession in Hong Kong,” Li said. Tian Feilong, an specialist in Hong Kong policy and a law professor with Beihang University in Beijing, said interpretation of the Basic Law remained a viable option for the NPC Standing Committee. Tian, however, said Monday’s ruling would reinforce a commonly held view among mainland critics that the Hong Kong judiciary has been too lenient in handling politically sensitive cases. Hong Kong protesters defy anti-mask law Hong Kong protesters defy anti-mask law Hong Kong protesters defy anti-mask law Meanwhile, a Beijing-based law professor who requested anonymity because he has been warned not to comment on Hong Kong’s affairs, said the ruling was an example of Hong Kong’s judicial independence. “At least this shows that [in Hong Kong] the government cannot arbitrarily interfere with a court’s rulings,” he said. Over the weekend, the mainland’s propaganda machinery has stepped up its warnings of the protests in Hong Kong that have turned increasingly violent. On Monday People’s Daily warned that there was no room to compromise in the “struggles” with the rioters.

In an exclusive interview with the Post ahead of being sworn in on Tuesday, Chris Tang Ping-keung said the crisis, now in its sixth month, was much more than a law-and-order issue. Post Taking over at a time when police are under unrelenting criticism for alleged excessive use of force, he wished Hongkongers would condemn the violence, saying their silence and tolerance only encouraged the masked radicals wreaking havoc. He also found it worrying that people only pointed fingers at police, but turned a blind eye to violence. “Enough is enough,” he said. “Whatever your beliefs, do not glorify and put up with the violence. Do not let the mob further motivate themselves and become more radicalised.  “If everyone had come out earlier to condemn the violence, society would not have turned into this state in five months. We can only end the unrest with society’s condemnation, reflection by the rioters, plus our appropriate tactics.” New Hong Kong’s police chief on duty after China appointment amid ongoing protests New Hong Kong’s police chief on duty after China appointment amid ongoing protests New Hong Kong’s police chief on duty after China appointment amid ongoing protests Tang, 54, is expected to be sworn in on Tuesday morning as the seventh Commissioner of Police since Hong Kong was handed over by Britain to China in 1997.

About 1,700 people have been injured, including 450 officers. Police have been criticised for using excessive force, including allegations that people have been mistreated and sexually harassed after arrest.

He called the criticism by foreign politicians unfair. “I totally disagree that our officers are out of control and have used excessive force. We use force when there is violence,” he said. “Many of our officers have been brutally attacked. They [drew their guns] to protect themselves, not to suppress the crowd.” Tang said he was prepared for more attacks: both personal and aimed at bringing down the force. “The mob and their supporters do not want us to enforce the law effectively, so they do as much as they can to smear us,” he said. “They have labelled us murderers whenever there was a suicide or an unidentified body. They also threatened to kidnap our children. “Maybe these people know the truth, but they choose not to believe it so as to continue indulging in their ideology.” What are the weapons police use on protesters, and how dangerous are they? 12 Aug 2019 What are the weapons police use on protesters, and how dangerous are they? 12 Aug 2019 A career law enforcement officer and former head of Interpol’s Criminal Organisation and Violent Crime Unit, Tang said people were quick to judge a snapshot of police action without knowing the full picture of what the protesters had done or understanding why officers sometimes continued to hit those who had been caught. Suspects had to be subdued and handcuffed, he explained, or there was a high chance that they would struggle, flee and even attack the officers. Asked if he will apologise for the misconduct of his officers when he is commissioner, Tang replied: “We must look at the situation as a whole, instead of examining every single thing with a magnifier. Do we have to apologise for every segment? “Doing that will undermine the contribution and hard work of my men over the past five months. We make thousands and millions of decisions, it is impossible for each and every one of them to be perfect.” ‘Judge-led inquiry won’t help’ ‘Judge-led inquiry won’t help’ Tang made it plain that police are against having an independent inquiry into allegations of brutality, saying such a judge-led probe will not ease the unrest and violence. judge-led probe will not ease the unrest and violence. “I do not agree that setting up a commission of inquiry can help ease the tension,” said Tang, who was also concerned about the effect such a move would have on the force. “Our staff might think they are being particularly targeted if the well-established mechanism is bypassed. We will be disappointed,” he said. Tang preferred to leave it to the police watchdog to investigate complaints against the force, saying: “I believe the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) can prove our innocence.” Protesters and police in fierce clashes at Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University Protesters and police in fierce clashes at Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University Protesters and police in fierce clashes at Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor recently promised to explore alternatives if the report of the IPCC, due by early next year, did not satisfy supporters of the protest movement. She has so far rejected the protesters’ demand for an independent inquiry into allegations of police brutality, saying it should be left to the police watchdog. The protests, which began in June, were originally against the now-withdrawn extradition bill, formally called the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, which could have seen suspects sent to mainland China, among other jurisdictions with which Hong Kong does not have an exchange arrangement. Police dismiss accusations of excessive force at Prince Edward MTR station 5 Sep 2019 Police dismiss accusations of excessive force at Prince Edward MTR station 5 Sep 2019 The bill has been withdrawn, but protesters have four more demands: an inquiry into alleged police brutality; an end to referring to the protests as riots; amnesty for those arrested; and universal suffrage. an inquiry into alleged police brutality Tang said: “The demands are just slogans. The Chief Executive has withdrawn the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, but I do not see any improvement in the situation.” For now, the IPCC is looking at complaints that police used excessive force at events on six dates between June 9 and August 31. It is also looking into the alleged mistreatment of protesters who were detained at the San Uk Ling Holding Centre, near the mainland Chinese border, in August. San Uk Ling Holding Centre An international expert group appointed to advise the council has said it lacked the power and resources to meet the demands of investigating the conduct of police during protests. has said it lacked the power and resources to meet the demands The council carries out its investigations mainly by looking at case files or internal documents passed to it by the force. Among other things, the five-member expert panel has called for investigative powers to subpoena documents and summon witnesses.    Tang declined to comment on the panel’s remarks, stressing that the IPCC probe was the best option, given the rich experience of council members and that it was an established mechanism for dealing with complaints. ‘Force is still Asia’s finest’ ‘Force is still Asia’s finest’ Critics of police have expressed regret that the Hong Kong force has lost its long-held reputation as Asia’s finest law enforcers. Tang dismissed that assessment, saying, on the contrary, that police have proven themselves amply. “Compared with the use of force and number of casualties in similar social unrest in other countries, our officers have performed relatively well and are very restrained,” he said. “My men maintain high morale and have not quit, despite the tremendous stress and challenges.” He pointed out that as a metropolitan police force in charge of general law and order, the Hong Kong force was not designed to deal with long-term riots, yet has been steadfast in facing the unending unrest and worsening violence. “Our performance over the past five months has highlighted how Hong Kong Police are Asia’s finest,” he said. As the new chief, Tang said this was his message to Hongkongers: “I will support my men fully in the exercise of their duties. To effectively enforce the law, we need public support.” 	SCMP

Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Yau Ma Tei carried out the measures as Gascoigne Road, a main traffic artery next to the facility, was one of the major sites of afternoon clashes between radicals and police. Police fired multiple rounds of tear gas to disperse the radicals. The hospital’s nurses’ quarters and ambulatory care centre, which are closest to the road, were most affected. There was a strong smell of tear gas when the Post was there at around 3pm. Post Patients were asked to stay in safe locations indoors, and those planning to visit the hospital’s specialist outpatient clinic, were asked not to do so on Monday and to reschedule their appointments. Police surround Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus in stand-off with protesters Police surround Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus in stand-off with protesters Police surround Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus in stand-off with protesters Hospital staff distributed and wore N95 masks, which are used to protect against hazardous substances. “We have asked colleagues and patients to close the windows,” said a nurse, who preferred not to reveal his name. “It seems the hospital is installing some ventilation machines around the place. I hope it’s not too late.”  The hospital, which has about 1,900 beds, said it had received reports from staff who smelled an “irritant” in the institution. A “small number” of patients felt unwell, the hospital said, but they were fine after treatment. Services for patients were generally normal.    According to a Facebook page that releases information to staff, the hospital also turned on air curtains to prevent contaminants from getting indoors.  Six portable air purifiers were also installed in some wards. More of those devices would be delivered to the hospital and placed in places deemed necessary.  The hospital’s staff clinic also stepped up services for health care workers who felt unwell after being exposed to tear gas. Staff could walk in without an appointment. But a doctor, who declined to reveal his name, criticised the insufficient support for staff. “Not much was done on safety issues,” he said. “N95 masks are not sufficient [to tackle tear gas]. There was also no special care for pregnant staff.” Although the hospital arranged staff shuttle buses to several areas, the doctor said their frequency and the number of destinations were not sufficient. Professor David Hui Shu-cheong, an expert in respiratory medicine from Chinese University, said people with diseases such as asthma or chronic bronchitis were likely to suffer more when exposed to tear gas. “Their trachea will get irritated and be more likely to develop inflammation,” Hui said. “Allergic rhinitis will also get worse.” But he believed that patients staying indoors were unlikely to be affected by tear gas outside, as public hospitals used a central air-conditioning system and did not open windows. He said that because air conditioners were usually installed on the roof of a hospital block, tear gas, which was heavier than air, was less likely to contaminate the machines. 	SCMP

Others, except for accredited journalists, were told they would be arrested once they stepped out. A police source said those who surrendered without a fight could expect lenient punishment, but all entrapped protesters had to answer to the law. With police showing no intention of storming the campus and besieged activists unwilling to give up, a stalemate ensued. Police surround Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus in stand-off with protesters Police surround Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus in stand-off with protesters Police surround Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus in stand-off with protesters Former Legislative Council president Jasper Tsang Yok-sing and University of Hong Kong legal scholar Eric Cheung Tat-ming entered the PolyU campus with a police escort at around 11pm. When asked about the visit, Tsang said he was there to “help those who want to leave”.  Earlier attempts by various groups to negotiate a peaceful solution failed. University board directors, teachers, parents and lawmakers trying to enter the campus were turned back by officers. At nightfall, thousands of the radicals’ supporters who gathered in Jordan and Tsim Sha Tsui tried to relieve the police siege by force.  They battled riot officers in the bustling streets of central Kowloon throughout the night, with tear gas and petrol bombs exchanged at rapid intervals. Those who stayed on the campus in Hung Hom also tried to break out and leave en masse. But they were quickly met by rounds of tear gas fired by police guarding several entrances.  In the evening, dozens managed to slip through the police line and escape. Under cover of night, they used ropes to descend from a campus footbridge to a highway and were picked up by motorcycles and driven away.

This came after extremely violent clashes between masked radicals occupying the campus and police on Sunday. Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, the city’s No 2 official, on Monday said the nature of the movement had changed from opposing the now-withdrawn extradition bill to “destroying Hong Kong”. Many besieged activists were teenagers or secondary school students. Their anxious parents staged a sit-in near the campus in Tsim Sha Tsui East as the stand-off showed no sign of easing.    A mother burst into tears as she searched Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Jordan looking for her son, a Form Six student. His teacher and friends earlier told her the boy had been seriously injured after taking part in the conflict at PolyU. It was not clear if he left the campus. “He was at home [on Sunday] before I went to work. I have no idea where he went but he did not come back,” she said. “He’s only 17 and he might not recover if no treatment is done. I prefer that he gets arrested than seeing him die.” The hospital said it had no record of her son’s admission.   Meanwhile, on the campus, Jasper Tsang and Eric Cheung first met a group of volunteers and some of those they had helped, and offered to leave together with them. Cheung said that while they could not guarantee the activists would not be arrested after they stepped out of the campus, he said they could ensure their personal safety. “I don’t think this retreat is a surrender. If there is any arrest, I’d also question what evidence the police have,” Cheung said. Tsang added: “I can guarantee that if we leave together, you won’t face any rough treatment.” The group later said they needed to have a discussion among themselves first. Missing chemicals from universities spark fears over public safety 19 Nov 2019 Missing chemicals from universities spark fears over public safety 19 Nov 2019 The tense stand-off at the campus has made Hong Kong the focus of the world again. A spokesman for Britain’s foreign office said London was “seriously concerned by the escalation in violence by both sides”. “It is vital that those who are injured are able to receive appropriate medical treatment, and that safe passage is made available for those who wish to leave the area,” he said, adding that all sides should engage in political dialogue to defuse the tension. Chinese ambassador to Britain Liu Xiaoming blamed protesters for unleashing “black terror” and urged British politicians to condemn calls for Hong Kong independence more forcefully. Liu said China had the “resolution and power” to end the unrest in Hong Kong, if necessary. “If the situation becomes uncontrollable, the central government certainly will not sit on our hands and watch. We have enough resolution and power to end the unrest,” he said. China had the “resolution and power” to end the unrest The stand-off also means the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, which links Hong Kong Island to Kowloon, will remain closed. It has been down for days after the radicals set fire to toll booths and overhead bridges.

By evening, however, all roads to the campus were blocked by riot police. When the hundreds of radicals on campus realised that they had been boxed in, the reality of their situation hit home. Some were panic-stricken, knowing it was now too late to get out without facing arrest for rioting, an offence that could mean 10 years behind bars. Others felt they had no choice but to dig in and press on, hurling more petrol bombs at the police. But even they knew their supplies were running low. “I am worried about my safety, but there is no way out now. I have no choice but to stay till the end,” a 20-year-old said on Sunday night, after learning that police had blocked all exits.  Radicals took over the campus days earlier. It was a disaster zone through much of Sunday evening. Loud explosions could be heard. They threw a large number of petrol bombs at police, who responded with tear gas and water cannons. Footbridges were set on fire as crowds tried to block officers. Night clashes around Hong Kong Polytechnic University Night clashes around Hong Kong Polytechnic University Night clashes around Hong Kong Polytechnic University A police armoured vehicle at a flyover next to the campus was set on fire. The driver had to put the vehicle in reverse, rumbling away from the crowd that kept pelting it with petrol bombs. At 8.30pm, police announced over Facebook that anyone who chose to stay on campus faced being arrested for rioting. An hour later, police said everyone leaving the campus had to go through Block Y of the Lee Shau Kee Building.  It did not say if those who left would be arrested.  “This is the last chance for you to come out,” an officer at Block Y shouted to those inside. Among the first to go through Block Y were some first-aid volunteers, who had earlier tried getting out via other exits, only to find them all blocked. Some journalists who were on campus also emerged. Police officers at the block ordered them all to raise their hands, get in line and walk for about five minutes to a police checkpoint. An officer at the scene shouted: “Arrest them for aiding in rioting!” Four journalists from online media and two people in paramedic vests were seen being arrested at the checkpoint. Only mainstream journalists were allowed to go. The Hong Kong Journalists’ Association then intervened and successfully lobbied police to let journalists from online media and student publications leave too. Police allowed the first-aid volunteers and journalists to leave through Science Museum Road, near Concordia Plaza. Among those who got out was a human rights observer, who was frisked and had his bag searched. Are Hong Kong’s universities becoming ‘weapons factories’ as claimed by police? 16 Nov 2019 Are Hong Kong’s universities becoming ‘weapons factories’ as claimed by police? 16 Nov 2019 “I left soon after seeing the police armoured vehicle getting hit by petrol bombs on the bridge,” said the man, who asked not to be named. It is not known if any radicals tried to leave through these two exits on Sunday night. A message spray-painted on a building said: “Some people moved on. But not us.” Overnight, those still on campus were desperately making petrol bombs. Clashes occurred sporadically, then escalated at about 5.30am on Monday when water cannons were used on radicals guarding the campus entrance on Cheong Wan Road. Police then fired multiple rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets at the mob. Riot police then suddenly charged and subdued several people. Fearing that police would storm the campus, some threw petrol bombs at the campus entrance, setting it ablaze.

Our resources are also running low. I am feeling desperate.” Wearing a yellow helmet and gas mask, a woman said: “I am prepared to be arrested. Everyone here thinks the same.” At 8am on Monday, about 100 radicals tried to leave the campus through Science Museum Road but police fired tear gas at them. Others tried in vain to get through the police cordon at Austin Road and Chatham Road South. More than 400 radicals arrested as they try to escape from university campus 19 Nov 2019 More than 400 radicals arrested as they try to escape from university campus 19 Nov 2019 About four hours later, a group of radicals ran out of the university’s main entrance on Cheong Wan Road. Police again responded with tear gas and water cannons. Several were arrested while others clambered over fences to get back inside the campus. “Half of us want to leave, half of us want to stay,” a PolyU alumnus surnamed Chan said from inside. “It’s not that we don’t want to leave, but there is no way out for us. There will be arrests whether you leave or not. We are staying behind … to buy time.” Ken Woo Kwok-wang, acting president of the PolyU student union, said there were still about 700 people inside the campus on Monday. He thought one person managed to escape in the morning. “Hong Kong police are creating a humanitarian crisis inside PolyU,” he said. “There is insufficient food and the number of injured is on the rise and the hygiene situation is getting worse. They are trying to push the students to a dead end, forcing them either to surrender or resist by putting their lives at risk.” How a Hong Kong university morphed into a base for protesters 15 Nov 2019 How a Hong Kong university morphed into a base for protesters 15 Nov 2019 There were also about 50 first-aid volunteers inside the campus. According to police, 51 people who could not provide journalist or first-aid accreditation were arrested on Sunday. Since the social unrest erupted in June, 4,491 people aged 11 to 83 have been arrested. Throughout Monday, supporters and family members of those still inside the campus were gathered nearby, waiting for news. Anxious mother Cindy Hui was worried about her 17-year-old son, but said she understood why he was staying inside. “He really wants to come out. A lot of them are really tired, but they can’t leave” Hui said, adding that those inside knew they would be arrested if they went through the exit manned by police. She revealed that she quarrelled with her son when he went to the PolyU campus last Thursday. “I told him, if you go to PolyU then don’t ever come back. I won’t bail you out,” she said. Then she added: “Maybe I should have come to get him out on Saturday. He is still my son, although he has his own way of thinking.” A mother with two daughters on campus was in tears as she said: “It has been tough raising them as a single mother. I don’t understand why the police have to suppress students this way.” Chief Superintendent Kwok Ka-chuen of the Police Public Relations Branch said the force was looking for a peaceful way to end the PolyU stand-off and get the radicals out. “If they will drop their weapons, follow police instructions and shoulder their legal responsibilities, police will not use force,” he said. At about 9pm on Monday, dozens of radicals managed to escape by abseiling down to a highway from a campus footbridge, with their window to freedom lasting only about five minutes before police sealed off the area, according to sources.

He blamed the protesters for unleashing “black terror” as he repeated Beijing’s support for Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s government. When asked whether the People’s Liberation Army might be deployed in the city, Liu replied: “They are already there in the Hong Kong garrison.

While he “appreciates” London’s opposition to Hong Kong independence, Liu said, he “would like to see a more strong condemnation on independence [from the British government].” The ambassador – who is one of the most outspoken Chinese diplomats about the affairs of the former British colony – said Beijing remained supportive of the chief executive and her team. “I would say the [Hong Kong] government tried very hard to communicate. You need to give them opportunity you need to give them time,” he said. In the press conference, Liu was also grilled on the subject of Xinjiang, where China is accused of interning a million or more Muslims in re-education camps.

Tony Lee Kar-yun, deputy operations director of the MTR Corporation, said the station, which had been closed since last Tuesday, would remain out of bounds in the near future. On Monday, trains could pass through the station for the first time in a week. The station, on the East Rail Line connecting Hung Hom and Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau, still reeks of the stench of burnt plastic. Black and brown burn marks could be seen on the destroyed turnstiles and ticketing machines, as well as on the floor. “According to the preliminary assessment of our engineering team, the station will need to undergo very deep-rooted repairs. These repairs will be similar to rebuilding the whole station,” Lee said. “Glass shards were seen everywhere [around the station] when we first arrived at the scene.” MTR stations and facilities have remained at a focal point of destruction by radical protesters since August when they accused the corporation of bowing to Beijing and siding with police. As of October 29, protesters had caused extensive damage to 85 of 94 heavy rail stations and 60 of 68 Light Rail stops, setting fires, smashing equipment and ripping out fixtures.  More than 1,600 turnstiles, 960 ticketing and add-value machines, 1,100 surveillance cameras, 125 lifts and escalators, 1,060 glass panel walls and 130 sets of roller shutters were vandalised. Since the mask ban took effect on October 5, the corporation reduced the entire network’s operating hours and even closed stations partly due to escalated and repeated damage.    Last Tuesday, the University station was vandalised when the protesters decided to paralyse the city’s key road access by blocking the Tolo Highway next to the Chinese University campus.  They wanted to force the government to meet their demands, which include universal suffrage. Transportation in the eastern and northern parts of New Territories was seriously disrupted for five days.  At the University station, the gates of one entrance had been barred shut with metal rails, bamboo poles, buckets, brooms and other debris, with the words “police and dogs cannot enter” sprawled in graffiti on the floor.

Communication facilities had also been destroyed, and lighting facilities could be seen dangling from the ceiling. The equipment of the control room inside the station had been removed, and the windows were missing. A train at University station, which had been severely damaged and burnt multiple times, was brought back to the MTR Corporation’s Ho Tung Lau depot near Fo Tan on Saturday.

The MTR Corporation sent maintenance personnel to the station on Saturday to conduct a detailed assessment of the damage and to plan how to carry out the restoration work. “The incidents over the past several days have adversely affected residents in the northern New Territories. We appeal to the parties concerned to stop vandalising railway facilities,” Lee said. “If we see any threat to the safety of our passengers and employees, we will have to suspend the service at the affected stations or sections of railway lines, which may cause further inconvenience to passengers.” 	SCMP

Post The bank told the holder of “The Prime Management Service Ltd” account last month to clear the money within 30 days, which falls this week, a banking source said on Monday. The account has been used to raise funds for Spark Alliance HK, a non-profit organisation, to support anti-government protesters by covering legal and medical services and providing aid such as food and education. The group could not be reached for comment. Bank regulations require a client to state the intended business nature of the account when opening it and its expected activities, but in this case, crowdfunding was not mentioned, according to the source.

But in reality it is being used as a platform for raising funds. This doesn’t match the account’s stated purpose,” the source said. “There has been a large amount of money going through this account every day, and the bank may have money-laundering concerns.”  The source said that if a client wanted to open an account for fundraising, it needed to be a non-profit organisation with supporting documents to show the source of funding and its governance structure.

The fund is organised by former lawmakers including Cyd Ho Sau-lan and Margaret Ng Ngoi-yee.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said that according to international standards, banks were required to “effectively assess risk” and take appropriate action regarding account activity, ensuring the consistency of their stated purpose and source of funding. “Banks should give a minimum notice of 30 days for closing its relationship with a client,” it said.

Xiamen Airlines has suspended all flights to Hong Kong International Airport, with the exception of two services a week scheduled temporarily for November. China Eastern also slashed its 56 flights from Shanghai Pudong to HKIA to 32 per week and removed all large aircraft from the route, according to flight schedule tracker service Airline Route. Hong Kong has been battered by more than five months of anti-government protests, which have often descended into violence and paralysed the city’s transport system. The demonstrations have intensified this month with radicals causing citywide carnage during working hours, an escalation of what had become the usual pattern of weekend rampages.  Last week, the city endured some of the most intense clashes between protesters and police, which continued into the start of this week. Another batch of non-Chinese Asian airlines have also decided to reduce their exposure to Hong Kong as the flight reductions become more frequent.  Garuda Indonesia will go from running 21 flights a week to just four up to mid-December. Thai Airways and Philippine Airlines are each cutting one of five daily flights per week to Hong Kong.

Police’s strategy of arresting people even without strong evidence has also led to a rise in the arrest figures, the experts said. Some 4,498 people were arrested between May 1967 and June 1968, of which 2,077 were eventually convicted for taking part in the disturbances which nearly brought the city to a standstill. On Monday afternoon, police said a total of 4,491 people had already been arrested in connection with the protests since the first anti-government rally took place on June 9. The protests, which have roiled the city for more than five months, were initially triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill but have since morphed into a wider anti-government campaign. extradition bill The 1967 riots were a spillover of the Cultural Revolution that began in mainland China a year ago, while its trigger in Hong Kong was a labour dispute at a factory in San Po Kong in April. Protesters and police in fierce clashes at Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University Protesters and police in fierce clashes at Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University Protesters and police in fierce clashes at Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University The incident escalated quickly after the leftist camp and mainland officials stationed in Hong Kong seized the opportunity to mobilise followers to protest against the colonial government.  The left wing was inspired by Beijing’s support for the “anti-British struggle”, and violence peaked when extremists started planting bombs on the city’s streets. Tensions only subsided in December 1967 when Premier Zhou Enlai expressed Beijing’s disapproval. By then, the riots had claimed 51 lives. Radicals arrested as they attempt to escape from university campus 19 Nov 2019 Radicals arrested as they attempt to escape from university campus 19 Nov 2019 Ray Yep Kin-man, a City University political scientist and an expert on the 1967 riots, said only people from the leftist camp took part in the anti-British disturbances in 1967, while people from various walks of life are involved in the ongoing protests against the administration headed by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor. Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor  “In the past two months, some arrests were made even without strong evidence,” Yep said. “I think police are adopting the strategy of arresting people to deter others from taking part in the protests.”  Yep said the force’s “dehumanisation” of protesters as “cockroaches” had helped convince some police officers of the legitimacy of unrestrained use of force. “Even during the 1967 riots, protesters were called ‘leftists’, but they were not compared with insects or animals,” he said. Lawrence Ho Ka-ki, assistant professor of social sciences at Education University of Hong Kong and an expert on policing in Hong Kong, also pointed to the fact that more people were involved in the current protests compared with those who took part in anti-British rallies in 1967.

The unpredictability of the current protests is much higher than what had happened in 1967,” he said. “I expect the number of arrests to rise steadily in the months ahead.” 	SCMP

Singapore enter the city state In a statement issued on Facebook, the consulate said there had been no change to the visa-free access policy for travellers with passports issued by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).   Only those with the HKSAR Document of Identity (DOI) – a travel document issued to Hong Kong residents unable to obtain a national passport – will need to apply for a visa, the consulate said. In addition to HKSAR DOI holders, those with a Macau Special Administrative Region travel permit – issued to non-permanent residents of the city – also have to apply for a visa to enter Singapore.  “We would like to clarify that HKSAR passport holders do not require visas to enter Singapore. The visa requirement is only necessary for HKSAR Document of Identity holders as HKSAR passports and HKSAR DOIs are different sets of travel documents,” the consulate said. Allysha Wong, a 23-year-old engineer who visits the Lion City once or twice a year, welcomed the clarification.  “I thought it was real when everyone kept forwarding messages about the new Singapore visa law for HK passport holders. It would seriously be such a hassle to get a visa every time I visit Singapore and hard to do spontaneous trips. What a relief,” she said.

Li, who is a Hong Kong passport holder, has a trip to the city state booked for December, and was anxious over the possibility of having to apply for a visa. “Singapore is a popular destination for Hongkongers because it is near, clean, and family-friendly,” she said, pointing out that an added administrative procedure might make Hong Kong passport holders think twice about planning a trip to the Lion City. However, John Hu, founder and principal consultant of John Hu Migration Consulting, disagreed.  According to Hong Kong’s Immigration Department, 166 countries and territories have granted visa-free access or visa-on-arrival to HKSAR passport holders. In Singapore, Hong Kong passport holders can stay for 30 days.

Asean defence ministers’ meeting It was the first time the two defence chiefs had spoken face-to-face about Hong Kong. They had discussed the ongoing unrest in the city in a phone conversation on November 5. As hundreds of masked radicals and police officers remained locked in an intense stand-off on Monday, Wu said the Hong Kong public had welcomed the unexpected appearance of about 50 Chinese soldiers, unarmed and in plain clothes, for the first time in more than five months of unrest in the city. stand-off Police surround Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus in stand-off with protesters Police surround Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus in stand-off with protesters Police surround Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus in stand-off with protesters “Stopping violence and restoring order is the most urgent task for Hong Kong,” Wu said.

The legislation, which has yet to pass the Senate, requires the United States to sanction people who are responsible for the erosion of autonomy in Hong Kong.   “More importantly, the diplomatic channel between Beijing and Washington is being obstructed, so this message is not just to Esper personally, but to the whole Trump administration,” he said. He said that because of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s extreme hawkish stance against China, contact between Pompeo and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was limited.  The meeting between two the defence ministers was a rare chance to address this issue, which China sees as touching upon its sovereignty and national security.

Two High Court judges on Monday ruled that the emergency legislation that brought the ban on face coverings in public places into effect last month was “incompatible with the Basic Law” when used in times of public danger as seen in the present case. They also found the new law had imposed invalid restrictions on fundamental rights and freedoms. The ruling by justices Anderson Chow Ka-ming and Godfrey Lam Wan-ho, in favour of the 25 pan-democrats who applied for judicial review, dealt a blow to the beleaguered city government. Police announced they would stop enforcing the ban for now, while prosecutors sought adjournment “to consider the situation”. Legal experts were divided, some calling the judgment an important recognition of Hong Kong’s constitutional framework, while those on the mainland expressed concerns that the court might have sent the wrong signal to the radical protesters, floating the idea of Beijing interpreting the Basic Law again. The judges will hear further submissions on Wednesday morning to decide the appropriate relief and costs. The high-profile constitutional challenge centred on the colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance and its derivative, the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation, introduced by the government on the grounds of “public danger” in a bid to quell a wave of protests sparked nearly six months ago by the now-withdrawn extradition bill.  In a 106-page ruling handed down on Monday afternoon, the judges made clear it was not their judgment that an anti-mask law was, in general, objectionable or unconstitutional. The judges also accepted that the government’s present ban was rationally connected to its aim of eliminating the emboldening effect of wearing masks and facilitating law enforcement, investigation and prosecution.  But they sided with the applicants in finding that the ordinance had effectively given the chief executive “the widest possible” powers to make laws with no limit on the subject matter, whenever desirable in times of public danger that could mean a wide range of scenarios, leaving the legislature with a diminished role. Protesters gather to mark one month since mask ban was introduced Protesters gather to mark one month since mask ban was introduced Protesters gather to mark one month since mask ban was introduced “The need for an urgent response is no justification for departing from or impugning the constitutional scheme,” the judges wrote. “We believe [the ordinance] is not compatible with the constitutional order laid down by the Basic Law.”  The judges also found that the regulation had effectively imposed “a near-blanket prohibition” across unlawful assemblies, peaceful public meetings and processions where participants could have “perfectly legitimate reasons for not wishing to be identified or seen to be supporting [certain] causes”. And in empowering any police officer to remove any kind of facial covering so long as they reasonably believe it likely to prevent identification, the regulation “represents a more serious inroad into protected rights than is reasonably necessary”, the judges concluded. Mask ban unconstitutional say lawmakers, as they ask court to overturn law 31 Oct 2019 Mask ban unconstitutional say lawmakers, as they ask court to overturn law 31 Oct 2019 “The restriction imposed by the [regulation] is … not to be trivialised as a minor inhibition on mask-wearing during demonstrations but, depending on the context, can have a significant impact on the freedom of expression in peaceful public meetings and processions,” they continued. “We consider it to be clear that the measure adopted … exceeds what is reasonably necessary to achieve the aim of law enforcement, investigation and prosecution of violent protesters even in the prevailing turbulent circumstances in Hong Kong.” But the judges left open the question of whether the ordinance is constitutional when used in times of emergency. As of Thursday, some 632 people had been arrested for violating the regulation, according to police statistics obtained by the Post. Post Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said the government was studying the court ruling. “The judgment today is not the end of the judicial process,” Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu said. He declined to comment on whether he should bear any responsibility for not ensuring that the anti-mask law was legally watertight. Former lawmaker “Long Hair” Leung Kwok-hung said his legal challenge exposed Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s abuse of power. Hong Kong mask law enacted to ‘save as many young people as possible’ 1 Nov 2019 Hong Kong mask law enacted to ‘save as many young people as possible’ 1 Nov 2019 “I don’t want to comment on whether I have obtained victory or the government had been defeated,” he told reporters outside court. “All I have in mind is the people surrounded by police.” Another applicant, legal sector lawmaker Dennis Kwok, urged the authorities not to appeal against the ruling and called on prosecutors to withdraw charges. The regulation barred anyone from wearing “facial coverings” during public assemblies that were “likely to prevent identification”, with those convicted facing up to one year in jail and a HK$25,000 (US$3,187) fine. It also gave police officers the power to require a person to remove his or her mask in a public place. Those failing to comply would have their masks removed by officers under an offence carrying a maximum prison sentence of six months and a fine of HK$10,000. The controversial move sparked six constitutional challenges, including the present two, with the remaining four applicants directed to await the outcome of these proceedings. At Kwun Tong Court, the first two people charged over the ban saw their cases put on hold after Senior Public Prosecutor Ivan Cheung Cheuk-kan asked for time to “consider the situation”. Acting principal magistrate Ivy Chui Yee-mei granted the application, adjourning the case to January 17. Senior Superintendent Li Kwai-wah of the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau said the force would stop using the anti-mask law to arrest people in light of the ruling. He said that there had only been three cases in which officers made arrests solely on suspicion of violating the ban since it came into effect on October 5. “Only one had been prosecuted and the case is still pending court hearing. We shall discuss with the Department of Justice what to do,” Li said. Simon Young Ngai-man, law scholar at the University of Hong Kong, said the judgment had affirmed the importance of the separation of powers and fundamental freedoms in the city, and helped restore the authority of the Legislative Council as the primary lawmaking institution under the Basic Law. In rare move, two judges appointed to hear legal bids against mask ban 17 Oct 2019 In rare move, two judges appointed to hear legal bids against mask ban 17 Oct 2019 “It’s an important victory for the recognition of separate legislative power after 1997,” Young said. “In the current political climate, it is of vital importance to reaffirm Legco’s authority, as it should be the central political institution to debate and mediate the conflicting interests in society.” Ronny Tong Ka-wah SC, a member of the Executive Council, the government’s top advisory body, said the court had delivered “a very important judgment on constitutional order in Hong Kong”, but it was debatable whether the ordinance had indeed conferred too much power upon the chief executive, and whether the Chief Executive in Council had bypassed the legislature by invoking it. Some mainland legal specialists said the court’s ruling could send the wrong signal to radicals and deal a blow to the government’s efforts to stop the violence. Whether Beijing would step in could rest on the outcome of a likely appeal by the government, they said. “One option is for the National People’s Congress to issue an interpretation of the Basic Law. It could help clear the confusion and safeguard Hong Kong’s legal system,” Nankai University law professor Li Xiaobing said. “But it also has to take into account whether such an interpretation would be accepted by Hong Kong’s legal community. “Whether it will prompt the NPC to interpret the Basic Law would hinge on the ensuing legal proceedings, including the outcome of the [expected] appeal at the Court of Final Appeal.” Beihang University law professor Tian Feilong noted that the ruling was not final and the government could still appeal. But he said the High Court’s decision did not reassure critics on the mainland who had already questioned the court’s lenient bail conditions for suspects arrested during the unrest. “The judgment could prompt the NPC Standing Committee to initiate the interpretation process to supervise and guide Hong Kong courts in correctly understanding [the relationship] between the Basic Law and the Emergency Regulations Ordinance,” Tian said. Meanwhile, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid under People’s Daily, said that Monday’s ruling would demoralise the police force and encourage public sympathy towards hard-core radicals. Global Times People’s Daily “Many people will see the ruling as the High Court’s accommodation of everything committed by these masked rioters,” Hu wrote in a Weibo post.

He will be the first commissioner of police in 175 years to leave without ceremonial fanfare or a Mess Night, the traditional farewell dinner with senior officers and guests. For a man who served 35 years, reaching the top of a 31,000-strong force long regarded as one of the finest in the world, it will be a quiet exit. “There is simply nothing worth celebrating at this moment, as the city is on the brink of a total breakdown,” a senior police source who works closely with the chief told the Post. “The sentiment in the force is not that good. Lo wants to keep a low profile.” on the brink of a total breakdown Post There is simply nothing worth celebrating at this moment, as the city is on the brink of a total breakdown Senior police source Lo, who turns 58 on Tuesday, will hand over duties to his deputy Chris Tang Ping-keung, at a time of crisis in Hong Kong, plummeting morale among the rank and file, and deepening public distrust of police. Chris Tang Ping-keung Increasingly violent anti-government protests, now in their sixth month, have led to the arrest of more than 4,000 people. Unending accusations of brutality have been hurled at police, including allegations that people have been mistreated after arrest. Police chief steps back from riot label as Carrie Lam keeps low profile Police chief steps back from riot label as Carrie Lam keeps low profile 18 Jun 2019 About 1,600 people have been injured in clashes, including 400 officers.  Pan-democrats are harshest in assessing Lo’s 4½ years as commander, calling him “the worst police chief ever”. They blame him for alleged brutality of officers at the front lines of the protests, and for leaving the force’s reputation in tatters. Security veteran and pan-democratic lawmaker James To Kun-sun said that under Lo, “police act like kings”.  “Officers beat up whoever they don’t like almost every day. They have been uncontrollable under Lo’s command,” he said. “It’s a joke that the top cop has failed to control his own officers. Lo’s leadership has been disastrous.” Others came to Lo’s defence.  Pro-Beijing lawmaker Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, vice-chairman of the watchdog Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC), said Lo could take some credit for Hong Kong’s low crime rate. Under his command, the city’s crime rate fell for the 12th consecutive year last year, achieving a 48-year low. The 54,225 crimes reported last year were 3.2 per cent lower than the previous year. “Hong Kong was crowned a safe city over the past few years,” Cheung said. “It is just very unfortunate for Lo to be caught in the storm at this moment.” Police recruiting ‘special cops’ to ease Hong Kong protest burden: sources 13 Nov 2019 Police recruiting ‘special cops’ to ease Hong Kong protest burden: sources 13 Nov 2019 The senior police source disagreed with To’s withering assessment, saying: “The criticism is not fair because whoever headed the force during this unprecedented challenging period would have yielded the same result. It is not Lo’s particular faults that turned the city into a battlefield.” The source added that within the force, Lo has been a caring chief. “He is a kind man who cares about his staff member’s feelings. He never sells his men out,” the source said. “But, of course, you can ask if a kind man, who does not rule with an iron fist, is a good leader in terms of law and order. “I can only say he headed the force well at a time of peace.” Lo made what was possibly his last official appearance on November 16, when he attended a passing-out parade of probationary inspectors and recruit police constables at the Hong Kong Police College. He encouraged the officers to hold firm to their values, stay honest, above-board and confident, to rise to the challenges of dealing with the threats to public safety and order in the current social unrest. “My heart is always with the force. It is my greatest honour to be able to lead this world-class professional police force,” he said. Sorry is the hardest word Sorry is the hardest word Lo took the top job in 2015, as Hong Kong was recovering from the Occupy protests of 2014 which saw parts of the city crippled for 79 days. Occupy protests of 2014 Meeting reporters at the time, he said he would apologise for any wrongdoings of the force. His tenure was marked from the start by incidents which left the force looking bad, resulting in demands for apologies. Policeman who shot protester ‘did not deviate from guidelines’ 13 Nov 2019 Policeman who shot protester ‘did not deviate from guidelines’ 13 Nov 2019 Just days after he took over, police had to express regret for the wrongful arrest in May 2015 of a 31-year-old man with moderate intellectual disabilities. The man was charged with manslaughter over the death of a 73-year-old man in Sha Tin, but the charge was dropped within hours because he had an alibi. He had been locked up for 50 hours without his medication. Angry critics accused police of lacking the training to handle intellectually disabled suspects. As the new chief, Lo also had to deal with the fallout from police handling of the Occupy movement, as eight officers were taken to court for assaulting protesters. In February 2017, seven officers were convicted of beating up Occupy activist Ken Tsang Kin-chiu. They were jailed for 2½ years each, although the courts subsequently freed two officers and reduced the others’ sentences. The conviction prompted the four police associations to organise a mass rally on February 22, 2017, to protest against the court ruling. Tens of thousands of serving and former officers and their supporters turned up and during the rally, an officer went on stage and declared that police were being victimised, likening those who suffered at the hands of the Nazis in the second world war. The German and Israeli consulates objected strongly to that comparison, and senior police officers scrambled to meet the consulate staff and mend relations. scrambled to meet In another case, former superintendent Frankly Chu was sentenced to three months’ jail in 2017 for striking a bystander with a baton during the Occupy protests. He lost his final appeal in January this year. sentenced to three months’ jail Lo refused to apologise for the wrongdoings of his subordinates in both cases. Instead, he appealed to the public to understand the tremendous pressure police were under during the protests. ‘Human targets’ in Mong Kok ‘Human targets’ in Mong Kok If police handling of the Occupy movement weakened the relationship between the force and Hongkongers, the 2016 Lunar New Year season delivered a fresh blow. A crackdown on illegal street vendors in Mong Kok in February that year turned into the worst riots in the city in decades, with ugly clashes between police and protesters. worst riots in the city in decades Over two days, rioting protesters hurled bricks at police and started fires. More than 80 people were arrested, and more than 90 officers injured. In that incident, it was police officers themselves who were upset with the force’s handling of the riot. There was widespread anger among their ranks, with members accusing top brass of responding too feebly. On social media, frontline officers demanded why they were left exposed as human targets as rioters threw bricks at them. They asked why no anti-riot weapons, including tear gas, were used. Some also questioned if Lo, who appeared “soft” to the public, was capable of safeguarding the pride and dignity of the force. Lo is not known for robust responses to reporters’ questions in the wake of criticism when controversies arise. He tended to deliver stock replies, expressing sadness at whatever happened, while urging the public to understand the conditions under which officers work, saying they were just following standard procedure, or acting in good faith. Police express ‘displeasure’ over journalists’ protest in letter to media 8 Nov 2019 Police express ‘displeasure’ over journalists’ protest in letter to media 8 Nov 2019 ‘Not seen on the front line’ ‘Not seen on the front line’ If frontline officers grumbled after the Mong Kok riot that they were left exposed as human targets, the much-repeated complaint this year is that police responded too aggressively to protesters. Since the anti-government protests began in June, police have fired more than 9,000 rounds of tear gas, 4,300 rubber bullets, nearly 1,000 sponge grenades and 1,000 beanbag rounds, as well as 14 live rounds. If the police response has been excessive, Law Yuk-kai, director of the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor, blames Lo. “He terminated a professional body and turned it into a shameful one,” Law said. “He can relax the guidelines on the use of weapons in the blink of an eye, making it more convenient for officers to use excessive force on protesters. They can even carry pepper spray and batons while off-duty.” Pro-establishment lawmaker Tony Tse Wai-chuen, deputy chairman of the IPCC, pointed out that Lo had cooperated with the watchdog which is studying the current protests. “During his term, the force also adopted a number of recommendations that we made,” Tse said. Tse acknowledged that Lo had a challenging tenure, from the Mong Kok riots to this year’s protests which have been “much more complicated and serious than the challenges faced by his predecessor”. However, he felt that Lo was not supportive enough of his officers on the front lines. How embattled police force is holding city back from the brink against all odds 19 Aug 2019 How embattled police force is holding city back from the brink against all odds 19 Aug 2019 “Many frontline officers have not seen their chief standing together with them,” he said. He also faulted Lo for providing inadequate explanations of police actions. “Many Hongkongers cannot understand the rationale behind some police operations,” he said. Joe Chan Cho-kwong, a retired station sergeant and former chairman of the Junior Police Officers’ Association, worked closely with Lo after he became the top cop. He said Lo listened to the police associations, and supported efforts to improve benefits and welfare for officers, including working hours and equipment upgrades. But Chan said he did not agree with the force’s operational tactics since Lo became chief. “Their strategies have not advanced with the times. I do not see any improvement,” he said, declining to elaborate. Asked how he rated Lo as a top commander, Chan thought for more than a minute before saying: “I really cannot find an appropriate word for him. I am out of words.” Additional reporting by Tony Cheung Additional reporting by Tony Cheung 	SCMP

It has been two months since a coalition of airlines wrote to the authorities pleading for help, including waivers of airport fees and charges. “So far, we haven’t heard back from the government,” Ronald Lam Siu-por, Cathay Pacific’s chief customer and commercial officer, told analysts at a closed-door meeting last Thursday. Lam is chairman of the Board of Airline Representatives (BAR), which acts for more than 70 airlines flying to Hong Kong, and wrote the letter to the authorities saying many airlines had reduced or cut services as declining passenger numbers made many routes unprofitable. On the group’s wish list were adjustments to airport landing and parking fees, as well as lower rentals for offices and lounges. But the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) has made clear that no relief measures are being planned for airlines.  Responding last Friday to queries, it indicated that it preferred finding ways to woo travellers to use Hong Kong’s airport, including transit passengers who might go duty-free shopping there. It said it collaborated with business partners in September and October to roll out two rounds of promotional activities, and more were in the pipeline for the coming months. coming months. It did not provide details of the promotions, or the response to the first round.  In September alone, Hong Kong Airport passenger traffic fell by 710,000 to 4.85 million, compared to 5.56 million in the same month last year. There were 802,000 fewer travellers using the airport in October, some 13 per cent down compared with the same month last year. .  There were 74.5 million travellers who used HKIA last year. This year’s figure is likely to fall by 2 million, according to the airport operator’s estimates Cathay not planning to ground planes or offer unpaid leave amid protest woes 14 Nov 2019 Cathay not planning to ground planes or offer unpaid leave amid protest woes 14 Nov 2019 A spokeswoman for the Transport and Housing Bureau indicated there are plans to woo travellers to Hong Kong, but did not give details of the initiatives. Over the two months since Lam sent his letter, airline schedule data indicates that about 3 million seats to Hong Kong have been removed from sale. According to flight schedule tracker Airline Route, around a dozen international carriers have cancelled or reduced services, including Air Canada, Emirates, United Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Singapore Airlines and Asiana Airlines. On Friday, Airline Route said 10 mainland Chinese carriers have slashed services to Hong Kong since last month, including China Eastern which reduced Shanghai Pudong-Hong Kong flights from 56 to 32 a week until the end of March 2020. Cathay Pacific further lowers profit forecast as aviation summit cancelled 13 Nov 2019 Cathay Pacific further lowers profit forecast as aviation summit cancelled 13 Nov 2019 The Cathay Pacific Group, the largest airline at HKIA, has seen passenger traffic fall for three consecutive months up to October. Australia’s Qantas last month blamed Hong Kong’s unrest for denting its profits by HK$134.1 million. Airport charges accounted for 27 per cent of the Airport Authority’s income in the 2018/19 financial year, its annual report showed. Since 2016, landing charges have risen every year to help authorities pay for the HK$141.5 billion third runway expansion. 	SCMP

The two sides have been involved in an increasingly intense conflict at Polytechnic University since Sunday, with radicals shooting police with arrows, using catapults to launch rockets and petrol bombs, and setting fire to buildings and bridges. Live: Radicals and Hong Kong police remain locked in campus stand-off 19 Nov 2019 Live: Radicals and Hong Kong police remain locked in campus stand-off 19 Nov 2019 Following a day of fierce battles in Hung Hom, police on Sunday ordered everyone to leave the school campus or risk “taking part in a riot”, an offence punishable by 10 years in prison. But dozens of people who left the school, including first aiders, were immediately arrested. Police surround Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus in stand-off with protesters Police surround Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus in stand-off with protesters Police surround Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus in stand-off with protesters They also warned rioters to stop using petrol bombs, arrows, cars or other lethal weapons to attack police, or officers would use “minimum force” – including live rounds – in response. On Monday morning, some managed to escape at around 8am, but others were forced back into the campus buildings. Police sealed off key roads and approaches to the university, preventing anyone from going in or out.  At the nearby Urban Council Centenary Garden, riot police repeatedly dispersed and ran after onlookers who refused to leave, and pepper sprayed those that did not move. At least seven people were detained and led away by police, with a least one suffering a head injury. The day began with the intense stand-off between protesters and police officers continuing, with demonstrators vowing to stage traffic disruptions across in the city. Clashes that occurred sporadically overnight escalated at about 5.30am when riot police appeared to try to enter the campus. Clashes that occurred sporadically overnight  Radicals were seen setting fire to the school’s main entrance on Cheong Wan Road and hurling petrol bombs from above officers, who fired multiple rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets from the rooftop of the adjacent Hong Kong Museum of History.  A man was seen being removed from the university campus by a first aider on a stretcher. Earlier, police confirmed in a Facebook post that three live rounds had been fired in Tsim Sha Tsui at around 3am on Monday when a “mob of rioters” assaulted officers and helped a 20-year old Chinese female protester escape custody. Police said the woman, who had suffered a head injury, had been arrested for unlawful assembly at the junction of Nathan Road and Jordan Road, and was being taken to hospital by a police escort when they were attacked.   The force said a group of masked people threw bricks and splashed an unidentified liquid on the officers. One officer, who faced “grave danger and threat to his life”, fired three shots from his service revolver, but police do not believe anyone was hit. “Police express utmost condemnation in the rioters’ flagitious act of assaulting police officers and aiding the arrested person to escape,” the statement read, adding the arrested person was now “wanted” by police. “We stress that ‘assisting an offender’ is a serious offence and the maximum sentence upon conviction after trial is 10 years of imprisonment.” Night clashes around Hong Kong Polytechnic University Night clashes around Hong Kong Polytechnic University Night clashes around Hong Kong Polytechnic University At about 7am, hard-core protesters occupying the podium at the university’s main entrance stopped firefighters from putting out the blaze, while throwing objects into it to keep it burning. One was heard telling his peers that riot police would rush in once the fire was extinguished. But in a statement, police said it was totally false to suggest they had “raided” the premises on Monday morning, claiming they were only continuing their “dispersal and arrest operation”. They said “a large gang of rioters” had gathered at Cheong Wan Road since midnight, where they hurled petrol bombs, and caused fires in which multiple explosions were also heard. “Fire were observed in various locations in the PolyU premises. Explosives, flammable substances and dangerous goods also pose threats to anyone therein,” the statement read. “Police appeal to everyone inside the campus to leave immediately.” In a pre-recorded video sent to the media after police tried to storm the campus, PolyU president Teng Jinguang called on the radicals to leave. “I have been communicating closely with the police since last evening,” he said. “We have now received an assurance from the police of a temporary suspension of the use of force under the condition that, if the protesters do not initiate the use of force, the police would not initiate the use of force. “In addition, we have also received permission from the police for you to leave the campus peacefully.” Teng said he would “personally accompany” anyone who left to the police station to ensure their cases would be fairly processed, adding the university’s office of counselling and wellness would also provide the necessary support to its students.

Some also responded to calls to head to Hung Hom to rescue their peers in PolyU. Train services between Hung Hom and Mong Kok East stations on the East Rail line have been suspended by the city’s railway operator. 	SCMP

Part of the Western Theatre Command, which oversees a vast area in the west of China, including Xinjiang and Tibet, Xuefeng – according to earlier reports by the PLA Daily, the mouthpiece of China’s military – is one of the country’s leading counterterrorism brigades. PLA Daily China’s military Chinese soldiers and residents help clear streets after a week of intense protest in Hong Kong Chinese soldiers and residents help clear streets after a week of intense protest in Hong Kong Chinese soldiers and residents help clear streets after a week of intense protest in Hong Kong In 2010, its troops took part in a joint counterterrorism drill in a mountainous region of northern Pakistan, close to the border with Afghanistan. The exercise involved a range of scenarios, including dealing with hostage situations. The brigade is also trained to be able to deal with a wide range of environments, including deserts and open plains, and have travelled to South America and Europe, the reports said.  In 2013, its Eighth Company won the gold medal during a “confrontation exercise” at the Zhurihe military training base in Inner Mongolia. Troops from the brigade last week featured in a report on the military channel of China’s state broadcaster CCTV, in which they were seen searching for objects in rooms filled with tear gas, and without the aid of face masks.      The garrison conducted a routine rotation in August amid the ongoing protests and violent clashes in the city. However, unlike previous rotations, the exercise was not accompanied by an official announcement stating that the amount of troops and equipment stationed in the city was unchanged. Macau-based military expert Anthony Wong said the involvement of troops from the Hong Kong garrison in Saturday’s clean-up operation could be seen as sending multiple messages to multiple audiences.  As well as being a straightforward reminder of mainland China’s military presence – including elite counterterrorism forces – in the city, the act served as a show of support to the beleaguered pro-government camp and as a gentle warning to violent radicals, he said. But the giveaway basketball jerseys also raised questions, Wong said. “[Xuefeng] is from west China, so are they supposed to be in town? Did they arrive during the rotation?” Or was the whole incident just a way to test the waters, he asked. “When they come out of their barracks next time, it’s possible they might walk a couple of blocks further.” 	SCMP

That came after an extremely violent day that saw the two sides battling each other around the strategically located campus in Kowloon. At 10pm, a white Ford sedan without licence plates tried to ram a group of police officers just outside the Gun Club Hill barracks on Austin Road. An officer fired one live round at the vehicle and another one shot it with a rubber bullet. The car stopped and then took off towards Tsim Sha Tsui, police said. The normally serene neighbourhood around the campus on Austin Road turned into a war zone, with masked radicals occupying PolyU waging pitched battles against riot police. Protesters and police in fierce clashes at Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University Protesters and police in fierce clashes at Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University Protesters and police in fierce clashes at Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University A police source said dozens of people had been arrested at the campus, and hundreds of others were estimated to be inside. Mass arrests were expected. Police said that most of the dangerous materials they had seized from arrested radicals over the past few days were stolen from PolyU laboratories.  The materials were highly flammable and could be used to make explosives. Police said it was one of the reasons they had to take back the occupied campus. Both sides stepped up their use of violence. The radicals shot arrows and hurled petrol bombs and bricks – sometimes from catapults mounted on the roof of campus buildings. Police fired a large quantity of tear gas and deployed two water cannons and armoured vehicles. Amid the chaos, a 39-year-old sergeant handling media liaison was injured by an arrow, which pierced the inner back of his left leg and almost came out the other side. He later received surgery to have the arrow head removed.  At the time of publishing, the fighting had raged for more than 12 hours.  At nightfall, the battleground shifted to the other side of the campus near the blocked Cross-Harbour Tunnel at Hung Hom. Two sides battled to gain control of a strategically located footbridge overlooking the highways to the tunnel. The footbridge also connects the Hung Hom railway station to the campus. Radical protesters first put up bricks to slow the police advance. Later they set flammable material and other debris on the footbridge ablaze, sparking a huge bonfire and causing several explosions. The whole footbridge burned uncontrollably, with dense clouds of smoke billowing from it. Blazing debris was seen falling on the highway below. Firefighters managed to put the blaze out after about 30 minutes. But the radicals soon torched another flyover that ran parallel to the footbridge and was even closer to the mouth of the tunnel. A police armoured vehicle sent to take the flyover was attacked by a rioting crowd and set on fire. The driver had to put the vehicle in reverse, rumbling away from radicals who kept pelting petrol bombs at it. It was not immediately clear if anyone was injured. Police on Sunday night issued a statement describing what happened at PolyU as a riot. “Anyone who enters or stays on the campus and assists the rioters in any way will risk committing the offence of ‘taking part in a riot’,’’ the statement said. It asked people staying on the campus to leave. Police set up checkpoints and would only allow people to leave through a designated exit. All of them, including journalists, coming from the campus had their bags searched. This caused tension between police and some reporters. The police public relations branch had warned that anyone who left the campus without press credentials would be arrested, according to the Hong Kong Journalists Association. The identity of the masked radicals remained unclear, but many were apparently outsiders who had no real connection with the university. PolyU issued a statement condemning the behaviour of those occupying the campus and urged them to leave immediately. “The PolyU campus has been occupied by activists and has been severely and extensively vandalised over the past few days. The unlawful activities and acts of violence inside the campus and in its vicinity have been escalating, including damage to a number of laboratories on campus with the dangerous chemicals inside being taken away,” it said. It called on all its teaching staff and administrators to persuade students who were still staying in the campus to leave. “We understand that our students are very concerned about the current social issues. However, in striving for one’s goal, one must always act with calmness and rationality,” it said. Sunday’s rampage was in sharp contrast with Saturday, when hundreds of volunteers and local residents came out to clear roadblocks. They managed to clear most of the roads with only some minor skirmishes with radicals. By Sunday, PolyU was the last stronghold occupied by the masked radicals following a week of escalating violence. The Cross-Harbour Tunnel linking Hong Kong Island to Kowloon had been blocked since Wednesday night – the longest forced closure in its history. Its toll booths were torched and debris strewn all over the vehicle lanes. On Sunday morning, dozens of volunteers tried to clear roadblocks on Austin Road near the northern part of the PolyU campus. But they met stiff resistance as a group of masked men hurled bricks at the unarmed volunteers. Police arrived but they were met with petrol bombs. Soon rounds of tear gas were fired and the conflict quickly escalated. In front of Rosary Church and the Gun Club Hill barracks of the People’s Liberation Army, riot police and masked protesters waged battles. Police called in two water cannon trucks and two armoured vehicles and made several attempts to breach the radicals’ defence line. Each time they were met with stiff resistance. The protesters scattered sharp spikes and bricks on the ground. From the commanding height of the campus rooftop, they thwarted the police advance with a hail of petrol bombs and projectiles. Among those on the front line of the confrontation was salon worker Tsang, 20, who pledged to stay until the bitter end – meaning police storming in and arresting him. “Of course I am worried about my safety. But we have sacrificed a lot already, with so many protesters having been arrested. We just can’t stop,” he said. “I know the risk. But I am not leaving.” Clashes have mostly been concentrated on the Kowloon side of the city, apart from the main battleground of Hung Hom around PolyU, Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei also saw confrontations. The Hong Kong side was quieter. The University of Hong Kong issued a statement saying conditions around its main campus and Centennial campus had improved, but the damage to facilities would take some time to repair. It advised staff to work from home if possible and avoid the university. The university said it would set up identity checks at entrances and exits to all of its campuses, and at building entrances. Baptist University also put in place similar controls. The Education Bureau has announced that classes at all schools in Hong Kong would continue to be suspended on Monday.

The unlawful activities and acts of violence inside the campus and in its vicinity have been escalating, including damage to a number of laboratories on campus with the dangerous chemicals inside being taken away. All classes have been forced to be suspended and all operations on the campus have been halted. The University is gravely concerned that the spiralling radical illicit activities will cause not only a tremendous safety threat on campus, but also class suspension over an indefinite period of time. Once again, we plead with all people on campus, including students and staff members, to leave immediately. We understand that our students are very concerned about the current social issues. However, in striving for one’s goal, one must always act with calmness and rationality. Using violence or other radical means will not resolve problems, and instead it will cause a breach of the peace in our society, as well as traffic disruption. PolyU is the second home for our students, teachers and alumni, who have put painstaking efforts into building it up with the generous support from the community over the past eight decades. We are all heart-broken and in deep distress to witness the severe devastation of this home. We believe that most of the alumni, staff and students of the PolyU, as well as their relatives and friends, are deeply saddened to see the campus and the nearby areas completely wrecked, the traffic disrupted, and the University indefinitely closed. They are concerned about the safety on the campus, and they do not want to see the campus being destroyed further. We sincerely urge our students to stand together with us in cherishing and guarding themselves as well as this campus that we call home. We appeal again for all to stay calm and rational and say “No” to violence. Do not engage in any violent or unlawful activities. In this moment of utmost risk, stay away from any danger and always be vigilant in protecting yourselves to relieve our, as well as your friends’ and relatives’ worries about you. We have called on Deans, Department Heads and teachers to persuade our students to leave the campus as soon as possible. We also appeal to the parents and friends of the students to make efforts in doing likewise. Universities are venues for advancing knowledge and nurturing talents. Universities are not battlegrounds for political disputes and should not be drawn into violent confrontations. PolyU strongly condemns the occupation of the campus by the people who commit acts of violence and demands that they leave immediately. In this difficult time, we again call on all parties in society to maintain calm and restraint. We also plead with the members of PolyU to stand together. With our concerted efforts, we hope the campus can return to peace and tranquillity soon, and the impasse and turbulence in the society will come to an end.
