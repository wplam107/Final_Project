Although HKIA has made huge investments, notably on a HK$144 billion (US$18.46 billion) third runway, the Hong Kong Airport Authority’s executive director for engineering and technology Ricky Leung Wing-kee on Thursday shrugged off the downturn in passenger traffic. Leung, in his first day on the job, was speaking as the airport showed off its new HK$1 billion “skybridge” to link two terminal buildings – an upgrade that has been two years in the making. “The fluctuation in short-term passenger numbers does not affect investment in long-term infrastructure,” Leung told a media briefing. The bridge will connect the main terminal building and the north satellite concourse. Photo; Shutterstock The bridge will connect the main terminal building and the north satellite concourse.

Lee Wing-ho, 22, applied for a judicial review seeking that the High Court declare magistrates acted unlawfully in granting the warrants, and breached his constitutional right to freedom and privacy of communication. In a writ filed on Monday, Lee claimed the warrants were too general, effectively authorising “any police officer to search and seize the entire digital contents of [his] mobile phone … without any limitation or conditions whatsoever imposed”. “The magistrates have … failed to carry out the judicial gatekeeping function,” his writ read, adding that the subsequent police action to access the contents of his devices was an “oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action”. Lee was arrested for unlawful assembly on Nathan Road during an anti-government protest in Mong Kok on August 3 last year. Upon his arrest, officers seized property including his mobile phone and some digital storage cards. He did not find out warrants had been issued for police to access his devices until October 23, when his case was about to go to court.	SCMP
