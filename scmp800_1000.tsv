What does it mean for the future?	Hong Kong’s High Court on Wednesday rejected a bid by a Chinese University student leader to bar police from entering the campus. The application was filed on Tuesday, the second day of clashes between protesters and police on the scenic campus on the coast of Tolo Harbour. Officers fired more than 1,000 rounds of tear gas and deployed a water cannon in response to protesters’ petrol bomb attacks. The court’s ruling that police had the right to enter the campus to enforce the law sent alarm bells ringing through the academic community. Previously, it had been the understanding of students and staff of universities that their campuses were private places and police would enter only to respond to an emergency call, or with a search warrant.

The students believed police could not enter their campus, their “second home”, arguing that Chinese University was on private land leased by the government until 2047. Their lawyer, former lawmaker Audrey Eu Yuet-mee, cited the Police Force Ordinance and said officers could only enter if officers could identify suspects and needed to go in to make arrests, or were granted access by the school or the court with a warrant.

What protesting Hong Kong youth need is not national education But I fear that his final suggestion, that “the government should think about reinventing and centralising this training”, might not be particularly helpful. First of all, the central government is likely to take the same view of any media literacy classes that the pro-Beijing camp has of liberal studies. liberal studies To encourage the young to think for themselves could make them think in ways that contradict the government’s position. It could also, as Lai says, disabuse them of certain false rumours about the government, but is Zhongnanhai in the mood to take risks? The least risky way to implement training in media literacy training would simply be to make it training in media “illiteracy”: Ta Kung Pao should be consulted every day, the Post and Ming Pao are not to be trusted, and Hong Kong Free Press and Stand News are run by the CIA.
