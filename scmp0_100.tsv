But some lawyers and legislators on Wednesday accused officers of nonetheless abusing the public health crisis, by having the metal strips removed from arrested demonstrators’ surgical masks, saying they were dangerous. From Sunday, groups of more than four have been banned in public, as the city tries to curb the spread of Covid-19, which by Wednesday had infected 765 people locally, with four related deaths. The practicality of the measures was tested when anti-government protesters gathered at Prince Edward MTR station to mark seven months since a controversial clearance operation there, during intense unrest which has gripped the city since June last year. Rumours have led some to believe police killed protesters during a clearance operation at the station on August 31 last year, despite repeated official denials and a lack of any evidence. anti-government protesters gathered at Prince Edward MTR station intense unrest which has gripped the city since June last year Hong Kong police put social-distancing rules to test at protesters’ monthly gathering Hong Kong police put social-distancing rules to test at protesters’ monthly gathering Many demonstrators on Tuesday left after leaving floral tributes at the station, while others gathered and hurled abuse at police. Officers warned those present that they were part of an unlawful assembly, before the more than 50 arrests.  Police said all of the arrested, 43 men and 11 women aged 12 to 70, were engaged in offences including illegal assembly, public disorder, possession of instrument fit for unlawful purpose, and theft, while no one was held or fined for violating the social-distancing rules. The force added that officers had stopped and searched 75 individuals in the area, and taken their personal details for further investigation.  “The police did not arrest any of them or issue them with a summons under any regulations,” a spokesperson for the force said, adding that it reserved the right to take further action.   Lawyers who helped some detainees inside Mong Kok Police Station, near the MTR facility in question, said officers requested that they remove metal strips from surgical masks that they wanted to hand to their clients. The masks, commonly worn by Hongkongers during the epidemic, are intended to stymie the spread of infection.  Janet Pang Ho-yan, a lawyer who provided assistance to about 10 arrestees on Tuesday night, said they had taken new surgical masks to detained protesters after their face coverings were replaced by “very thin, paper-like” masks provided by officers. She said that, as officers regarded metal strips embedded in the masks as “dangerous objects”, she and other lawyers tore open the coverings and took out the strips inside before handing the supplies to police. Coronavirus: six-week-old boy among 51 newly confirmed patients 2 Apr 2020 Coronavirus: six-week-old boy among 51 newly confirmed patients 2 Apr 2020 “[Detainees] could not fix the masks properly on their faces to block the virus without metal strips,” she said. “The police practice is actually putting both detainees and officers at high risk of infection.” According to Chapter 49 of the Police General Orders, duty officers should ensure that detained people do not have any object with which they could harm themselves or others, “or any implement with which an escape may be effected”. Separately, restaurants which support the anti-government movement have accused police of abusing social-distancing rules to suppress their business. Since Saturday evening, restaurants have had to limit the number of diners at each table to four, and separate each table by 1.5 metres (4.9 feet).   Lung Mun Cafe, a Hung Hom establishment which has branded itself a “yellow business” – a term denoting support for the protest movement – posted on Facebook on Monday that officers dispersed queues outside the restaurant to stop people getting takeaway. Civic Party lawmaker Jeremy Tam Man-ho said officers requested Cafe Seasons in Central, which is operated by a son of pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai Chi-ying, to close its doors on Monday, to check the ID of its customers. “Such acts by police are an intimidation of pro-democracy businesses under the pretext of epidemic prevention,” Tam said. But a senior police source said officers inspected restaurants if they received complaints about crowds, regardless of business owners’ political views.   “We received complaints against restaurants that support and oppose the government, but we act fairly in accordance with the law. Those who dislike police will certainly jump out and accuse us of abusing our power,” the source said. The source added that officers needed to check diners’ identities as many people have reportedly breached quarantine orders. “Those who breach the order will be listed as a wanted person, and could be walking around the streets or eating at restaurants ... Checking identification is an important means to picking up these people. If not, opponents would accuse us of failing to catch the offenders.” Europe faces Easter indoors as Spain’s virus cases surge past 100,000 2 Apr 2020 Europe faces Easter indoors as Spain’s virus cases surge past 100,000 2 Apr 2020 Asked if enforcement instructions had been given to frontline officers, Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Siu-chee stressed that the law was intended to enhance social distancing, rather than lead to prosecutions.    “It depends on different circumstances but I believe officers know how to handle and make a balance when it comes to law enforcement,” she said.

The attack on Tai Po Police Station happened shortly before 2.30am, and was the second of its kind this week. On Monday, three petrol bombs were thrown into Happy Valley Police Station. three petrol bombs were thrown into Happy Valley Police Station Officers used extinguishers to douse the flames before firefighters arrived at the station on On Po Lane. Before Wednesday, there had been 16 separate firebomb attacks involving 71 petrol bombs against police buildings, including staff quarters, through the first three months of this year, according to police. Seven men and one woman, aged 16 to 62, have been arrested for alleged ties to three of the attacks. Hong Kong police say they are dealing with “almost unprecedented” number of bomb attempts Hong Kong police say they are dealing with “almost unprecedented” number of bomb attempts Assistant Tai Po district commander Johnson Chong Shing-yat on Wednesday said police had noticed a surge in the number of youths, including students, involved in recent cases.  “They might think that because they are young, they will receive a lighter sentence or even not be criminally liable [if caught]. That is a wrong impression,” he said. He warned that making or possessing a petrol bomb is a serious act and that arson carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, adding he believed some youths arrested in the anti-government protests of the past 10 months had been incited by false information.  “Police never tolerate any criminal acts and we will follow up these cases seriously and bring lawbreakers to justice,” he said.  So far, more than 7,000 people have been arrested for various protest-related offences, including rioting, possessing explosives and firearms without a licence, and arson. According to police, two in five of those arrested have been students, more than 1,100 of which were still in secondary school. In the latest firebombing at Tai Po Police Station, a police source said: “Three of the petrol bombs were hurled into the car park of the station. The other two landed near the gate at the entrance of the car park.” Remand in jail for student caught with petrol bomb during unrest in November Remand in jail for student caught with petrol bomb during unrest in November Three black-clad suspects wearing masks and gloves were seen running from the scene. At the time, officers from Tai Po district’s task force were carrying out an anti-crime operation nearby. They intercepted two male suspects, both aged 18, near the station. A sergeant was injured when the pair put up a struggle, and police said the two teenagers were eventually subdued and arrested. The third suspect, a 16-year-old boy, ran for more than 500 metres before being stopped by police on Yuen Shin Road. All three are Form Four and Form Five students at the same secondary school in the district. The source said he believed it was part of ongoing flash-mob attacks to “burn doghouses” across the city. Anti-government protesters use the term “doghouse” to refer to officers’ homes or police stations. He said officers were investigating whether someone had put the teenagers up to the attack. As of Wednesday afternoon, the suspects were being held for questioning and none had been charged. According to police, no damage was done to vehicles parked at the station and no evacuation was needed.

A week earlier, there was a similar firebomb attack at the police married quarters compound in Sheung Shui. In that incident, three petrol bombs were thrown into the car park, leaving two cars blackened. Officers arrested a 62-year-old man outside the building in connection with the attack, the fourth at the site in six weeks. No one was injured. Security around police quarters has been enhanced since January, after a message reading “burn doghouse” was posted on Telegram, an app frequently used by anti-government protesters. On January 29 and 30, there were petrol bomb attacks on four police stations and a patrol car within 24 hours, in a wave of action apparently intended to force the government to completely close the city’s borders with mainland China, and supply more protective gear to residents in response to the coronavirus epidemic.

The defendant, Choi Tsz-kit, was arrested at around 5am on November 11, the day when radical protesters caused citywide traffic disruptions in a campaign that aimed to bring the city to a standstill. radical protesters Tuen Mun Court heard Choi was among three people in the vicinity of an MTR Light Rail station in Tuen Mun vandalised by anti-government protesters, but no evidence showed that the student from Youth College of the Vocational Training Council took part in defacing the railway facility. Police officers subdued the defendant after a chase, but were unable to catch the other two. They found a petrol bomb in Choi’s backpack, and seized a 35cm hammer which he dumped on the ground during the run. Choi pleaded guilty to possessing offensive weapons in a public place, an offence which is accompanied by a custodial sentence. His lawyers told Acting Principal Magistrate Cheung Kit-yee the backpack did not belong to him, and Choi had only intended to carry it for other protesters temporarily. They added it was an out-of-character incident and the defendant was sorry.

On November 6, hundreds of students met HKUST president Wei Shyy to discuss Chow Tsz-lok, a second-year computer science undergraduate who fell from a car park near an area of confrontation between anti-government protesters and police two days before. Chow was in critical condition in hospital at the time and died two days later. During the dialogue at the campus’ Jockey Club Atrium, Shyy was urged by angry students to condemn what they claimed was police brutality. Chaos erupted at the forum after a mainland student was said to have pushed a local to the ground without offering an apology. A melee ensued leaving at least four people injured. Thousands of Hongkongers pay homage to deceased student Chow Tsz-lok Thousands of Hongkongers pay homage to deceased student Chow Tsz-lok A police spokesman said a student had subsequently filed a complaint and officers arrested a final year student in Tuen Mun at about 6am on Monday morning.  The spokesman said the man had been detained and added further arrests were possible. A university spokesman said it would closely monitor the development of the situation and would provide suitable help to the student involved.  Chow’s death sparked both peaceful and violent protests involving clashes with police.  The exact circumstances of the fall remain unclear, but many protesters blame police, who were at the time conducting a clearance operation nearby against a group trying to disrupt an officer’s wedding. Some have also accused the police of delaying medical help for Chow, who waited 30 minutes for an ambulance to arrive. However, the force said no officers entered the car park during that time. 	SCMP

Covid-19 pandemic anti-government protests The forecasts were made as official figures published on Monday revealed the median wage increased 3.8 per cent year on year to HK$18,200 (US$2,350), in data not reflecting the grim economic picture in Hong Kong today, they said. The Census and Statistics Department released the wage data in its 2019 annual earnings and hours survey of about 10,000 business ventures. Despite city’s woes, workers can expect 3 per cent pay rise next year, survey finds 31 Oct 2019 Despite city’s woes, workers can expect 3 per cent pay rise next year, survey finds 31 Oct 2019 Dr Felix Yip Wai-kwong, associate director of the centre for human resources strategy and development at Baptist University, said: “The samples collected from last May and June do not reflect the influence of the protests that started in the latter half of last year. “With the double hit of the protests and the coronavirus outbreak, almost all walks of life in Hong Kong have been hit hard with employees being laid off or having to take unpaid leave.  “I think this year’s median monthly wage will see a negative increase and may drop to around HK$14,000.” The government survey found the median monthly wage of Hong Kong employees in May and June 2019 was HK$18,200, 3.8 per cent higher than the HK$17,500 from the same period in 2018.  Those aged 15 to 24 earned HK$13,700 per month, amounting to a 5.3 per cent year-on-year increase.  The survey also showed a 3.6 per cent increase in the median hourly wage in May and June, from HK$70.5 in 2018 to HK$73 last year. The pay analysis excludes government employees, student interns and those on work experience, and live-in domestic workers as exempted by the Minimum Wage Ordinance.   Yip said it would take a long time for Hong Kong’s economy to recover and urged the government to contain the virus and fast-track the release of the HK$10,000 handout for each permanent resident – due in July – to stimulate consumption once the epidemic is brought under control. Alexa Chow Yee-ping, managing director of AMAC Human Resources Consultants, said the annual survey results were out of date. “The government should offer half-yearly figures or even quarterly figures which are ideal to reflect the recent situations,” Chow said.

Many only have the cash flow for three to six months.” Coronavirus: Chinese companies cut salaries and staff in industries hit hardest by Covid-19 Coronavirus: Chinese companies cut salaries and staff in industries hit hardest by Covid-19 Chow accused the government of being too slow to bailout companies and criticised officials for excluding industries such as retail and catering from health crisis funding. health crisis funding. Hong Kong’s unemployment rate surged to 3.7 per cent in the period between December 2019 and February this year, the highest in more than nine years, according to the government.

The rally centred on the events of July 21 last year, when a group of white-clad men wielding metal rods and wooden poles attacked protesters and commuters indiscriminately at the district’s MTR station and on a train, injuring 45. Police were accused of arriving late to the scene, while the force said manpower had been tied down dealing with violent protests in the city centre. On Saturday, demonstrators started a fire on Tai Tong Road and blocked some lanes in the district, prompting officers to rush to the area soon before 9pm to disperse the crowd. Members of police’s Special Tactical Squad, known as Raptors, subdued at least two people.   Protesters initially planned to march on Castle Peak Road in Yuen Long and stage a silent evening sit-in at three rail stations: Causeway Bay, Chai Wan and Heng Fa Chuen.  More than 100 people showed up in Yuen Long shouting slogans such as “liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time!”, “Hong Kong independence is the only way out” and “five demands, not one less” at about 7pm. The scene had been largely calm early on despite the heavy presence of police officers in Yuen Long and Causeway Bay. Police intercepted some people dressed in black and performed body searches. On Saturday, the MTR Corporation kept Yuen Long station open on the 21st of a month for the first time since August, though it closed some exits at 4pm.  By January, a total of 37 people – some with links to triads – had been arrested over the Yuen Long attacks, seven of whom were charged with rioting.  Police have said they are continuing to collect evidence.

A joint statement from chairmen at 17 different councils said: “We ... condemn police for using excessive force and abusing arrest proceedings, hurting Hongkongers' freedom.” By the early hours of Sunday, clashes were still ongoing between protesters and riot police in Yuen Long, with pepper spray deployed by officers to disperse crowds as angry onlookers hurled verbal abuse.

On Saturday, Commissioner of Police Chris Tang Ping-keung said on a television programme that a number of cases were classified as “substantiated” after investigations by the Complaints Against Police Office, the force’s internal unit. “Some are substantiated, and some are unsubstantiated. Some are [classified as] ‘no fault’ and some are untraceable,” he said, adding that he could not go into the distribution of cases as they had been handed over to the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC). At the centre of the storm was police’s use of force in the handling of protests, but the government has repeatedly rejected calls to set up an independent committee to look into incidents and quell public anger. More than 5,100 Hongkongers have filed complaints involving some 1,600 cases to police since the social unrest, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, erupted last June.  Tang said many complainants referred to the same incidents, and most were people who were angered after watching online videos, instead of ones directly affected by police action. The police chief previously said 21 officers had been reprimanded after the force launched its own investigation into alleged misconduct. Among those was an officer who , another who shot a sponge grenade at a reporter, and two incidents in which journalists’ identity cards were held in front of a live camera.  held in front of a live camera  Lawmaker Ted Hui Chi-fung was among the complainants, and accused an officer of deliberately removing his eye shields before pepper spraying him in Causeway Bay on January 1.  “Tang said 21 officers were reprimanded. That’s impossible that only 21 were involved in misconduct over the past months. No one believes it,” Hui, of the Democratic Party, said on Saturday. He said he was asked to testify only recently and had yet to hear updates from police. Hui went on to question police transparency, and said he had no confidence in the IPCC, as it had no investigative powers to subpoena documents and summon witnesses. More than 7,000 Hongkongers have been arrested in connection with the unrest, with clashes between protesters and police often turning violent. Radical demonstrators hurled petrol bombs and bricks at officers, while the force has fired more than 16,000 rounds of tear gas and 10,000 rubber bullets.

Fanling Court heard that Go Nim-chung, 20, had intended to go to the border town of Sheung Shui on January 5 to take part in an authorised rally against mainland Chinese shoppers and parallel traders. But he was intercepted by police officers outside Fanling MTR Station, about 2km from Sheung Shui, and subsequently arrested for possessing the cutter. The border town of Sheung Shui played host to a rally against mainland Chinese parallel traders on January 5. Police ended up arresting about 50 after the march deviated from its authorised route. SCMP: Sam Tsang The border town of Sheung Shui played host to a rally against mainland Chinese parallel traders on January 5. Police ended up arresting about 50 after the march deviated from its authorised route. SCMP: Sam Tsang Senior court prosecutor Alan Yau Sik-lun told the court on Friday the prosecution had little chance of securing conviction because they could not prove the defendant had intended to wound others at the rally. The prosecution initially insisted Go had been considered suspicious as he was wearing a black jacket, the same colour typically worn by anti-government protesters, and picked up his walking speed after noticing he was being tailed by police.  Defence counsel Vivian Wong Ying-kei disputed that interpretation, saying her client might simply have been in a hurry. Police arrest nearly 50 accused of deviating from protest route 5 Jan 2020 Police arrest nearly 50 accused of deviating from protest route 5 Jan 2020 While not offering an explanation for why Go was carrying the box cutter, Wong said the device could just as easily have been intended for cutting paper and that its presence did not constitute proof he planned to hurt people. “It was the prosecution’s wishful thinking to believe they could secure a conviction with the seizure of a box cutter,” Wong said.  Acting principal magistrate Don So Man-lung granted legal costs of HK$27,000 (US$3,500) to the defendant after hearing counsel’ submissions.  The January march in Sheung Shui resulted in about 50 arrests. Three other arrestees were previously charged with either possessing weapons or disorderly behaviour in a public place.

The city’s Explosive Ordnance Disposal Bureau revealed the latest figures on Friday while showing just how much damage some of the explosives they have seized can cause. “We’ve been dealing over the last few months with an ongoing bombing campaign [that is] almost unprecedented in Hong Kong,” senior bomb disposal officer Alick McWhirter said. According to McWhirter, the force dealt with 187 explosives cases in 2019, up from 116 the year before. Hong Kong police say they are dealing with “almost unprecedented” number of bomb attempts Hong Kong police say they are dealing with “almost unprecedented” number of bomb attempts The bulk of those, 162, came between June and January during a period of often violent social unrest that evolved from protests over the now-scrapped extradition bill. The same eight-month period also saw 52 bomb hoax reports. More recent bomb plots, police said, came as residents protested the Hong Kong government’s response to containing the coronavirus outbreak.  In early March, authorities seized more than two tonnes of explosives and chemicals and arrested 17 people, accusing the group of plotting attacks against police officers. Suspects planned to attack police by rigging mock shrine with explosives 11 Mar 2020 Suspects planned to attack police by rigging mock shrine with explosives 11 Mar 2020 While today’s devices are increasingly more sophisticated, the city’s most devastating bombing campaign remains the 1967 riots, which saw police deal with more than 1,100 bombs and countless hoax devices amid violence that left 51 civilians and officers dead. In Friday’s demonstration, two separate doses of RDX, a popular bomb-making compound, ripped through furniture and tore a dummy into shreds, blowing out the windows of 150-square-foot rooms.  It did not involve material seized from suspects, but were fashioned to recreate the sense of impact, Chin Chiu Suryanto, an officer in the bureau, said.  “It’s similar to threats in other countries,” he added. Materials for making home-made explosives that have been seized in the past year include triacetone peroxide, a highly unstable substance often referred to as TATP, that can be got hold of in Hong Kong “with difficulty”, according to McWhirter. The white crystalline powder is the same material used in suicide bombing attacks in Manchester in 2017 and Brussels in 2016. The﻿Post reported earlier this week that Hong Kong police could potentially invoke international anti-terrorism legislation in a bid to have local bomb-makers designated as terrorists, which would make them eligible for potential life sentences. Post “Anytime we go somewhere, it’s a surprise to us,” McWhirter, who has been with the disposal team since 1996, said of the calls his unit is sent on. “Certainly [the attacks are] starting to bear all the hallmarks of home-grown terrorism.” 	SCMP

While acknowledging the “hard work and difficulties” faced by other departments, Ka-wing defended Headliner’s role on the network, pointing out it was “not a factual programme”. Headliner’s “Firstly, it is non-news. Secondly, it is satirical and ironic,” Leung wrote. “It belongs to the genre of satire which taps into hot societal topics through jocular expressions.” Central to the dispute are two Headliner episodes from last month that touched on hot button issues. Headliner  In a February 14 episode, one comedy sketch implied police had stockpiled masks for officers amid a citywide shortage during the coronavirus epidemic. A February 28 episode, meanwhile, featured a segment that suggested police had failed to properly investigate deaths ruled to be suicides, a recurring talking point among anti-government protesters during months of social unrest. months of social unrest  The two episodes led to the lodging of a formal complaint with the Communications Authority last week and a letter Tang publicly addressed to Leung. In his letter, Tang argued the show was failing to “reflect views from all sides” by siding with violent protesters – protesters who were conspicuously never the butt of the programme’s jokes.  Addressing the situation further in a Saturday radio interview, Tang said while he liked watching Headliner, and had no problem with being imitated, “they cannot deliver false and misleading information and cause the public to lose trust in us”. a Saturday radio interview Headliner Leung, who is expected to present his case to the RTHK Board of Advisers on Friday, argued in his letter that Headliner had a “definitive and unambiguous” character and approach “well recognised by the members of the public”. Headliner “While syncing with the social pulse, it serves as an effective outlet for grudges and resentment,” he wrote. He went on to say, however, that the broadcaster, which airs a diverse array of programming including news, information, education and sports 24 hours a day, shared broadly common goals with Hong Kong’s other government departments. “RTHK, as all our counterparts within the HKSAR Government, shares the common aspiration of serving the people of Hong Kong,” the letter said. “While we appreciate the hard work and difficulties of other government departments unequivocally, we also aspire for cross-departmental understanding and respect such that each performs its own functions, in hopes of better serving the public and the betterment of society.” Part of improving its programmes, he added, was listening to feedback. “We cherish every comment,” he wrote. “We can reassure the public again that RTHK does listen to complaints, accepts criticism, and never stops finding ways to improve.” Leung also noted that while Headliner received some 6,500 complaints between February 1 and March 8, there were more than 34,200 compliments sent in about the TV show. It was the second-most-watched show on RTHK’s official YouTube channel in February, recording more than 13.1 million views. Headliner Former lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen, who sits on the RTHK board of advisers, said he expected Leung to address board member’s concerns at Friday’s meeting. “There is an RTHK Charter for the station to follow, no matter if a programme is a news programme or not,” he said. That charter states RTHK must adhere to editorial principles of accuracy and impartiality. A police spokesman on Thursday said the force had no comment beyond Tang’s remarks of last Saturday. Current affairs observer Chan Wai-keung, meanwhile, a veteran lecturer at Polytechnic University, said the row between the two departments put Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor in a difficult position. “The anti-government side will think Lam is suppressing RTHK because of its critical stance against her governance. On the other hand, the pro-establishment side is not happy either because they think Lam has not been tough enough against RTHK,” he said. 	SCMP

The defendants, who were charged at Sha Tin Court, allegedly conspired to injure officers with explosives during a Sunday protest in Tseung Kwan O. Protesters had gathered in the area on Sunday night to pay tribute to the late Alex Chow Tsz-lok, who died after falling from a building during a protest last November. Senior public prosecutor William Siu Kai-yip told the court the plan was to plant a bomb inside a mock shrine, then remotely set it off when police officers approached it. But the defendants were arrested along with 11 others before the attack could be carried out, Siu told acting principal magistrate Daniel Tang Siu-hung. The six defendants – Ho Cheuk-wai, 36; decoration worker Lee Ka-pan, 25; security guard Ng Tsz-lok, 27; programmer Cheung Ka-chun, 29; clerk Yeung Yi-sze, 28; and government contract worker Cheung Cheuk-ki, 24 – were jointly charged with conspiring to cause an explosion with intent to endanger life or property.  Siu said the accused were involved in three other bomb attacks in the city, targeting Caritas Medical Centre on January 27, the Shenzhen Bay port on January 28, and an MTR train bound for the Lo Wu border checkpoint on February 2. An additional count of possession of anything with intent to destroy or damage property was laid against Lee, and jointly against Ng and Cheung Cheuk-ki.  The three were accused of intending to endanger life by damaging property with improvised explosive devices.  Court documents alleged that Lee had kept 2,589kg of explosive ingredients in a commercial flat in Tai Kok Tsui. They included 624kg of magnesium powder, 275kg of sodium, 1,640kg of ammonium nitrate, and 50kg of potassium iodide. In another flat of the same building, Ng and Cheung Cheuk-ki allegedly possessed 14.52kg of explosive ingredients, namely 10.5kg of magnesium powder, two kilograms each of sulphur and nitrate, and 20g of gunpowder. Police also seized three bottles of drain cleaner from Lee, and 56 electronic matches and three circuit boards from Ng and Cheung Cheuk-ki, according to the court filing. Tang adjourned the case to June 26 in Eastern Court to allow time for police to conduct further investigations. He remanded Lee, Ng, Yeung and Cheung Cheuk-ki in custody, after the prosecution objected to their releases. Ho and Cheung Ka-chun, who are currently hospitalised, will be brought to court upon their discharge. Prosecutors did not reveal the reason the two are in hospital. The maximum sentence for causing an explosion with intent to endanger life is life imprisonment. The remaining 11 suspects were earlier released on bail without charge. Meanwhile, Tai Po pro-democracy district councillors Herman Yiu Kwan-ho and Dalu Lin Kok-cheung were arrested by police on Wednesday afternoon for allegedly obstructing their investigation, fellow councillors said. The pair were released on HK$1,000 cash bail in the evening. Yiu and Lin two also been taken to Tai Po police station then released in the early hours of Sunday as officers searched Kwong Fok Estate. Police previously said some district councillors had refused to leave and demanded entry to the flat while the raid was being conducted.

Hong Kong’s flag carrier on Wednesday warned of damaging financial consequences from the coronavirus epidemic that had left the global aviation industry reeling. coronavirus epidemic The airline said it was unclear when the tough conditions would improve, as business continued to be “extremely challenging financially”. Hong Kong flagship airline Cathay Pacific hit with financial trouble amid coronavirus outbreak Hong Kong flagship airline Cathay Pacific hit with financial trouble amid coronavirus outbreak Patrick Healy, Cathay’s chairman, said: “Travel demand has dropped substantially and we have taken a series of short-term measures in response … despite these measures we expect to incur a substantial loss for the first half of 2020.” Healy, who described the challenges facing the aviation industry as “unprecedented,” said he was cautiously forecasting a recovery in the second half of the year, but added the situation could change quickly.  Cathay’s annual profits dropped 28 per cent to HK$1.7 billion last year on revenue of HK$107 billion, which came amid months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong and the axing of Rupert Hogg, its CEO. months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong Rupert Hogg During the Covid-19 crisis, the Cathay group is carrying 20,000 passengers daily in March, down 81 per cent, and had parked up to 150 planes a day, the airline said.  “Based on the capacity drop, the revenue drop in these few months has actually been more severe,” chief customer and commercial officer Ronald Lam Siu-por said of the expected loss in earnings.  The emergency savings put into effect include getting 80 per cent of staff to take three weeks of unpaid leave, and sharply cutting flights to match lower demand. Cathay Pacific ‘seeking new top financial officer’ 12 Mar 2020 Cathay Pacific ‘seeking new top financial officer’ 12 Mar 2020 Lam did not rule out job cuts, saying the “fluid situation” meant it was “too early to say” what could happen. Cathay's chairman Healy criticised the Hong Kong Airport Authority over its response to the crisis, pressing its bosses to offer more financial help to the beleaguered industry.  “We continue our discussions … and we hope they come to the table.”   Cathay said capacity would be reduced by 65 per cent in March and April, more than double the rate in February. That amounts to slashing three-quarters of flights this month and the next. Based on departures from Hong Kong, there will be 35 instead of 120 daily Cathay Pacific flights, 15 rather than 80 at Asia-focused Cathay Dragon and budget unit HK Express running five flights instead of 34. Hong Kong authorities pave way for airlines to cut flights this summer 10 Mar 2020 Hong Kong authorities pave way for airlines to cut flights this summer 10 Mar 2020 Further substantial reductions in May were also likely, the airline said. There was also the prospect of some cuts in June. Cathay said up to the end of February, its load factors, which measure how full flights are, had declined by around 50 per cent and year on year, the yield – how much money the airline makes on air tickets – “had also fallen significantly”. Notably, the airline, which currently operates 236 aircraft, maintained it would invest billions in 70 new aircraft up to 2024 rather than revising its longer-term spending.   The airline was also in talks with Airbus and Boeing to delay the timing of aircraft deliveries, so it could hold on to large sums of cash. Its financial performance in 2019 beat the expectations of six analysts surveyed by the Post, who estimated a second half loss, but a full year profit last year of HK$1.15 billion on revenue of HK$107.2 billion. Post In the second half of 2018, the airline made a profit of HK$2.6 billion. The airline last made a half year loss – HK$263 million – in the first half of 2018. Cathay Pacific CEO resigns in midst of Hong Kong protest controversy 16 Aug 2019 Cathay Pacific CEO resigns in midst of Hong Kong protest controversy 16 Aug 2019 Jefferies’ analyst Andrew Lee said the airline’s results were welcome but the management’s downbeat tone was a concern. He noted the airline’s “more bearish tone, given management expected the first half of 2020 would be significantly down on the same period last year, during the January 2020 traffic update announcement.” On Cathay’s prospects, Luya You, analyst at Bocom International, said: “Looking at isolated and rather staggered outbreak patterns globally, I would wager that initial hopes of a rapid V-shaped recovery is growing less and less likely.” Meanwhile, Cathay has refused to comment on the future of finance chief Martin Murray after sources told the Post the company was considering external candidates for the role.

The Electoral Affairs Commission also said it had asked the law enforcement agencies to follow up on two other cases, including one concerning miscounted ballot papers at a polling station in Kwai Tsing district, and another one in which an officer of a polling station in Tai Po district allegedly issued a voter a ballot paper without verifying his identity. The mistakes were disclosed in the commission’s report on the district council elections last November, submitted on Tuesday by its chairman, Mr Justice Barnabas Fung Wah, to the city’s leader, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor. The commission noted the number of complaints lodged over the polls had been the highest ever, at 50,019, compared with 10,520 complaints lodged during the previous district council elections in 2015. November’s elections were given the go-ahead amid a lingering social unrest triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. social unrest extradition bill There was a record number of 1,090 candidates running for the seats in 452 constituencies.  The number of voters was also a record high at more than 2.94 million, representing a 71.23 per cent turnout. More than 4,800 complaints filed for district council elections 23 Nov 2019 More than 4,800 complaints filed for district council elections 23 Nov 2019 The commission said there had been “unprecedented challenges”, adding the competition was the “fiercest ever” and that there were unlawful and irresponsible behaviours, such as assaults on candidates and intimidating messages being displayed on “Lennon Walls”, but it refrained from taking any names or giving examples. Of the complaints lodged, almost half were about vote-counting arrangements.  In one of the complaints, a ballot paper belonging to a constituency of the Eastern district wrongly reached a polling station in Kwun Tong district. An inquiry found the ballot paper was among the two considered substandard that should have been replaced. But they were wrongly replaced by two other ballot papers for a constituency in Kwun Tong.  “It was possible that when the staff was checking and replacing the relevant ballot papers for the [Kwun Tong] constituency, the papers for the [Eastern district] constituency were still on the same table. The staff concerned might probably have made the mistake under time pressure,” the probe concluded. The commission said it considered the incident “serious as it has inevitably affected public confidence in the handling of ballot papers by relevant departments”, although it was satisfied “the incident had no impact on the final election results”. In another case, a polling officer was criticised for issuing a ballot paper to an elector without verifying his name. The elector was concerned that someone else might have used his identity to reapply for ballot papers. “After preliminary investigation, the [Registration and Electoral Office] found that the case might involve illegal conduct and has referred it to the relevant [law enforcement agency] for follow up,” the commission report stated. The commission also referred the case concerning miscounted ballot papers at a polling station in Kwai Tsing district to the law enforcement agencies. Why Hong Kong district council elections are important 23 Nov 2019 Why Hong Kong district council elections are important 23 Nov 2019 At the polling station, a total of 8,089 ballot papers were counted, but records showed only 8,059 voters had turned up. The commission said the returning officer in charge of the polling station had made a series of mistakes, including mislabelling ballot papers, leading to the wrong count. But on the whole, the commission was satisfied that the polls were conducted in “an open, fair, honest and safe manner”. “Except for the problems of order during counting at certain stations, the process on the polling day was on the whole completed peacefully,” it said.

The stock exchange decided to delist Superb Summit International Group last year after US short-seller Muddy Waters published a report in 2014 that led to an indefinite suspension of its trading. stock exchange But Superb Summit has applied for judicial review to save its listing, accusing the city’s stock exchange of failing to take into account the “exceptional circumstances in Hong Kong during the second half of 2019” before deciding last November to remove the company from the main board. Muddy Waters alleges fraud at Superb Summit 21 Nov 2014 Muddy Waters alleges fraud at Superb Summit 21 Nov 2014 The exchange was also accused of failing in its duty to give adequate reasons for the move after relying on the report from Muddy Waters LLC, which the Chinese company believed had a conflict of interest because it intended to short-sell its shares. Superb Summit is now seeking an order from the High Court in Hong Kong to quash the decision to cancel its listing, as well as an interim order to put its delisting on hold until the judicial review application is determined, according to a notice filed last month and made available on Tuesday.  The exchange has yet to announce the cancellation of the company’s listing in light of the expected legal challenge. Superb Summit had initially halted its trading on November 20, 2014 after Muddy Waters accused the Chinese company of fabricating its revenue following years of failing business.  Some allegations later became the subject of an investigation by the Securities and Futures Commission, which, in a rare move, directed Superb Summit to suspend its trading from December 15, 2015.  The company had since submitted two proposals to the watchdog and the stock exchange in an attempt to resume trading. But the stock exchange listing committee last November decided to remove the company from the main board, and that was upheld by the listing review committee on January 23. “[The applicant] appeared to have made very little, if any, substantive progress in relation to the resumption conditions,” the letter read.  Spreading virus sets off biggest global stock market rout since 2008 28 Feb 2020 Spreading virus sets off biggest global stock market rout since 2008 28 Feb 2020 Lawyers for Superb Summit have called the decision unreasonable, unfairly obtained and unsafe. They said the committee had failed to take into account the company’s efforts in addressing the issues arising from the Muddy Waters’ report and that it had made considerable progress in complying with the conditions for resumption. They also said that Hong Kong’s situation had hampered progress in completing audits and meeting those conditions, and it was beyond the company’s control. Hong Kong has been gripped by anti-government protests sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill since June last year, which contributed to the city entering recession in October. anti-government protests Superb Summit has been listed on the stock exchange since September 2001.

The visit by the seven-member delegation, which included opposition figures, was the first since US President Donald Trump signed into law the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act amid violent anti-government protests that erupted last summer. The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act is a sledgehammer 12 Jan 2020 The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act is a sledgehammer 12 Jan 2020 Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, chairwoman of the pro-establishment New People’s Party, said US penalties on the city would be detrimental to Washington’s objectives. “They understand that if sanctions are imposed against officials, US interests will eventually be affected if there are countermeasures against them,” she said, calling on Washington to respect Beijing’s authority over Hong Kong. That 1992 act allowed for the city to be treated differently from mainland China in terms of trade, diplomacy and politics following the 1997 handover.  But last year, amid the escalating violence, widespread expressions of anger against Beijing and calls for American intervention in the city’s affairs, both the US House of Representatives and the Senate unanimously passed the rights bill, which Trump signed into law in November. It paves the way for Washington to take diplomatic action and economic sanctions against the city’s government, and requires the US government to regularly assess Hong Kong’s autonomy to preserve its special trading status under the 1992 law. Donald Trump signs rights act into law, brushing off China’s warnings 28 Nov 2019 Donald Trump signs rights act into law, brushing off China’s warnings 28 Nov 2019 Executive Council convenor Bernard Chan said he told the Americans that passing the rights act at such a time was “inappropriate and unhelpful”. Chan said he told the officials: “Even though you may claim all you do is with good intentions, the unintended consequences are to further divide the people in Hong Kong.”  American officials attending the talks included the State Department’s Jonathan Fritz, who is deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs.  The opposition lawmakers joining the pro-establishment figures were Jeremy Tam Man-ho, Kenneth Leung and Charles Mok. A prominent figure of the anti-government movement, Joshua Wong Chi-fung, said he was not optimistic the US would announce sanctions in the upcoming report, but said the document would “definitely criticise” the erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy. Hong Kong democracy bill ‘spells hope for students’ 21 Nov 2019 Hong Kong democracy bill ‘spells hope for students’ 21 Nov 2019 “The US government may pay far more attention on handling the [coronavirus] pandemic,” Wong said, adding the upcoming American presidential election and the downturn in the global economy could see the city’s affairs take a back seat in Washington. Wong said the fact cabinet members had gone to the US demonstrated the Hong Kong government was worried that powers under the bill will be invoked. The US should also launch formal investigations to “identify and consider sanctioning” Hong Kong officials responsible for alleged police brutality during the anti-government protests, the letter says. Meanwhile, the Committee on Canada-China Relations in the Canadian House of Commons passed a motion to ""express its grave concern"" over the arrest in Hong Kong of Jimmy Lai Chee-ying, a media tycoon known for strongly criticising Beijing, and other pro-democracy politicians last month. In a statement issued on Tuesday, a spokesman for Beijing’s foreign ministry’s office in the city expressed strong opposition to the motion, saying the parliamentarians are “openly condoning the criminal suspects, impeding Hong Kong courts' judicial proceedings, and grossly interfering with Hong Kong’s judicial independence”.

That second-half performance saw an average of about 40 per cent fewer inbound travellers between August and December. Outbound passenger numbers also fell, though less severely.  Cathay has tried to prop up that shortfall by increasing the number of transit customers passing through Hong Kong – a group that generates less profit. Before the protests made their impact, a three-year restructuring and HK$4 billion cost-cutting drive had been due to finish at the end of last year, with 2020 supposed to be a banner year that marked a return to robust levels of profitability. Last year, the airline was also boosted by the HK$4.93 billion purchase of budget airline HK Express to gain a footing into the booming low-cost segment of travel. 	SCMP

The News Executives’ Association and the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) demanded the police chief and the city’s leader investigate the incident and another involving the pepper-spraying of cameramen at a different protest, and ensure officers respect press freedom. Late on Monday, the force said it was sorry about what it insisted was an inadvertent incident, an apology reiterated the next morning by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor. During a dispersal operation on Sunday evening in the car park at Sheung Tak Estate, police arrested 63 people for unlawful assembly, possession of an imitation firearm and offensive weapon, among other offences. Hundreds of anti-government protesters had gathered from 7pm to remember Hong Kong University of Science and Technology student Chow Tsz-lok and police quickly launched a search, telling people to line up for identity and bag checks as the assembly was illegal. anti-government protesters had gathered The second-year computer science student died of a severe brain injury after falling from the car park’s third floor to the second in November.  Several people were subdued and taken away from the memorial for refusing to cooperate with police. There was a heavy police presence late into the night and tensions remained high. After midnight, riot police chased a group of protesters near the estate, during which the Cable TV reporter – who was wearing a helmet and media vest – was knocked over by an officer carrying a shield. Hong Kong police and protesters in stand-off during memorial for student who died in car park fall Hong Kong police and protesters in stand-off during memorial for student who died in car park fall The officer did not stop.    On Monday, police said the scene had been crowded and chaotic but did not directly address the incident. Cable TV said it did not accept the police explanation and expressed its regret over the general reply, saying it had avoided the facts. In an open letter to Lam, HKJA chairman Chris Yeung Kin-hing urged Lam to deliver on her promise to respect freedom of the press. “Take action now to revamp the police force … strictly punish officers who broke rules and the law in attacking reporters,” he wrote. Yeung also criticised police for firing pepper spray at TV cameramen as they were covering protests in Tai Po on Sunday. In a statement, the News Executives’ Association said the incidents were “extremely regrettable”. “The top level of the government and police are responsible for … taking action on the relevant police officers,” it said.   The force’s publicity chief Kwok Ka-chuen wrote to William Fung Tak-hung, news editor at Cable TV, on Monday evening, saying the officer’s flooring of the reporter was inadvertent. But he stopped short of saying any further action would be taken against any officers involved. “Police felt sorry and send our sympathy to her,” Kwok wrote in the letter. Lam, speaking before her weekly cabinet meeting on Tuesday, also said police were “apologetic” about the “unintentional” contact. “In a chaotic situation, police have to enforce the law, or disperse the crowd. There cannot be detailed planning in split-second situations,” Lam said. “I hope everyone can understand and tolerate the difficulty.” The chief executive reiterated that her administration respects freedom of the press and would facilitate the work of the media. Reporters could also make complaints through normal procedures, she added. 	SCMP

Speaking at the UN Human Rights Council on Monday, Deputy Commissioner of Police Oscar Kwok Yam-shu described chaotic scenes of petrol bomb attacks on officers, the detonation of explosives in public areas and widespread vandalism over months of social unrest sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. social unrest extradition bill The force had the “unenviable task” of trying to preserve the rights and freedoms of innocent citizens for months, he said. In doing so, officers had stood in the way of those who “extorted their demands from the government through mob violence”. Kwok said in Geneva: “This is the real reason they are relentless in accusing police of brutality, as part of a comprehensive effort to vilify the Hong Kong police, with the aim of removing it from the equation so that the extortion could be successful.”   He said violent criminals preached to their followers that their noble cause justified the means. But he added that it was not the police’s job to judge their cause. “We are police officers. Our one and only mission is to find out whether anyone has committed a crime. If someone breaks the law, it is our lawful duty to stop him and arrest him,” he said.  “Whether a cause is altruistic or in fact self-serving is completely irrelevant to us. The law demands that we arrest them. The basic premise of the rule of law is that. No one is above the law.” Kwok wrapped up his speech, saying: “This is the truth about Hong Kong.”   Police faced accusations of using excessive force during protests that turned increasingly violent as radical protesters clashed with officers.  The UN Human Rights Office last year accused police of defying international norms and standards in their use of weapons, creating “a considerable risk of death or serious injury”.  Police have fired more than 16,000 rounds of tear gas, 10,000 rubber bullets, 2,000 beanbag rounds, and 19 live bullets, two of which hit and wounded protesters. Hong Kong police seize petrol bombs, bricks as protesters commemorate student death 9 Mar 2020 Hong Kong police seize petrol bombs, bricks as protesters commemorate student death 9 Mar 2020 Radicals hurled petrol bombs and bricks at officers, blocked streets, firebombed metro stations and attacked people with opposite opinions. More than 550 police officers were injured, with one being shot in his calf with an arrow. Kwok was part of the Hong Kong government delegation attending the council’s 43rd regular session, which is examining human rights issues in various member states. The Hong Kong group, part of the Chinese delegation, was led by Undersecretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Andy Chan Shui-fu and included officials from the police, Department of Justice and Security Bureau. In Hong Kong, Icarus Wong Ho-yin, founder of the group Civil Rights Observer, said that Kwok had not addressed the issues, which stemmed from the force’s failure to establish an independent complaints system. He said the public felt it had no channel to air grievances. Various Hongkongers have had their say in Geneva in recent months, including Canto-pop singer and pro-democracy campaigner Denise Ho Wan-sze, who said people’s rights had been eroded in the city. Billionaire Pansy Ho Chiu-king, who spoke at a meeting as chairwoman of the Hong Kong Federation of Women, accused protesters of silencing her. She said that pupils had being “indoctrinated” to hate police. 	SCMP

That came as police arrested 17 people on Sunday and seized 2.6 tonnes (2.9 short tons) of explosives in raids related to three earlier bomb plots at public facilities, and warned of the growth of local terrorism. arrested 17 people On Monday, four men and two women were charged with conspiring to cause an explosion likely to endanger life or to cause serious injury to property. Two of the men and one of the women were also charged with possessing anything with intent to destroy or damage property. The other 11 were released on bail. Under the city’s United Nations (Anti-Terrorism Measures) Ordinance, Hong Kong’s leader could apply to the court for an order to specify that a suspect was a terrorist or terrorist associate. The maximum sentence for causing an explosion of a nature intended to endanger life under the legislation is life imprisonment, the same penalty as for explosives-related offences under the Crimes Ordinance, the law normally used in such cases.  The police source said invoking the anti-terrorism law to bring suspects to justice would have a more “symbolic meaning” despite the similar jail terms, as the force had foiled at least 10 bomb plots since the anti-government protests broke out in June last year. Hong Kong police seize petrol bombs, bricks as protesters commemorate student death 9 Mar 2020 Hong Kong police seize petrol bombs, bricks as protesters commemorate student death 9 Mar 2020 “It could truly reflect the illicit acts and the current situation faced in Hong Kong, although the suspects risk the same jail terms under the Crimes Ordinance,” the source said. The ordinance, which has never been used, was enacted in Hong Kong in 2002 in line with a UN resolution after the September 11 attacks in the United States and spells out terrorism-related offences.  In a press conference on Monday, Assistant Commissioner of Police Albert Yuen Yuk-kin was asked whether the force would consider using the legislation to deal with the recent arrests. Hong Kong police and protesters in stand-off during memorial for student who died in car park fall Hong Kong police and protesters in stand-off during memorial for student who died in car park fall Yuen said: “We will consider the evidence available in each individual case and maintain close communication with Department of Justice. We do not rule out any possibility.”  He declined to say whether there was an immediate need to raise the city’s threat level from “moderate” to “high”, meaning the possibility of an attack and specific intelligence suggesting that Hong Kong was likely to be a target. But he said the force would conduct large-scale drills with other government departments and map out policies to raise readiness for home-grown terrorism, and the force would continue to gather intelligence and assess the risks. Firebombings, terror threat make budget increase vital: Hong Kong police chief 2 Mar 2020 Firebombings, terror threat make budget increase vital: Hong Kong police chief 2 Mar 2020 Early on Sunday, officers raided 22 locations and found three bombs, each containing 1.5kg (3.3 pounds) of explosives, and three remote-controlled devices. Some 2.6 tonnes (2.9 short tons) of chemicals – including black powder, nitrate mixture, sulphur, magnesium powder, and sodium – were found in one flat, along with six bottles of drain cleaner and 60 electric matches. Police believed they were linked to three bomb plots in January and February, when an explosive device went off at Caritas Medical Centre in Cheung Sha Wan, a day before another one was found at Shenzhen Bay control point. At Lo Wu railway station, one of two devices found on a train also caught fire and spurted white smoke.   Senior Superintendent Steve Li Kwai-wah, deputy head of the organised crime and triad bureau, said more explosives, including pipe bombs, were seized as evidence after Sunday’s arrests. He said the bombs earlier placed at the public facilities were intended to not only hurt police officers but also civilians. Li raised concern over the escalating violence and public safety. “We understand people can have their own beliefs or agenda. But I believe no civilised place would accept people using home-made bombs to threaten the government or citizens to follow their views,” he said. Anger after female reporter knocked over as police clear protesters 10 Mar 2020 Anger after female reporter knocked over as police clear protesters 10 Mar 2020 Some people had claimed responsibility on a social media platform before and after the plots, saying they intended to pressure the government into closing the city’s border with mainland China in response to the deadly coronavirus. coronavirus In an official statement released last Monday to reveal the city’s crime situation in 2019, the force labelled certain violent acts driven by the protests as “home-grown terrorism” and slammed online materials that were in effect “weapons-making handbooks” or “guides” to kill police officers. The UN ordinance defines a “terrorist act” as an action that causes serious violence against a person, serious damage to property, endangers a person’s life, creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public, seriously interferes an electronic system, or seriously disrupts an essential service, facility or system. It also categorises terrorism as actions or threats intended to compel the government or an international organisation, or to intimidate the public, for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause. A “terrorist” is defined as a person who commits, or attempts to commit a terrorist act. The chief executive could make an application to the Court of First Instance for an order to specify a person as a terrorist or terrorist associate. 	SCMP

Police said Sunday’s assembly was “unauthorised” and fortified the area with a heavy presence of the force. Before the assembly at about 7pm, police seized petrol bombs, glass bottles, lighters, bricks, umbrellas and helmets from the car park.

Police officers used pepper spray to disperse protesters blocking traffic with makeshift barricades, and appeared to make at least three arrests. Scores of protesters, many masked and wearing black, had marched in defiance of police warnings that it was an illegal assembly, chanting anti-government slogans familiar from months of social unrest including “disband police”, “five demands, not one less”, and “liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times”. When the marchers walked onto On Cheung Road and began blocking traffic, riot police moved in and used pepper spray at about 4.15pm. Man Nim-chi, an opposition district councillor for Tai Po, said he was among those sprayed with the chemical agent despite not taking part in the protest.  “I was on a pavement with some reporters to observe the event to see if the police used excessive force against the participants,” he said. “But one officer rushed in my direction and pepper-sprayed me in the face. It is sheer abuse of power.” Journalists covering the event were also among those pepper-sprayed.  Man said he would raise the issue with the police at a full district council meeting on March 24.  While a number of protesters remained on the pavements of On Chee Road after the clash, shouting verbal abuse at officers standing opposite them, their numbers had begun to dwindle by 5.15pm.   Tension had been building in the area since early in the day. Police were called to the Tai Po Jockey Club Clinic shortly before 6.30am after a security guard found an outer wall of the outpatient clinic had been spray-painted with the words “Oppose Pneumonia Centre”. Police classified the case as criminal damage, though no arrests have yet been made. In a statement later in the day, the Hospital Authority condemned the “malicious behaviour” and said they planned to step up security. The original residents’ rally and march, planned for about 2.30pm near the clinic on Ting Kok Road, was never approved by police. But while plans for the rally were officially abandoned, about 50 people gathered anyway, leading to warnings from police at 3pm and the eventual confrontation about an hour later. Protesters arrested during demonstrations against handling of outbreak 17 Feb 2020 Protesters arrested during demonstrations against handling of outbreak 17 Feb 2020 Last month, some 200 protesters marched and blocked roads in the northern New Territories district, protesting plans to designate the clinic as one of 18 across the city that can deal with mild suspected Covid-19 cases and demanding a “full closure” of the border with mainland China. Wu Yiu-cheong, another opposition-linked councillor on hand to observe Sunday’s protest, said the crux of the problem was a government refusal to heed public resistance to its plans for the clinic. “The residents’ voice is clear. But the government does not listen and tries to suppress opposition views. There were calls online for a residents’ gathering outside the clinic in the afternoon, but it could not be conducted at all because police moved in very early to stop and search residents, scaring some away some residents,” he said. Officials have said the designated clinics – targeted with violence more than once now – can help reduce the burden on public hospitals if there is a large-scale outbreak of the virus in Hong Kong. Last Sunday, police reported an early morning petrol bomb attack on another designated clinic, the South Kwai Chung Jockey Club General Outpatient Clinic. Another designated clinic in Kowloon Bay was fired-bombed that same night after protesters staged a rally. 	SCMP

Some 2.6 tonnes of chemicals and three unfinished home-made bombs were seized. Officers from the organised crime and triad bureau raided 22 locations across the city – including in Tai Po, Yau Tong, Kwun Tong, and three flats in a commercial building on Bedford Road in Tai Kok Tsui – and found the three bombs, each containing 1.5kg of explosives, and three remote-controlled devices. Some 2.6 tonnes of chemicals – including black powder, nitrate mixture, sulphur, magnesium powder, and sodium – were found in one of the flats in the building, along with six bottles of drain cleaner and 60 electric matches.

At Lo Wu railway station, one of two devices found on a train also caught fire and spurted white smoke. caught fire and spurted white smoke  Li said the items, especially the unfinished devices, could have exploded if heated or brought near a flame. “All three cases involved explosives connected to remote-controlled devices and [suspects] would claim responsibility on a social media platform before or after the plots. “Such a huge cache of chemicals and other related items stored in a commercial building would have put its residents under a tremendous threat. These people endangered public safety, ” Li said.  He refused to divulge further information about the suspects, and said police had yet to conduct tests to confirm the strength of the seized materials.

Officers later took a man away from the flat, while at least three people were also escorted from the public housing estate. Councillors from two other districts also reported similar arrests in their communities. Kwun Tong district councillor Wang Wai-lun said on Facebook that a young woman was arrested and detained at Kwun Tong Police Station. Li criticised residents of Kwong Fuk Estate and the Tai Po district councillor for “obstructing police work” by creating disturbances, calling the fire service to the flat, and triggering a fire alarm that stalled elevators in the building. On Telegram, the 92sign group had earlier claimed responsibility for the two bomb plots at the Shenzhen Bay checkpoint and Caritas Medical Centre. They identified themselves as frontline protesters, aiming to force authorities into closing the borders with mainland China amid the coronavirus outbreak. The group earlier said it had fled Hong Kong, urging supporters to donate to their cause through a bitcoin account. protesters “It’s too risky to stay in Hong Kong in the short run, so we’ve left before we can take revenge,” it said in a post on March 1. “But on the practical side, we need funding to keep running. Meals, ammunition, transport, and safety precautions, all these require money.” As of March 8, it had received about HK$44,800 (US$5,800) from 29 donors. Since late January, a series of bomb-related cases have taken place in Hong Kong. Beside the incidents at Caritas Medical Centre on January 27 and the Shenzhen Bay Control Point a day later, two explosive devices were found at Lo Wu railway station, near the mainland border, on February 2. On February 5, a bomb scare forced the evacuation of Tai Po Market railway station and disrupted train services. Officers from the bomb squad were called out, but the item – a shoebox wrapped with duct tape – proved to be empty. 	SCMP

Wong, a chef for more than 40 years, lost his job last month after the Ho Yin Seafood Restaurant at Laguna Plaza in Lam Tin where he worked suspended operations because of the coronavirus epidemic. He says he has changed jobs about five times since last June, when the anti-government protests started, hurting his industry. The coronavirus crisis has just made the situation worse. For more than a month since being laid off from the restaurant, Wong has visited almost all the restaurants along Nathan Road in Kowloon looking for a job, but to no avail. “It is so difficult to find work these days,” he says. “No restaurant is hiring. They are only laying people off or closing down.” Wong has lived alone since his divorce about 20 years ago, with his son living with his ex-wife.  He used to earn about HK$12,000 a month, but with no income after losing his job, he has moved into a hostel-style rental unit in Yau Ma Tei, sharing a room with two strangers, paying HK$1,500 a month rent. Despite living frugally, and dipping into his savings to cover monthly expenses of some HK$5,000, Wong is worried about how long that can last.  “I have been a chef for decades, and I’m not young any more. This is the only job for me,” he says. “I hope the epidemic will be over soon and I can go back to work to support myself.”  The coronavirus has killed more than 3,500 people and infected more than 102,000 worldwide, mostly in mainland China. Hong Kong has recorded more than 100 cases, two of whom have died.   The contagion has worsened the city’s recession and left many jobless or having their working hours and incomes slashed. Tens of thousands of Hongkongers to lose out as threshold for elderly welfare payments rises 8 Jan 2019 Tens of thousands of Hongkongers to lose out as threshold for elderly welfare payments rises 8 Jan 2019 Official statistics show the unemployment rate increased to 3.4 per cent in the period from November 2019 to January 2020 – the highest in more than three years, with 122,300 unemployed. The unemployment rate in the consumption and tourism-related segment of retail, accommodation and food services sectors reached a three-year high of 5.2 per cent, while that of the construction industry increased to 5.7 per cent – the highest in nearly six years, according to statistics. Secretary for Labour and Welfare Law Chi-kwong said the labour market would be subject to even more pressure in the near term because of the impact of the coronavirus on a wide range of economic activities. Facing job losses and income cuts, many struggle to survive in the world’s most expensive city, where there is little support for the unemployed. Hong Kong unemployment rate expected to hit 2003 level 29 Jan 2020 Hong Kong unemployment rate expected to hit 2003 level 29 Jan 2020 Leung Wai-Kwong, 66, lost his job in a transport company travelling between Hong Kong and the mainland city of Shenzhen in early February, after the Hong Kong government started requiring all travellers from across the border to be placed in a mandatory 14-day quarantine. The containment measure, which took effect on February 8, has forced his company to suspend operations, leaving more than a dozen employees jobless. Over the past month, Leung has only managed to work a few one-off, part-time delivery and cleaning jobs, and earned about HK$2,000. He lives with more than a dozen strangers in a flat in Mong Kok, where eight people sleep on four bunk beds in the living room alone, paying a monthly rent of HK$2,000. Now waiting to receive the government’s Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA), Leung says he hopes to return to his previous line of work once the crisis is over. He took the job a year ago, after living on CSSA of about HK$5,000 a month for two years, recovering from a painful right leg. “It was not easy for me at my age to find a suitable job and live independently,” he says. “I had a plan for the future, but the epidemic has got in the way, and left me wondering where my life is headed.” Hong Kong does not have an unemployment insurance system. The unemployed can apply to the Social Welfare Department for CSSA, which gives out monthly cash handouts to anyone who in financial need. Statistics from the department show that the number of unemployed receiving CSSA has been increasing since last June, from 11,710 to 12,589 in January, up 7.5 per cent. Peace Wong Wo-ping, chief officer of social security and employment of the Hong Kong Council of Social Service (HKCSS), says because Hong Kong has long had low unemployment, there is no mature system in place to support those out of work. “Without such a system, when the unemployment rate keeps rising, grass-roots residents will face great challenges,” he says. Opinion: Official poverty line is far from perfect 17 Dec 2019 Opinion: Official poverty line is far from perfect 17 Dec 2019 Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po announced a HK$120 billion relief deal in his 2020/21 budget speech on February 26, including a cash handout of HK$10,000 for all permanent adult residents, and relief measures for the labour market, based on the idea of “support enterprises, safeguard jobs”. Earlier, the city’s lawmakers approved a HK$30 billion anti-epidemic fund on February 21, including one-off cash injections to retailers, food and drink service providers, transport companies, and others. But labour unions say employees, unlike their bosses, have not received much direct help. “Instead of employees, the majority of the support goes to employers in selected industries. It can neither support all enterprises nor safeguard all jobs,” says Carol Ng Man-yee, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions. Among the government’s anti-epidemic fund is a HK$990 million special allowance for some 200,000 households living on such schemes as the working family allowance and student financial assistance. But Ng says not all people who have suffered are from low-income working families. Hong Kong’s low-income families struggling to afford masks, study claims 4 Mar 2020 Hong Kong’s low-income families struggling to afford masks, study claims 4 Mar 2020 A 59-year-old pilot was laid off by Hong Kong Airlines in mid-February, after working for the city’s third-largest carrier for more than three years. Asking not to be identified as he waits to claim unpaid salary, of more than HK$100,000 a month, the pilot, who has been flying for nearly 40 years, says he was sacked abruptly with no real explanation. “I was aware of the financial situation the company was in, but how they handled it was terrible and insensitive,” he says. He says he has no idea how the company chose who to fire, but suspects in his case his age played a part. He says pilots can fly until 65, but as he is approaching 60 it will be difficult for him to find work in the industry. Given Hong Kong’s struggling aviation sector, he plans to look elsewhere. Pro-business lawmaker Felix Chung Kwok-pan says the government hopes to support businesses so they do not close down and leave more people jobless, and says support is limited. Labour Party lawmaker Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung says an unemployment fund will be better targeted to help the unemployed. He has proposed a HK$30 billion unemployment fund, and the unemployed can receive up to HK$16,000 a month – about the city’s median income level. HK$10 billion welfare package a seismic shift in government’s priority 17 Jan 2020 HK$10 billion welfare package a seismic shift in government’s priority 17 Jan 2020 Both Cheung and HKCSS’s Wong are also looking into a long-term unemployment insurance system in Hong Kong. Cheung says such social infrastructure is necessary to safeguard people’s quality of life during hard times. “Hong Kong has relied heavily on the market mechanism to operate on its own, but it is becoming increasingly outdated, as the city could undergo difficult times more frequently, including epidemics and social events,” he says. “For those who are unemployed, they can’t wait long and still have to pay rent today or tomorrow,” he says.

That move came a day after the commissioner of police accused his detractors of turning his sense of humour into a scandal, a reference to a video that was leaked last month where he was seen jokingly telling Jackie Chan that the kung fu legend had taught him how to do his job. leaked last month But a resident who called Saturday’s radio phone-in show took Tang to task for his stance towards Headliner, and suggested it was police behaviour during last year’s anti-government protests that had damaged public belief in the force. Headliner “Why do you think it is [OK to have a] sense of humour for your private conversation, but you cannot tolerate the humour of Headliner?” she asked. Headliner  “Is it because they have pointed out the wrongdoing of the police force? I believe residents score the police force zero for their performance over the past year.” The caller went on to accuse police of using excessive force during the months of civil unrest, and making arbitrary arrests, and asked why not a single officer had been arrested.  More than 7,000 people have been arrested in connection with the unrest since June, which was sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. extradition bill Police not the ones who should apologise for chaos, says Tang 17 Jan 2020 Police not the ones who should apologise for chaos, says Tang 17 Jan 2020 In response to the petrol bombs, bricks and other weapons used by protesters, police have fired more than 16,000 rounds of tear gas, and 10,000 rubber bullets, while two people have been shot with live rounds.   In response to the caller, Tang said he was a fan of the show, but argued that it created a misleading impression of the force, which it should not do. “I like having a sense of humour. I also like watching the Headliner. The show yesterday [Friday] was funny and I don’t mind if they imitate me,” Tang said. “But they cannot deliver false and misleading information and cause the public to lose trust in us.” Headliner Tang argued that residents, including the caller, may have the wrong impression that the force had not worked hard on investigating scores of suicide cases after watching the show. In a sketch last Friday, a “policeman” read out a list of suicide cases and declared there was “nothing suspicious” about any of them. “That greatly affects our work in crime prevention and is not in the public interest,” Tang said. During the phone-in, Tang said the force was investigating allegations of misconduct against officers, and revealed 21 had been reprimanded. Among those was an officer who drove his motorcycle into a group of protesters last November, as well as two involving incidents where journalists’ identity cards were held in front of a camera during live broadcasts. “Reprimands do not mean the cases are over. We will continue the investigation for the received complaints via the Complaints Against Police Office,” he said, adding that the force issued reprimands as an immediate way to suppress such misconduct and to show other officers the behaviour would not be tolerated. In the coming year, the police force plans to increase its manpower by more than 7 per cent, with an extra 2,500 posts created to cope with operational needs. Tang admitted recruitment could be a challenge, but pointed out that those who wished to join the auxiliary force had increased by 70 per cent, and said that showed many people were still passionate to join the force.

Frustrated by the school closures – introduced by the city to contain Covid-19’s spread and extended into late April – Smith-Mann wants her three children to see out their education in England, away from the disruption that has become routine in Hong Kong since the now-withdrawn extradition bill sparked often violent demonstrations last June. now-withdrawn extradition bill Her 16-year-old daughter is enrolled in a boarding school from September, and her two sons will attend university in England in the autumn – a decision made before the virus, but one she feels has now been validated.  “They’re so restricted in terms of being able to go out safely during the protests. Now with the coronavirus they can’t even be in school with their peers in their last year at school,” says the owner of a public relations and communications consultancy business. Now with the coronavirus they can’t even be in school with their peers in their last year at school,” says the owner of a public relations and communications consultancy business. “They have spent probably 80 per cent of their time at home.” Pointing to the protests as a key factor in her decision, she says: “Every month has been more of a watershed moment for us where we thought, this is affirming our decision to spend more time overseas.”  Her family are not alone in their quest for a new life, with other residents and expats sharing their plans to leave on private social media groups. Hongkongers wanting to emigrate warned about pitfalls of choosing wrong agency 15 Jan 2020 Hongkongers wanting to emigrate warned about pitfalls of choosing wrong agency 15 Jan 2020 Many of them report how the coronavirus, which causes the Covid-19 disease and has heavily disrupted daily life, has allowed them to make up their minds once and for all, capping off the doubts planted by the civil unrest.  “I know a lot of people who are planning to leave next year,” says Jane, who asked not to reveal her real name because she owns a business with 11 staff in Hong Kong. Her family is among those that have decided to move back to Britain after 15 years in the city. She believes an exodus is coming over the next 18 months as families make plans on where to send their children for the start of the school year in September 2021.   As well as the impact on education, the coronavirus and protests have taken a heavy toll on many businesses. Hong Kong’s economy entered its first recession for a decade in October last year, and Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po warned earlier this month of the possibility of further contraction in 2020, as the epidemic hits retailers, restaurants, hotels and other companies hard. Jane’s distribution business is one of them. “It started with the protests. I’m in retail all over Hong Kong, so it affected me massively,” says the 47-year-old mother of two. “We got back on our feet and then again the coronavirus has really hit us.” Stay or go? Expats weigh their future in crisis-hit Hong Kong 28 Dec 2019 Stay or go? Expats weigh their future in crisis-hit Hong Kong 28 Dec 2019 Anger over the now-withdrawn extradition bill last year developed into a wider anti-government movement focused on democratic reforms and police accountability, leading Jane to believe the underlying issues have not gone away despite relative calm in the first few months of this year. “I don’t think we are finished with the unrest yet. I feel really sad. It’s very depressing at the moment. The whole appetite and trust in the police … I think it will take a long time to get that back, personally,” she adds. She is concerned at the prospect of laying off some of her staff, pointing to the squeezed job market. Her concern is echoed by the city’s recruitment firms, which say the economic downturn has soured expatriates’ desire to work in Hong Kong. Data obtained by the Post from the jobs website, JobsDB Hong Kong, revealed that from January to February there was a 52 per cent drop in jobs advertised in tourism and travel agencies, with those in hospitality and retail reporting 48 per cent and 40 per cent declines respectively. Post “2020 will be a tough year for the job market in Hong Kong,” says Isaac Shao, CEO of JobsDB Hong Kong. “In the face of the recent Covid-19 outbreak in the city, unemployment is set to rise this year to a comparable level, or even worse than that during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars).” Tear gas and arrests as Hong Kong rally for universal suffrage descends into chaos Tear gas and arrests as Hong Kong rally for universal suffrage descends into chaos Recruitment consultants warn that Hong Kong is becoming a less attractive option for foreign workers. “Over the past two months, 45 per cent of our recruitment agency customers have found it difficult to attract expats to Hong Kong roles due to the protests, amid concerns about safety or an employer’s commitment to maintaining a presence there,” says Shan Han, CEO of professional services company Zetl. “Singapore is usually cited as a preferred option.” Since the outbreak, recruitment consultants reported a drop-off in candidate inquiries for jobs, partly because of hiring managers wanting to meet a job applicant in person before making a decision, but also because of the time it takes for visa approval. Macau’s last Covid-19 patient recovers, with no new cases for a month 7 Mar 2020 Macau’s last Covid-19 patient recovers, with no new cases for a month 7 Mar 2020 Most of Hong Kong’s 180,000 civil servants returned to their offices this week after a month of working from home, with many in the private sector following suit. “Typically, it used to take three to six weeks to process somebody’s visa,” says Mark Francis, director of two recruitment consultancies, Silverstrand and Cleverly Search, who added a lot of documentation is still done on paper rather than electronically. “What we are encountering now is it’s taking anywhere from nine to 12 weeks, which is an incredibly long time … for someone to be sitting on the sidelines just waiting on their visa. There is a huge backlog, which will take time to clear.”   The protests and the epidemic have become the catalysts for local residents, already mulling a move, to accelerate their departure, says Piya Narang, managing director of Swift Relo, an international moving company. February is normally the quietest month because of Lunar New Year, but Narang reported sales have more than doubled compared with the same period last year. “This year it’s been a big twist for us. We’re fully booked every single day for removals. It’s basically like a summer period for us now,” Narang says, adding that the United Kingdom, United States, Australia and Malaysia are the top destinations for migrants. More than 40 per cent of Hongkongers want to emigrate, survey finds 11 Oct 2019 More than 40 per cent of Hongkongers want to emigrate, survey finds 11 Oct 2019 An influential American business group warns the protests together with the coronavirus and school closures have bruised Hong Kong’s once solid-gold reputation. “One major complaint in the business community is a lack of a visionary communication and government leadership as to how Hong Kong can recover and reshape itself. It’s simply dropping the ball,” says Tara Joseph, president of American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (AmCham), which has about 1,400 members. However, Joseph says the city still has many benefits for businesses, such as its solid infrastructure, connectivity with Asia and the rest of the world, along with the rule of law, and freedoms of speech and assembly, which “may feel under threat but … are still largely intact”. The bloom is off the rose. It’s just not the same. Christine Smith-Mann This sentiment is echoed by Sue Thomas, who left her job as vice-principal of a secondary school in Discovery Bay to start a consultancy business in September last year, during the height of the protests. “I arrived in Hong Kong just after Sars,” says the 55-year old. “I think Hong Kong is a very resilient community. It’s shown that it can bounce back. It’s going to take a while to recover, but I think it will.” Experts warn they expect the protests to pick up again in the summer, which will further scare foreign workers from wanting to move to Hong Kong. “We think there is a perfect storm on the back of last year’s protests, the fact we are in a recession, then this coronavirus,” Francis says. “It’s kind of like a triple whammy and it seems to be affecting a lot of candidate sentiment.” For Christine Smith-Mann, she believes the events of the past nine months have irrevocably changed the city where she was born. “The bloom is off the rose,” she says. “It’s just not the same.” 	SCMP

MTR Corporation It was the sharpest decline in percentage terms since the government-controlled company went public in 2000. CEO Jacob Kam Chak-pui said on Thursday: “2019 has been the most challenging year in the corporation’s 40-year history.” The embattled firm warned of more bad news in 2020, with the damaging legacy of the anti-government protests and the unfolding coronavirus outbreak expected to shave HK$1.3 billion off its recurrent business profit in the first two months of this year. anti-government protests coronavirus outbreak Including non-recurring items and property gains, the corporation’s net profit shrank 25.5 per cent to HK$11.93 billion last year. Profits from property development in Hong Kong more than doubled to HK$5.7 billion last year from HK$2.5 billion in 2018.   The MTR Corp said recurrent business profit would have risen 7.7 per cent to HK$9.71 billion if provisions of HK$2 billion related to the overbudget Sha Tin to Central link project and HK$436 million over a rail franchise in Britain were taken out.  The rail operator said it would allocate HK$86.5 million for fare rebates after it recorded 10 service delays of at least 31 minutes in 2019. The firm emerged as a target of radical protesters in August – two months after anti-government demonstrations broke out – after they accused the MTR Corp of bowing to pressure from Beijing following a scathing attack by mainland Chinese media.  Radicals trashed railway stations and set facilities on fire, hurled petrol bombs at entrances, spray-painted graffiti on walls, and threw objects onto tracks.  Kam said the financial impact of the protest amounted to about HK$2.3 billion in losses, including from reduced passenger traffic and rent cuts. More than HK$600 million was spent on repairing and changing facilities at damaged train stations. Total patronage fell 6.4 per cent last year, with a 14.8 per cent drop in the second half eroding the 2.5 per cent growth in the first six months. Train derailing inquiry finds MTR maintenance staff bungled track repairs 4 Mar 2020 Train derailing inquiry finds MTR maintenance staff bungled track repairs 4 Mar 2020  Fresh challenges arose in January when the coronavirus outbreak spread from mainland China to Hong Kong. Tourist arrivals have slumped in Hong Kong, schools and most cross-border checkpoints are closed, while many employees work from home and daily lives are at a standstill.   “The impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on our businesses is likely to continue for some time, but the precise timing and scale of the impact is difficult to predict and will depend on the development of the situation,” the MTR Corp said in a statement. “We have taken a number of cost control measures to mitigate the financial impact of this challenging situation.” It added that domestic trains recorded lower patronage, while cross-border ones were suspended, which in turn lowered revenue. While offering rent relief to tenants in its shopping malls, the MTR Corp recorded lower advertising income and negative financial impact on its mainland business.   The firm’s property director David Tang Chi-fai noted that customer traffic and sales in shopping malls were hit hard from late January, but said it would be too early to tell if the rent relief would be extended to April. Looking forward, the company said it expected to invite tenders for three property development projects in the next 12 months, involving more than 4,000 residential flats in total, but this depended on the market situation. A new mall Lohas Park Shopping Centre is expected to open in the second half of the year. Lawmaker Michael Tien Puk-sun, also former chairman of the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, said the MTR Corp’s overall performance fared better than many other companies reeling from the protests. “The business model of having two key components – rail services and property development, as well as investments and management – hedges risks and serves well in turbulent times,” he said. Meanwhile, Kam said the management team and him were duty-bound to investigate the city’s most serious derailment in more than two decades in Hung Hom last September. A report, unveiled on Tuesday, said the firm’s maintenance team lacked knowledge and relied on their experience more than scientific data. They also failed to follow protocol. Adi Lau Tin-shing, managing director for operations and mainland business, said the MTR Corp would launch a process into determining if relevant managers and workers would be disciplined. The government revealed the MTR Corp earmarked HK$300 million to upgrade a police clubhouse in Prince Edward to make up for recreational facilities in Causeway Bay torn down to enable construction of the Sha Tin to Central rail line. In a separate document, the government said the corporation had paid HK$15.4 billion out of HK$29.1 billion in claims to contractors that built the 26km local section of the high-speed rail to the mainland. The expenditure was within the project’s HK$84.4 billion cost. MTR Corp shares rose 40 HK cents, or 0.93 per cent, to HK$43.45 on Thursday before the results announcement. 	SCMP

Law Man-chung “The applicant believes a custodial sentence is appropriate,” Lam said on Wednesday. The prosecutor also urged the Court of Appeal to clarify the sentencing considerations for the lower courts to follow, and specifically asked whether jail terms were reserved for repeat offenders or those who had burned flags, which Law did not. Defence counsel Erik Shum Sze-man countered that 200 hours of community service was reasonable for a first-time offender who had shown remorse, and observed that general sentencing guidelines might be of limited use as the crime might take various forms. 200 hours of community service The Chief Judge of the High Court, Mr Justice Jeremy Poon Shiu-chor, leading Madam Justice Carlye Chu Fun-ling and Mr Justice Derek Pang Wai-cheong, have reserved the judgment.  Law was the first protester to admit to desecrating the Chinese flag during citywide protests that began in June last year in opposition to the now-withdrawn extradition bill, saying he did it “out of fun”. extradition bill News footage played in court showed that on September 22 last year, he threw the Chinese flag into the air, trampled on it and then threw it into a rubbish bin that was later pushed into a pool at Sha Tin Park.   Law, an air-conditioning apprentice, pleaded guilty at Sha Tin Court last October to one count of desecrating the national flag, an offence punishable by up to three years in jail and a HK$50,000 (US$6,428) fine.  Pre-sentencing reports said it was Law’s first offence, and depicted him as a responsible worker supported by his family and employer. The probation officer subsequently recommended Law do 80 to 160 hours of unpaid community service to give back to society and strengthen his civic awareness.  In sentencing, Magistrate Li Chi-ho said the offence was serious, but it was fortunate Law’s case did not involve more dangerous antics such as burning the flag, so he adopted the officer’s recommendation and increased the term to 200 hours to reflect the seriousness of the offence. Police arrest 115 after biggest outbreak of protest violence since coronavirus crisis 2 Mar 2020 Police arrest 115 after biggest outbreak of protest violence since coronavirus crisis 2 Mar 2020 A day after the case was heard, former chief executive Leung Chun-ying urged the Department of Justice to seek a heftier punishment, warning the sentence would spark anger across China, especially when it came after a mainland Chinese man was jailed for four weeks for spraying paint on the outer walls of the US consulate. Peop le’s Daily responded the following day in a commentary calling for serious punishment for anyone who abused the national flag, as it found the act was tantamount to issuing an open statement of separatism. Peop le’s Daily As Hong Kong protests raged, police solved lowest percentage of cases in 19 years 28 Feb 2020 As Hong Kong protests raged, police solved lowest percentage of cases in 19 years 28 Feb 2020 Hong Kong prosecutors applied for a review of the sentence on November 14, arguing that the defendant had committed a moderate-to-highly-serious offence but that the magistrate had underestimated the case, overlooked the degree of desecration, and neglected the need for deterrence. They also complained that Li had failed to fully consider the aggravating features of the case, such as Law’s active participation in a public place where many people were watching him. But Shum said he had studied the prosecution’s exhaustive list of past cases and found jail terms were only warranted under three circumstances – where there was a burning of flag, a repeat offence, or when other offences were involved. Even if a jail sentence was necessary in the present case, the counsel said it should be suspended. Law served 64 hours of community service as of January 12. Since then, all such court orders have been suspended because of public health concerns in light of the deadly coronavirus outbreak. coronavirus outbreak In December last year, a 13-year-old Hong Kong girl who admitted burning the Chinese flag “out of impulse” during a protest in Tuen Mun on September 21 was sentenced to 12 months’ probation. burning the Chinese flag 	SCMP

Analysts said the latest rankings reflected the overall decline in the competitiveness of research conducted by Hong Kong universities, as the data was collected before the anti-government protests, which badly affected the city’s higher education sector in the second half of last year. anti-government protests, Despite a drop in rankings in many subjects, HKU remained the world’s fourth-best institution to study dentistry, while the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts was rated as the seventh-best higher education institution for performing arts, up six places from 13th last year. The rankings compared 13,138 programmes in 48 disciplines provided by 1,368 tertiary institutions across 83 locations around the world. The results are based on four metrics: academic and employer reputation, research citations, and impact. Out of 39 subjects analysed at HKU, 21 subjects suffered a drop in rankings while seven saw a rise. The subject, education, dropped one place to being the world’s seventh best, while medicine fell five places to the 35th spot.  Politics and international studies suffered one of this year’s sharpest declines by slipping to 31st from 16th last year.

Its law programmes slipped four places from 39th to 43rd, while social policy and administration dropped five places from 29th to 34th.

He said the latest drop in the competitiveness of Hong Kong universities was more because of their research performance, while institutions in mainland China had been rising. Persistent disruptions in the city could also discourage international students, teachers, or researchers from choosing to attend or work at universities in Hong Kong, he said, leading to a drop in the institute’s research influence and reputation.   He said large-scale protests, such as the “umbrella movement” of 2014, might have already impacted local universities. “There has been sustained unrest at some levels going back much further than last June, including the whole umbrella movement that surfaced a couple of years ago, things have just escalated last year. It is reasonably likely to have an effect on these results.” “My feeling is that we are just beginning to see the impact of the sustained unrest at various levels,” he said. HKU did not comment on the decline in the rankings but only said it would continue to provide quality education and achieve excellence and innovation.

Exco convenor Bernard Chan and lawmakers Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, Horace Cheung Kwok-kwan and Martin Liao Cheung-kong will make the trip alongside opposition lawmakers Jeremy Tam Man-ho, Kenneth Leung and Charles Mok. The group will present their competing visions of Hong Kong to senior members of the US’ executive and legislative branches at a Thursday to Sunday World Affairs Council forum in San Francisco, according to the US Consulate General’s spokesman. The State Department is providing financial support for the trip. The objective is to “deepen the mutual understanding and exchange that has long been a hallmark of US-Hong Kong ties”, the spokesman said on Tuesday, adding a list of participants from the US side was pending.

He said the group was tentatively scheduled to meet Jonathan Fritz, deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs responsible for China, Mongolia, and Taiwan coordination, during the tour, along with officials from the US Department of Commerce and staff from the House of Representatives. Asked if he was worried the US government would impose sanctions on Hong Kong in the near future, Cheung said: “We can’t worry too much as it’s something beyond our control.” New People’s Party chairwoman Regina Ip said she planned to offer her own views on the protests and the city’s human rights status, a counterpoint to foreign media reports she believes have misrepresented the situation in Hong Kong. She said this week’s dialogue was part of the preparation work for a report on the implementation of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act due to be handed over to Congress by the end of March. Ip also took part in last year’s US-Hong Kong Legislative Exchange, which was convened by the Mansfield Foundation in August in Montana. She and lawmaker Felix Chung Kwok-pan represented the pro-establishment camp while four pan-democrats also attended the event. Separately, the top Chinese envoy in Hong Kong on Tuesdayexpressed “strong disapproval” and “firm opposition” to comments made by two US Senate Foreign Relations Committee members over the recent arrest of Jimmy Lai Chee-ying and two former pro-democracy lawmakers. In a statement posted on its official website, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry commissioner’s office in Hong Kong accused the “relevant senators” of glorifying “Jimmy Lai and his ilk”, adding that the senators’ calls for implementing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to levy sanctions equated to “blatant interference in Hong Kong affairs and China’s domestic affairs”. While the commissioner’s office statement did not name the senators, but it followed a Monday statement by US Senators Jim Risch and Bob Menendez expressing concern over the arrests of Lai, Lee Cheuk-yan, and Yeung Sum.

Defence counsel told Principal Magistrate Peter Law Tak-chuen that De Bruin entered Hong Kong as a visitor but intended to apply for a work visa so he could teach at a local kindergarten. De Bruin, whose visit visa expires in May, was charged with one count of arson along with 42-year-old Tang Chun-keung, a merchandising manager at a sports equipment company.

Commissioner of Police Chris Tang Ping-keung also said the force had reprimanded 21 officers after launching its own misconduct investigations into the anti-government protests that erupted in June last year, as he pledged greater transparency in city policing. anti-government protests Tang defended the bumper increase unveiled in the Hong Kong budget for manpower and weapons, while also responding to unguarded comments he made at a private dinner with stars from the entertainment industry, and admitting to flaws in his approach to the coronavirus. The commissioner accused his detractors of turning his sense of humour into a scandal after he came under fire last month over a leaked video showing him, as a working police officer, telling Jackie Chan that the kung fu film legend had taught him how to do the job. The presence of police officers gathering at the event without surgical masks during the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus also drew criticism. On Monday, Tang admitted: “I was not sensitive enough when it comes to social distancing.”  Tang spoke out on Monday after visiting newly built public housing on the Chun Yeung Estate in Fo Tan, which has been turned into a quarantine centre as part of the government’s emergency response to the epidemic. He took the opportunity to rebut accusations the force was overfunded, as his scheduled appearance before the Legislative Council’s security panel on Tuesday was adjourned because of the coronavirus.  Opposition lawmakers earlier said there was no urgency for the funding, and the government had failed to respond to calls to reform the force. Police to get 2,500 new posts in ‘biggest manpower boost since 1997’ 27 Feb 2020 Police to get 2,500 new posts in ‘biggest manpower boost since 1997’ 27 Feb 2020 Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po revealed police overtime pay and allowances for the previous financial year had soared to HK$2.5 billion (US$321 million), 10 times the original estimate, when he unveiled his 2020/21 budget last Wednesday.   On Monday, Tang said the months of anti-government protests, which were sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, led criminals to increasingly radical behaviour, even though there had been relative calm in the past few weeks. extradition bill He said the discovery of four remote explosive devices and five firearms over the last two months was particularly concerning as he likened the criminality to “potential local terrorism”. The police boss said the force had boosted manpower by 1,000 following the Occupy protests in 2014, and the Mong Kok riot in 2016. Protesters marking Yuen Long mob attack celebrate officer getting coronavirus 21 Feb 2020 Protesters marking Yuen Long mob attack celebrate officer getting coronavirus 21 Feb 2020 “But as you can see today, even with that additional 1,000 police officers, is it enough?” he asked. “I think we have to face the reality that there is a new normal.” “The new normal is that things cannot go back to one year ago. As you can see petrol bombs are being thrown every day at police stations, stores and clinics.” Night clashes around Hong Kong Polytechnic University Night clashes around Hong Kong Polytechnic University Tang, who took the helm in November, said some of his officers in extreme cases worked up to 60 hours in one continuous shift during the protests, so it was reasonable for them to be compensated. They would each receive little more than HK$10,000 a month for their overtime. so it was reasonable for them to be compensated. He said the extra funding for more officers was to save money on overtime pay, while new crowd control equipment was required to give them more options in deploying minimal force. The city’s top officer pledged to increase openness and said the force had taken the initiative to investigate allegations of misconduct, leading to reprimands for 21 officers.   Among those rebuked was an officer filmed ramming the motorcycle he was riding into a group of protesters in November, as well as two cases where journalists’ identity cards were held in front of a live-streaming camera. A third of the 1,639 officer misconduct complaints made to police were designated for investigation. Of those, 125 had been handed over to the Independent Police Complaints Council, the force watchdog. Two men accused of rioting in Hong Kong have charges withdrawn 21 Feb 2020 Two men accused of rioting in Hong Kong have charges withdrawn 21 Feb 2020 Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting said Tang’s explanation could hardly justify the extra funding as he criticised the quality of policing. He said some recent court cases had shown officers made wrongful arrests because prosecutors had to withdraw charges, and even had to shoulder legal fees. “When you asked me about the ‘new normal’, I thought you meant police brutality and abuse of power,” Lam said.   The lawmaker said a reprimand was too light a punishment for the police officer who rode a motorcycle into a crowd of protesters, adding Tang had still failed to address what Lam described as widespread instances from police of excessive use of force. He said in the past officers would have been criminally prosecuted if they had assaulted protesters. But legislator Vincent Cheng Wing-shun, of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, said the funding injection was needed because the protests exposed the lack of police manpower to deal with other crimes during large-scale unrest. He said it was a good sign police were reviewing officers’ actions and urged them to be transparent to regain public trust. Police arrest 115 after biggest outbreak of protest violence since coronavirus crisis 2 Mar 2020 Police arrest 115 after biggest outbreak of protest violence since coronavirus crisis 2 Mar 2020 Giving his latest update, the police commissioner said 7,549 people had been arrested since June for protest-related offences including rioting, possessing explosives or firearms without a licence, arson, criminal damage and unlawful assembly. Among them, 3,091 were students ranging from secondary school level to tertiary institutions, which accounted for up to 60 per cent of those arrests. He said there was a worrying trend that the ages of those held was getting younger as the unrest continued. 	SCMP

Hong Kong civic groups banned from using district council funds to purchase yellow and black masks for mass distribution	Civic groups in Hong Kong have been banned from using district council funds to purchase yellow and black masks for mass distribution, despite a citywide shortage of the protective gear amid the coronavirus outbreak. Pro-democracy councillors told the Post the colour restriction was associated with the anti-government protests that had gripped the city since June last year, but the Home Affairs Department said masks should be light-coloured so the users could easily spot stains on their surface. Post The coronavirus, which causes the disease known as Covid-19, has so far infected more than 90 people in the city, killing two. The crisis has prompted some district councils, dominated by pro-democracy councillors, to allocate funds to apolitical civic groups to enhance residents’ protection against the disease. Since the coronavirus outbreak erupted in Hong Kong in January, residents have been seen scrambling for supplies of protective gear, such as masks and sanitisers. Even though the supplies increased in February, the products are being sold at such a high price that they have mostly been beyond the reach of the low-income families or the elderly. The Sham Shui Po District Council’s Working Group on Healthy and Safe Community on February 17 allocated HK$1.3 million (US$167,000) to eight organisations to procure and distribute the protective gear or to organise events to raise awareness of the deadly disease.   But a civic group said it was served a notice by the council’s secretariat on Tuesday, after winning a HK$540,000 tender.  The notice, obtained by the Post, listed new restrictions by limiting all procured face coverings or ear-loop surgical masks to five colours – green, blue, white, pink, and purple. It also mentioned the face coverings will have to be of a “standard size”, meeting the “technical requirements of supplies to the Government Logistics Department”. Post Civil servants may regard yellow and black as sensitive colours as they were associated with the anti-government protests. But the restrictions should not apply to supplies distributed among the public Ramon Yuen, Sham Shui Po district councillor The group’s founder, who only revealed his surname Chan, said before they received the notice, they had already ordered around 100,000 masks from three suppliers, including 30,000 pale yellow ones from the United States, which cost HK$3.5 each, as well as 70,000 blue and green masks from Tunisia and Canada, respectively. “[The secretariat] reminded me over the phone that if I do not strictly comply with the government standard, we will not be reimbursed,” Chan said. The colour restriction came on Tuesday, while the group had planned to distribute the masks among residents in Sham Shui Po from Saturday. Chan said he had no choice but to cancel the order of all pale yellow masks and procure blue ones which are each costlier by HK$1 more at HK$4.5.  He said their group had to settle for buying 5,000 less masks using the same budgeted amount “just to avoid the yellow colour”. He said that the abrupt change in orders would also result in a delayed delivery and a postponement of planned events to hand out the items.  “When the government itself failed to supply sufficient masks for the residents, it shouldn’t have imposed unnecessary restrictions,” he said. Sham Shui Po district councillor Ramon Yuen Hoi-man, convenor of the council’s working group, accused the Home Affairs Department of not respecting the decisions of the council, as the restrictions were not mentioned when the members had discussed tender specifications earlier in February. Yuen, a member of the Democratic Party, heard some groups had cancelled orders of black masks after the notice. “Civil servants may regard yellow and black as sensitive colours as they were associated with the anti-government protests,” he said. “But the restrictions should not apply to supplies distributed among the public.” The government’s move is against the project objective to respond to the mask shortage swiftly Chris Mak, Sha Tin district councillor In Sha Tin district, a charitable organisation which was allocated HK$2 million to procure masks and sanitisers for mass distribution was also confused about the government notice, councillor Chris Mak Yun-pui said. Mak said as the size of the masks had also been limited to 18cm x 9cm on the notice, charitable organisations could not procure smaller masks for children, or round-shaped masks such as N95 respirators. “All the limitations have added new hurdles to the procurement. The government’s move is against the project objective to respond to the mask shortage swiftly,” he said.   The Sha Tin and Sham Shui Po district offices of the Home Affairs Department told the Post that all procured masks should be light-coloured to so the users could easily spot stains on their surfaces, but failed to explain why yellow was not regarded as a light colour. Post “If the items provided by the approved co-organisers fail to meet the requirements, they cannot be reimbursed for the District Council’s funding,” the Sha Tin office of the Home Affairs Department said.

Three insiders said the effects of the health crisis could be even more serious than the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003. That year, the industry was not yet reliant on mainland China, but now, as cinemas across the border close with the Covid-19 virus infecting more than 77,700 and the death toll beyond 2,300, some have taken to releasing their work on streaming platforms, to mixed views from peers. In an interview with the Post, Tenky Tin Kai-man, chairman of the executive committee of the Federation of Hong Kong Filmmakers, estimated there was zero production of non-documentary films between February and March. Post Tin said creative choices were already hampered even before the outbreak, as police-themed films – once a staple genre – have become a sensitive topic amid the anti-government protests, with the city’s officers now seen as hate figures following accusations of brutality. anti-government protests  Hong Kong has been rocked by protests since last June, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. Tin said his company already suspended two police-themed productions.  “The topic itself has become an obstacle for us in leveraging on our forte,” he said. “So from last year, it has been a chilly winter for the industry.  “But now with the coronavirus outbreak, it’s not just a chilly winter, it’s a coming tsunami.” Hong Kong’s film industry, once dubbed the Hollywood of the East, has been losing its lustre since the 1990s, when production dropped from the heady days of 400 films annually to just 53 in 2018. Nevertheless, the sector remains a strong element in the city’s creative identity. In 2017, local cultural industries accounted for 4.4 per cent of the Hong Kong’s gross domestic product, a 2 per cent increase from the previous year, according to government statistics. The industries employed 213,400 people, or 5.6 per cent of the city’s 3.82 million total payrolls. A boost was initially expected as mainland authorities were set to lift restrictions in June in a much-lauded breakthrough under the Greater Bay Area policy, a plan to develop Hong Kong and 10 other cities in the Guangdong region into a technological and economic powerhouse. set to lift restrictions   Restrictions on issues such as the number of Hong Kong principal creative personnel and artistes on each project, as well as the requirement of mainland-related plots, would be axed in motion pictures co-produced by Hong Kong and the mainland. But Tin said filmmakers now face other tightened screening after the protests. “To some filmmakers, there can be some unnecessary or even more requirements,” he said, referring to the questioning of their political stance. “To some extent, these [restrictions] crippled our wish for room to make more diversified movies or for a more open market.” He said industry players would try to tap into the Film Development Fund, which the government had injected HK$1 billion into last year, while tiding over the slump by churning out scripts. Veteran producer John Chong Ching noted two co-productions, including one starring martial arts superstar Donnie Yen Ji-dan, had halted filming. According to his conservative estimate, all industry work would be delayed three to four months. He said the sector was bracing for a hammering worse than that of Sars. “We are hurt more because we film on the mainland more often,” he said. “In the past, only works in Hong Kong were suspended, but now those across the border have stopped too. So the impact is far-reaching.” Echoing the views, Hong Kong Motion Picture Industry Association chairman Crucindo Hung Cho-sing pointed to the strong reliance on the mainland market. “So far, we haven’t seen lay-offs in the movie industry. But I guess the coming times will be tough. It’s not just about movie production. When cinemas are closed, everyone has no income,” he said. On the mainland, at least seven movies set to debut in theatres during Lunar New Year in January were delayed because of the outbreak, despite heavy marketing in the lead-up to the holiday. Some filmmakers have resort to streaming their productions online, including local director Wong Jing, who produced Enter the Fat Dragon, starring Donnie Yen, and struck a deal with iQiyi, China’s answer to Netflix. Members of the platform pay 6 yuan and non-members 12 yuan to view Wong’s work. Enter the Fat Dragon Hung said not many firms who produced movies costing hundreds of millions of dollars would take up the move because the income online could never cover the investment. But movie investor Johnny Ng Kit-chong said some films streamed online were popular because people now mostly stayed home. During this time, businesses engaging in new economy and internet products would benefit. “For individual cases, they may be able to earn back the money online,” he said. 	SCMP

Chan struck a more optimistic note in a separate blog post on Sunday, saying the economy had rebounded significantly after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) crisis of 2003, as well as after the financial tsunamis of 1998 and 2008. In his budget speech last Wednesday, Chan forecast that gross domestic product would range from a 1.5 per cent decline to growth of just 0.5 per cent. He offered cash handouts, tax breaks and a raft of subsidies in a HK$120 billion (US$15.4 billion) package aimed at easing the financial burden on citizens and injecting new life into the ailing economy. No protesters killed, government says, slamming ‘malicious’ rumours 8 Sep 2019 No protesters killed, government says, slamming ‘malicious’ rumours 8 Sep 2019 Police arrested 71 men and 44 women, aged 15 to 54, over Saturday’s chaos on suspicion of taking part in unauthorised assemblies, possession of offensive weapons and instruments fit for unlawful purpose, arson, attacking police officers and obstructing them in the execution of their duties.    The 23-year-old teacher joined the force two years ago and was based in Kwun Tong, according to a police source. A police spokesman said any officer committing illegal acts would be handled seriously. Police on Sunday also reported an early morning petrol bomb attack on the South Kwai Chung Jockey Club General Outpatient Clinic, which the government condemned as “malicious behaviour” that “caused innocent patients to suffer”. The clinic is one of 18 designated medical facilities for screening patients with minor respiratory symptoms of infection, which protesters do not want in their backyard. Dozens protested outside three other clinics in Shau Kei Wan, Yau Ma Tei and Kowloon Bay, demanding the government find alternatives further away from residential neighbourhoods. Logbook for removal of Prince Edward injured had multiple amendments 18 Sep 2019 Logbook for removal of Prince Edward injured had multiple amendments 18 Sep 2019 Infectious disease expert Professor Gabriel Leung of the University of Hong Kong said it was a matter of practicality and empathy. “Would you rather have these Hong Kong patients walking around on the streets, looking for clinics? Or would you rather have them going to a designated clinic which would be put under very strict protective measures?” he said. “Even if you are selfish, you would want them to seek help as soon as possible.” An officer pulled out his gun and pointed it at radicals attacking him on Saturday, but did not open fire. Police said he drew his weapon because he feared for his life as protesters hurled bricks, stones, bamboo sticks and other hard objects at him. “Rioters began to gather around Nathan Road and Prince Edward Road West yesterday evening, blocking roads, setting fires, vandalising public facilities, hurling petrol bombs and attacking police officers with bricks and hard objects. Several police officers were injured as a result,” the government said on Sunday in an official statement. The trouble broke out when protesters gathered outside Prince Edward MTR station, where they believe demonstrators were killed by police during a clearance operation on August 31, despite repeated official denials and a lack of any evidence.   Officers arrived soon afterwards, clearing flowers that had been placed at exit B1 of the station and urging the crowd to disperse. But about 100 protesters started to block Nathan Road and clashes broke out as the crowd grew in size into the night. Protesters threw petrol bombs and bricks at officers, who responded with tear gas and pepper spray.

The reporter was wearing a press vest and was being cooperative, the outlet said. The government placed the blame squarely on the protesters, saying: “At this difficult juncture, a small number of radicals still conducted violent acts of vandalism which disregard law and order. Their behaviour is outrageous.” Looking at the weekend’s return to protest chaos, political analyst Johnny Lau Yui-siu said the social unrest was bound to continue, as the government had yet to meet protesters’ key demands, including the establishment of an independent judge-led inquiry into allegations of police brutality and amnesty for all those facing prosecution. “It won’t end, though it might take different forms, such as lobbying foreign governments to intervene,” Lau said. “The question is not what the Hong Kong government does to resolve this, but if it wants to do anything ... The authorities have not been listening to public opinion.” More than 7,000 people had been arrested in connection with the unrest since June, which was sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. extradition bill Police have fired more than 16,000 rounds of tear gas and 10,000 rubber bullets.

The 71-year-old founder of the newspaper Apple Daily, and former pro-democracy lawmakers Lee Cheuk-yan and Yeung Sum were arrested for joining a rally, in the form of a prayer walk, from Southorn Playground in Wan Chai to Central on August 31 last year. Apple Daily All three have been charged with taking part in an unauthorised march and will appear at Eastern Court on May 5. Lai separately faces one count of intimidating an Oriental Daily reporter using foul language on June 4, 2017. Oriental Daily As Hong Kong protests raged, police solved lowest percentage of cases in 19 years 28 Feb 2020 As Hong Kong protests raged, police solved lowest percentage of cases in 19 years 28 Feb 2020 “We expect the Hong Kong authorities not to use law enforcement selectively for political purposes, and to handle cases fairly and transparently in a manner that preserves the rule of law and the Hong Kong people’s universal rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said. Ortagus wrote on Twitter the US was “deeply concerned” over the arrests, and that it could have “a chilling effect on freedom of expression in Hong Kong”.  The Chinese foreign ministry’s office in the city criticised the department for making what it called “unwarranted remarks”. In a statement, it said the US was interfering in Hong Kong affairs, affecting its rule of law and judicial independence. “We again urge the US side to immediately stop condoning anti-China suspects who have tried to mess up Hong Kong ... and stop meddling with Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal affairs as a whole,” it said. “Otherwise, the Chinese people, including our Hong Kong compatriots, will definitely fight back.”   “Prosecutors of the DoJ have always been applying the highest professional standards in handling criminal cases and will not be influenced by any investigatory, political, media, community, or individual interest or representation,” the statement continued. “All cases will be handled in the same manner irrespective of the political beliefs, requests and background of the persons involved.” “All cases will be handled in the same manner irrespective of the political beliefs, requests and background of the persons involved.” Lai has a close relationship with the US.

The prayer was for Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, the rally’s organiser had said, adding that the Public Order Ordinance exempted assemblies for religious purposes from needing police approval. Police issued a warning that rally-goers were taking part in an illegal assembly, but made no arrests. A police source argued what had happened eventually was not a religious assembly, but a march. As protests broke out in various districts in the evening, police made arrests at Prince Edward railway station, where they were accused of using excessive force when they stormed a stationary train. British government sounds warning on freedom of speech in Hong Kong 7 Sep 2018 British government sounds warning on freedom of speech in Hong Kong 7 Sep 2018 Legal advice from the Department of Justice was obtained before the arrests, the police source added. The Security Bureau said all arrests by police are made under the law and based on evidence. “All three arrested persons will be subject to the established legal proceedings. Equally, all the arrests were made based on evidence from investigations and strictly according to the laws in force,” it said in a reply. Several US republican lawmakers and Chris Patten, the city’s last governor during British rule, also joined the criticism. Patten said the arrests were “outrageous”, and the action intended to “frighten the community”. “This decision will send yet another signal to the world that the Chinese Communist Party is intent on throttling decency and freedom in Hong Kong,” Patten said on Friday. “China’s priority at the moment should clearly not be turning [the] screws on a city which is celebrated for its commitment to values most of the world accepts.” Michael McCaul, who leads the US House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said he was deeply disturbed by the arrests: “[It is ] a blatant act of political oppression by the Chinese Communist Party.” In response to US legislators’ condemnation, a spokesman for the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong urged the foreigners not to interfere in Hong Kong and Chinese domestic affairs, warning they would “pay the price”. “The US congressmen involved had carried out anti-China activities for a long time and colluded with Hong Kong anti-China plotters who messed up Hong Kong,” its statement read. “The congressmen involved shielded Hong Kong troublemakers, whitewashed their illegal actions, wantonly interfered in the rule of law and judicial independence in Hong Kong, and slandered the central government’s Hong Kong policy.” Taiwan’s foreign minister Joseph Wu Jau-shieh said on Twitter on Friday that Taipei was “saddened” to learn about Lai’s arrest. Apple Daily is also published in Taiwan.

Government and civil servants’ unions opposed that move, saying the pay increase had always been approved as a package. Civic Party lawmaker Kwok Ka-ki said: “None of us are opposed to civil servants’ pay rises, but how dare police still ask for a pay rise after the repeated attacks on our people? We cannot allow a single dime to go to the police.”  Referring to some public sector workers’ support of the anti-government protests, Priscilla Leung Mei-fun of the pro-establishment Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong said: “I’m also very frustrated about individual civil servants’ performance.  “But we won’t oppose to the pay rise, otherwise that will be unfair to civil servants who are holding fast to their role.”   Staff working in the lower and middle levels of the civil service and the force will get a pay rise of 5.26 per cent, while those in the upper ranks will get a 4.75 per cent rise.  Eight amendment motions from the pro-democracy camp, to either freeze the pay rise for police or those in other departments, were also rejected. After the vote, the pro-democracy camp vowed to block the new police payroll announced in the government budget on Wednesday, which showed increasing the force’s headcount by 2,543 to about 38,000 would cost up to HK$22 billion. People Power lawmaker Raymond Chan Chi-chuen said he would not rule out filibustering the budget debate. Scrutiny of the bill will begin in April. “No police have been held accountable over the past few months,” camp convenor Tanya Chan said. But Secretary for the Civil Service Joshua Law Chi-kong said the new additions to the force were based on operational need. “I believe the police have a strong case to argue and support their request,” Law said. Meanwhile, a small crowd gathered for a lunchtime protest on Friday in Central, opposing the police pay rise and criticising the government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. About 20 people gathered at 1pm and chanted slogans in the International Finance Centre. The crowd grew to about 100 at its peak, and dispersed after an hour. They also slammed the HK$10,000 cash handout in the budget, saying it had diverted Hongkongers’ attention from an almost 25 per cent increase in police spending for the coming year. 	SCMP

Apple Daily by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. extradition bill Lai, Lee and Yeung were released on police bail at noon, after being detained at different police stations from around 7am.  They are accused of knowingly joining an illegal assembly on August 31, violating the Public Order Ordinance. Criminal lawyers said the move to charge the trio could be a “test case” to pave the way for more arrests in the future. More than 6,000 people have been arrested in connection with the anti-government protests, which broke out last June, including high-profile activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung and several lawmakers. Lai separately faced one count of intimidating an Oriental Daily reporter using foul language in June 2017, during the June 4 vigil in Victoria Park, Causeway Bay. The rival newspaper said its ­journalist had reported the incident to police and sent 17 letters to the Department of Justice about it. Oriental Daily June 4 vigil  Officers with search warrants also went to the trio’s homes on Friday morning to collect clothing worn on the day of the August 31 rally.   Lai did not respond to inquiries when leaving Kowloon City Police Station, but his top aide and allies in the opposition camp were critical of the timing of the arrest. As it happened: stand-off as protesters vent anger over beatings on train 1 Sep 2019 As it happened: stand-off as protesters vent anger over beatings on train 1 Sep 2019 “With all that Hong Kong is facing, with all the trouble our city is in, how does arresting these three men at this time make any statement, other than [showing that] Beijing and the government want to stir the pot?” Mark Simon, an executive from Lai’s Next Digital Group, said, referring to the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus. coronavirus Yeung said he had no regrets but expressed concern that more arrests would come.

Lawmaker and fellow Democratic Party member Andrew Wan Siu-kin said: “The three were not even organisers. This is clearly political persecution.” Acting senior superintendent Wong Tung-kwong of the Hong Kong Island regional crime unit later confirmed police arrested three Hong Kong men aged between 63 and 72 on suspicion of taking part in an illegal assembly in Wan Chai on August 31 last year, while one of them was also arrested over a criminal intimidation case on Hong Kong Island on June 4, 2017. But Wong did not give details of the three suspects. The assembly on August 31 was originally organised by the Civil Human Rights Front, which has held the city’s biggest anti-government events. But the front cancelled it after losing its appeal against a police ban. losing its appeal   Protesters gathered in different areas of the city regardless that day, before clashes broke out on Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. In the evening, police made arrests at Prince Edward railway station, where they were accused of using excessive force when they stormed a stationary train. One of the rallies held without police approval was a prayer walk from Southorn Playground in Wan Chai to Central, to pray for Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, whom they called a “sinner”. Police at the time issued a warning that those present were participating in an illegal assembly, but no arrests were made immediately. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor Online materials promoting the rally highlighted a provision of the Public Order Ordinance, which states assemblies exclusively held for religious purposes do not require police approval. But a police source said: “What happened that day was a procession. The people were marching on the streets. It was not a public meeting nor gathering as cited in the above mentioned law. “Moreover, we have received legal advice from the Department of Justice, which gave the green light for the arrests.”   Criminal barrister Billy Li On-yin said the trio being charged could be a test case for others who joined similar rallies. “If they can be convicted, I expect more people can be arrested,” Li said. But former deputy director of public prosecutions John Reading and Li both questioned whether the defendants could claim the entire rally was a religious activity. Reading said if they chanted other slogans at the gathering it “may render that unlawful, because that’s not exclusively [a religious purpose]”. The extradition bill protests later morphed into a broader anti-government movement fuelled by allegations of police brutality and the push for greater democracy.

The overall detection rate was 37 per cent, down from 46.5 per cent in 2018. Both the rate and the total number of crimes solved were the lowest since 2001, and it also marked the first overall rise in crime since 2006, when there were 81,125 reports.   While the budget document did not provide a breakdown of the kinds of crime reported, the Post learned there were surges in offences such as robbery, burglary, theft from vehicles, criminal damage and arson. Post Police recorded a fourfold surge in the number of robberies, from 44 cases in the first six months of 2019 to about 160 in the second half of the year. Standing at more than 200, the annual total was up by about 40 per cent from 147 reports in 2018.  Force insiders said the drop in the detection rate was expected because of the number of officers diverted to protest duty. “We don’t have enough manpower to conduct stop-and-search on the streets, investigate quick-cash crimes, and carry out raids against drug dens, gambling establishments and brothels,” one police source said.  He said Hong Kong, Macau and Guangdong police had also suspended their joint, annual crackdown on serious, triad-related crime. The number of raids conducted by police and the number of offenders arrested by uniformed officers were both down year on year, by 41 per cent and 24 per cent respectively.  About a fifth of the force’s 30,000 officers were assigned to anti-riot squads to tackle the unrest sparked by opposition to the government’s now-withdrawn extradition bill. Police stopped foot patrols in August to protect officers from attacks by radical protesters. But from March, sources said, two-thirds of the 6,000 officers redeployed to tackle the protests would be withdrawn from their respective anti-riot squads in two phases on March 1 and 8. One source said the remaining 2,000 officers, including personnel seconded to the Police Tactical Unit and the Special Tactical Squad, also known as Raptors, would remain with them in case of future flare-ups. Break-ins soar as police left short-handed battling anti-government protest 30 Oct 2019 Break-ins soar as police left short-handed battling anti-government protest 30 Oct 2019 He said the assignments were ending because the scale of the protests had shrunk and this would allow more officers to return to regular policing. Once the 4,000 officers returned to their original postings, he said, the force would have sufficient manpower to resume walking the beat. “We will step up enforcement action against crimes such as robbery and burglary once we get manpower back,” a senior officer said, noting the sharp rise in the number of crimes in recent months. The force will revert to the usual three shifts a day, ending a regime of two 12-hour shifts a day brought in when resources were tied up with the protests. But the return to normality will be limited – another source said security measures such as the installation of water-filled barriers at government headquarters in Admiralty, police headquarters in Wan Chai, and various police stations across the city would remain in place. And even if foot patrols resumed, the source said, officers would undertake them in pairs or groups to ensure their safety. Police stop regular foot patrols due to staff crunch and risk of being attacked 31 Aug 2019 Police stop regular foot patrols due to staff crunch and risk of being attacked 31 Aug 2019 “With foot patrols, police can respond quicker in case of any emergency and cover areas that vehicles cannot access,” he said. “The presence of uniformed officers on the streets has a deterrent effect.” Commissioner of Police Chris Tang Ping-keung, who took up the job in November, is expected to hold a press briefing on March 3 to review the overall law-and-order situation. Police and customs officers seized 2.58 tonnes of illegal drugs in 2019, up 85 per cent from 1.39 tonnes in 2018. Seizures of cocaine rose by about 145 per cent to 1.3 tonnes, while those of crystal meth and ketamine were up 170 per cent to 798kg. There was a 26 per cent rise in seizures of heroin, with 62kg of the drug netted in 2019. “It is possible international drug dealers thought local authorities were busy dealing with the social unrest and deployed fewer officers to carry out inspections and investigation, so they shipped illegal drugs into the city,” a law enforcement source said.

At a Legislative Council Finance Committee meeting on Thursday, Paul Chan Mo-po rejected calls from two major political parties to pull the handout scheme from the appropriation bill, which contains funding applications for all measures announced in the budget a day earlier. Both the pro-establishment Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), and the opposition Civic Party, said such a move would help the government deliver the handout sooner. The latter also said the handout should not be grouped with increased police funding in the appropriation bill. Anger as Hongkongers abroad to get cash handout, while recent immigrants miss out 27 Feb 2020 Anger as Hongkongers abroad to get cash handout, while recent immigrants miss out 27 Feb 2020 Chan’s latest budget revealed a 24.7 per cent increase in expenditure for police to HK$25.8 billion, drawing criticism from the pro-democracy camp. While the force will record the largest number of new posts across all government departments, it ranks only 14th in percentage growth in expenditure.  The 30,000-strong police force is to get a headcount boost of more than 2,500, up by 7 per cent. On Thursday, Chan said he would not consider the proposal, saying: “It is not possible to speed up the preparation work for the handout scheme even if Legco gave it a faster approval.”  He said it would take time for the government to liaise with banks to set up the administrative and technological framework for distributing the cash.  The goal is to start distributing the handout during the summer holidays, he added. During the two-hour session, pan-democrats said the government had bundled the handout with the increased budget for police, with some describing the payout as “hush money” for poor governance.  “Are you transforming Hong Kong further into a police state?” Chu said. Chu also accused Chan of being a “coward” for burying the police funding only in the appendix of the budget document, and not mentioning it in his speech. Summarising their experience, [police] think they need to replenish their manpower and equipment. I think it is reasonable Paul Chan, financial secretary Labour Party’s Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung said the government was trying to redeem itself by giving the handout. “The money is from the public and not the government,” he said. “You can’t expiate your sins, as misgovernance has caused a serious viral outbreak.” Six things to know about the Hong Kong budget 26 Feb 2020 Six things to know about the Hong Kong budget 26 Feb 2020 DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat Pui-fan accused the opposition of putting politics before livelihood issues. “They said they would oppose all relief measures and the handout if police were given more resources. That’s ridiculous,” she said, adding many residents were in need of the cash. The finance minister refused to go into details of the police funding, and said security officials would give further explanation in a later meeting. “The handout scheme is not related to resources for police,” Chan said. He said the adjustments were made after considering requests from police for more resources, in light of the months-long anti-government protests that regularly involved violent clashes between protesters and officers. months-long anti-government protests “Summarising their experience, [police] think they need to replenish their manpower and equipment.

An inquiry by Confucius Hall Secondary School’s management committee found teacher Ho Pak-yan guilty of serious negligence and a lack of professionalism, but spared him dismissal as he was unaware of the text’s message and said he was sorry for sharing it. Breaking his silence in a newspaper statement published on Thursday, Ho apologised for the distress caused to the school and anyone affected by the incident. “[I] did not want to deliberately hurt anyone,” he said. But Ho also said the “untrue claims” and personal attacks on him and his family were regrettable.  Ho shared the Cantonese poem on Facebook in the early hours of Sunday, part of which read “being blackhearted is not so good, cops are just doing their jobs”. Another section read “whole community should come together and fight the epidemic as the most effective thing to do, family support is also very important”. Hong Kong protests: teachers warned online comments are subject to regulations 9 Jan 2020 Hong Kong protests: teachers warned online comments are subject to regulations 9 Jan 2020 Unbeknown to the former deputy school head, the first word of each of the poem’s 11 lines spelt out “rogue cops and families go to hell, not one member less”. The poem quickly spread across social media over the weekend after a riot police officer on Thursday contracted the deadly coronavirus, which causes the disease Covid-19. Some 50 other police who attended a banquet with him were placed under quarantine.  Despite deleting the post that morning, Ho was suspended on Monday. The Education Bureau contacted the school over the incident on the same day.  In the subsequent internal investigation, Ho told the committee the text did not originate with him, and that he had shared it to show genuine support for the city’s efforts in combating the coronavirus. A school statement posted on Facebook after the probe said the teacher was “deeply sorry”. “Mr Ho Pak-yan expressed remorse for this reckless sharing, and felt disturbed by how the incident had brought negative impacts to the school,” the statement said.

Still, one of the city’s largest police groups, the Junior Police Officers’ Association (JPOA), issued a statement on Thursday questioning Ho’s morals, and demanding the bureau take action. “Ho’s acts have already reflected that he is completely unqualified and should no longer teach and nurture students,” the association said. The bureau reiterated in a reply on Wednesday that teachers should not make statements that “breach publicly acceptable morals and values”, and violators might face warnings or even disqualification. “We emphasise that this is not to restrain teachers from expressing their views on social incidents or political ideals,” a bureau spokeswoman said. “Be it in Western countries or Hong Kong, freedom of speech is not free of boundaries, [and it] must be exercised reasonably and lawfully, while respecting others.” The bureau had requested the school file a report on the incident, the spokeswoman added. Latest figures from the Education Bureau showed that of 147 complaints received about teachers’ behaviour between June and December of last year, wrongdoing had been confirmed in 65 cases. Of those, follow-up action had been taken in 32 instances, including the issuing of warnings and condemnation letters. 	SCMP

The figures also showed that police overtime pay and other allowances in the 2019/20 financial year soared to HK$2.5 billion (US$321 million), 10 times the original estimate of HK$256 million. While the force will record the largest number of new posts across all government departments, it ranked only 14th in percentage growth in expenditure. The three government wings primed to spend the most are the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, which will oversee the HK$10,000 cash handouts to all adult Hongkongers, the Housing Department and the Environment Bureau. Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po’s budget proposal on Wednesday showed that boosting police headcount by 2,543, adding to its 35,000-strong workforce, would cost HK$21.9 billion, raising operating expenses by 24.7 per cent for the coming financial year. The Independent Police Complaints Council, meanwhile, received 4.4 per cent less funding than last year, with a drop from HK$105 million to HK$100 million. The police watchdog said the larger budget last year was because of its involvement in a TV drama series.  A police source said the force’s new posts were to cope with operational needs arising from the possibility of more social unrest. Hong Kong has been rocked by anti-government protests since last June, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. CORONAVIRUS UPDATE Get updates direct to your inbox SUBSCRIBE The coronavirus epidemic in the city has further heightened anti-mainland China sentiment and distrust in the government, over its handling of the health crisis.  A high-ranking police officer said he believed the creation of the new posts would be the biggest manpower boost for the force since 1997, when the city returned to Chinese rule.  But he said it would be a “great challenge” to recruit new staff as fewer candidates might come forward because of the force’s battered image and troubled relationship with the public, arising from the months of unrest.

But he added that the requirements to select candidates would not be lowered. Another senior officer said police branches to be boosted included the crime unit, patrol sub-unit and Police Tactical Unit. He said crime squad officers were currently busy handling protest-related cases as more than 7,000 people had been arrested, including for rioting, possessing explosives or firearms without a licence, arson, criminal damage and unlawful assembly. Hong Kong coronavirus protest: Disruption near quarantine sites close to residential areas Hong Kong coronavirus protest: Disruption near quarantine sites close to residential areas Since last August, the force has had to suspend patrols, with manpower stretched by handling protests.

The force will also replace six more armoured vehicles in the coming year, each at a cost of about HK$12.7 million. The Post has reached to police for a response.

From time to time protesters still gather in the hundreds and attack our stations. “It is important to strengthen manpower to maintain law and order.” But pro-democracy lawmakers questioned if police really needed the funding boost. Civic Party leader Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu said his party would vote against the appropriation bill if the increase in police spending remained part of the entire budget. “I do not see the urgency of that,” Yeung said. Democratic Party chairman Wu Chi-wai echoed the sentiment, saying the government had failed to respond to calls to reform the force.

Should we also urge the removal of its budget? We do not plan to do so,” Chan said. Meanwhile, the Information Services Department will spend 53 per cent more on international promotion in the coming financial year, with an estimated total expense of HK$226 million. The department said this was based on analysis showing that the social unrest “raised concerns about Hong Kong’s positioning as a global business and financial hub”.

But the budget also forecast an all-time high deficit of HK$139 billion for the coming year and Chan could not but sound a stern warning on the challenges ahead. Here are six things to know about this year’s budget. 1. Cash for all “exceptional measure in unique circumstances” 1. Cash for all “exceptional measure in unique circumstances” Bowing to public demand, Chan announced a HK$10,000 cash handout to all permanent residents aged 18 or above. The total bill: HK$71.1 billion (US$9.1 billion). A month ago, before Hong Kong was yet to record its first coronavirus infection case, Chan was resisting politicians’ united call for cash to relieve suffering amid a growing economic downturn. He said people might get angry if the amount was too little and he had also to take into account the fiscal burden.  But on Wednesday, Chan insisted the handout was only a one-off and would not put a permanent dent in the city’s coffers. “I consider that, with ample fiscal reserves, the government has to increase public expenditure amid an economic downturn to stimulate the economy and ride out the difficult times with members of the public,” he says.  The announcement was immediately welcomed by all lawmakers and people in the street. 2. Full guarantee on loans for businesses 2. Full guarantee on loans for businesses Chan said the government would provide for a full guarantee on loans of up to HK$2 million per case to help small and medium-sized businesses pay wages and rent. The application period will last six months and the repayment period will be up to three years.  The measure adds to the cash bailouts in the HK$30 billion package announced by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor that aimed to support industries hit hard by the epidemic. Lam’s plan was criticised by some as doing little to help, as members of the business community said loan guarantees, not cash, would help them survive in the long run. It is believed they would welcome the budget measure. 3. A whole chapter on strengthening the health care system 3. A whole chapter on strengthening the health care system The coronavirus outbreak has exposed problems in the medical system including a lack of quarantine facilities and medical mask storage, and the long-standing problem of a staff shortage in public hospitals. Giving health care a full chapter this year, the financial secretary said the government should plan ahead to enhance the capability of the system to prevent and treat infectious diseases, such as building additional medical and quarantine facilities, increasing its stock of supplies as well as strengthening scientific research on infectious disease prevention and control. Also noting the social unrest and the epidemic had affected the mental health of many, Chan would allocate sufficient resources for providing appropriate support to those suffering from emotional distress. Overall, the government will continue to increase the recurrent funding for the Hospital Authority by HK$3 billion in the coming year, and an additional funding of about HK$600 million would be provided to the HA for increasing manpower. A total recurrent funding of HK$75 billion will be provided to the HA in 2020/21, representing an increase of 35 per cent over the provision of HK$55.6 billion in 2017/18. 4. Plans to boost the economy to keep pace 4. Plans to boost the economy to keep pace Despite the focus on battling the epidemic and immediate bailouts, planned initiatives to develop the economy remain on the blueprint. For example, Lantau Tomorrow Vision, an ambitious project to build massive artificial islands as Hong Kong’s next housing and business hub, will continue. “I understand people are worried about the financial burden the project will bring, but I want to assure you that the government is confident and capable of controlling spending on public works and keeping it within affordable levels,” Chan said. Other plans include a further injection to a “re-industrialisation funding scheme” to support manufacturers to set up new “smart” production lines; a HK$200 million Green Tech Fund will be set up to support research and development in decarbonisation and green technologies; and an extra HK$900 million to a matching grants scheme to promote sponsorship of culture and art. 5. Sweeteners as usual, with some enjoying full tax waivers 5. Sweeteners as usual, with some enjoying full tax waivers Like previous years, sweeteners including tax concessions, rate waivers, discounts in water and electricity bills and even a waiver of students’ examination fees will be given. But some employees and employers may be happy to find they will not have to pay for their salary tax or profits tax. The full waiver is subject to a ceiling of HK$20,000 in both cases. But with the deficit, Chan warned: “The one-off relief measures may also have to be progressively reduced.” 6. Record-breaking deficit: daring spending but at what cost? 6. Record-breaking deficit: daring spending but at what cost? Chan conceded the rapid growth in government expenditure in recent years is “not sustainable”. The government ran a fiscal deficit in 2019/2020, the first time in 15 years, and will have a record budget deficit of HK$139 billion in 2020/21, accounting for 4.8 per cent of the estimated GDP and well beyond the government’s fiscal principle of keeping it below 3 per cent. The fiscal reserves, now equivalent to 22 months of government expenditure (2019/20), will drop to 16 months in the next financial year. And Chan expected the government would continue to record a deficit for the next five years. When she became chief executive in July 2017, Lam pledged a “new fiscal philosophy” which emphasised “daring” spending to maintain Hong Kong’s competitiveness. Part of that bold approach in the past two years had been to foster innovation and improve education and welfare, and the majority of next year’s deficit is to extricate the economy from difficult times. But how will both, especially the latter, be funded over time? The answer from Chan’s remarks as the person holding the city’s purse strings suggested while it would remain a case of daring spending, there had to be a dose of discipline. He said: “We will focus on the optimal use of resources to implement the committed initiatives in an orderly and effective manner so that the public will see progressive improvements in public services and social infrastructure. “As for future increases in spending, we should be more mindful of the government’s long-term affordability. It should also be commensurate with the increase in revenue.” 	SCMP

The ban has since been held up in court proceedings. Cheng will face a maximum prison term of 4½ years, a fine of HK$37,500 and the loss of his licence, if the court is satisfied there is sufficient evidence to begin private prosecution proceedings, a rare measure allowed for under Section 14 of the Magistrates Ordinance. “When police witness a crime so obvious that an ordinary person can tell [but decide not to prosecute], we have to do our job to file our case,” Hui said at a press conference. “We believe we have sufficient evidence to bring Cheng Kwok-chuen to justice.” The case involving Cheng was one of four being investigated by Hui, who last month launched criminal proceedings against the police officer who shot a protester with a live round in November. The lawmaker said he had received HK$3.4 million from about 8,000 donors through crowdfunding to support the investigations.  The Magistrates Ordinance empowers individuals not acting on behalf of the secretary for justice to initiate their own criminal prosecutions in the capacity of either a complainant or informant. However, such prosecutions are very rare, and ultimate control rests with the secretary for justice, who can choose to take over the case at any point or stop it entirely by refusing to endorse the indictment. The court filing said that at about 5.16pm on the day in question, Cheng had driven his vehicle towards a crowd of protesters at the junction of Cheung Sha Wan Road and Yen Chow Street in Sham Shui Po, but stopped before a collision. The vehicle was then surrounded by protesters.  But the car then suddenly took off, ploughing into the pedestrian walkway of Yen Chow Street and ramming into a shop, knocking down some protesters and passers-by, according to the filing. Cheng was then pulled from the car and beaten unconscious by vigilantes.  Cheng was not charged by the Department of Justice, though two others who allegedly took part in the beating were separately charged with rioting, wounding with intent and wearing facial coverings at an unlawful assembly. No pleas have yet been entered in those cases. Lawmaker files case against officer who shot protester in rare private prosecution 23 Jan 2020 Lawmaker files case against officer who shot protester in rare private prosecution 23 Jan 2020 Hui said the department’s decision to not prosecute Cheng was itself a form of police brutality and a grave injustice to those injured by the collision, one of whom, according to the lawmaker, suffered fractures in both legs. Hui plans to call three witnesses, including Senior Inspector Billy Ng Chun-yiu, a police officer who was involved in the investigation of the incident. In a letter to Eastern Magistracy’s Principal Magistrate Bina Chainrai, Hui said the prosecution would very likely rely on Ng’s testimony in relation to his handling of the case. Whether Ng would support their allegations against Cheng, however, was an open question, he admitted. In response, Cheng on Monday dismissed Hui’s legal bid as “frivolous” and reiterated what he previously told the Post – that he had lost control of his taxi when it rammed into the crowd. Post – Cheng, who has since resumed work as a taxi driver, said he could offer no compensation to those injured because he had been declared bankrupt by the court. He added that he had never received monetary support from anyone after the incident. Police declined to comment on the case.

Confucius Hall Secondary School in Causeway Bay said an investigation task force had been set up to look into teacher Ho Pak-yan’s case. The first word of each of the Cantonese poem’s 11 lines spelt out “black cops, hope your whole family dies and not one member less”. Part of the poem, which was widely shared across social media over the weekend, reads, “blackhearted is not such a good thing, cops are just doing their jobs”, and “whole community should come together and fight the epidemic as the most effective thing to do, family’s support is also very important”. But school head Yeung Wing-hon told the Post the teacher had mistakenly shared the poem on Saturday without realising the acrostic elements in it, and had immediately deleted the post once he had been notified of the problem. Post Last Thursday, a riot police officer contracted Covid-19 for the first time and more than 50 others who attended a recent banquet with him were placed under quarantine.  “I have met Ho and he said he had posted [the poem] on Saturday night,” Yeung said. “By [Sunday] noon, someone told him that there were problems with the poem and he had immediately deleted it, but it had already gone out. “Ho said he had no idea at all [it was an acrostic poem].”  In a written statement on Monday, the school’s incorporated management committee said Ho had been suspended pending investigation, adding that Ho’s remarks were solely personal and he had not sought the school’s approval before sharing the poem.  The school had always believed politics should not be brought into school premises, the statement added.   Yeung said the teacher had only posted the poem on his personal Facebook and it was supposed to just be seen by his friends, adding the suspension was a matter of procedure. “If a person is under investigation, he or she would be suspended during the period and it usually takes one to two weeks,” he said. Ho’s post was later being shared across other social media websites, with various users calling for others to lodge complaints to his school and the Education Bureau. On Monday, the bureau said that it had contacted the school over the incident, and would take action if necessary. “If a teacher‘s remarks are against the moral standards or values that society upholds, for instance involving hate speech, even if they are made outside school, the bureau is responsible for handling them according to each case’s seriousness if they are in fact found to be true,” a bureau spokeswoman added. Hong Kong police confirms first coronavirus case within the force Hong Kong police confirms first coronavirus case within the force The Professional Teachers’ Union (PTU), and the Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers, both urged the school to investigate the teacher’s case in a fair and just manner. The PTU also said it could help the teacher, depending on his needs. Latest figures from the Education Bureau showed that out of 147 complaints received over teachers’ behaviour between June and December last year, wrongdoing had been confirmed in 65 case. Of those, follow-up action had been taken in 32 instances, including issuing warnings and condemnation letters. Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung had previously said teachers’ comments in private social media domains were also subjected to professional misconduct rules, because they could reflect a teacher’s personality and value judgement. Last month, a teacher at Tak Sun Secondary School in Ma On Shan was suspended for two weeks after referring to anti-government protesters as “cockroaches”, and using foul language in front of students.

The pair were among 7,165 men and women arrested over the demonstrations that began on June 9 last year, according to official figures as of January 24. Among them, about 1,120 people have been prosecuted, with 552 of them facing a rioting charge, punishable by 10 years’ imprisonment. Without giving any reasons, prosecutors on Friday applied to withdraw the charge against construction worker Lau Chun-hing, 33, and salesman Cheung Man-wai, 34. Both cases relate to a police-approved march in Kwun Tong on August 24 last year, when more than 1,000 people gathered calling for the full withdrawal of the now-shelved extradition bill and demanding an explanation over a plan to set up “smart lamp posts” along roads.  But the peaceful demonstration turned ugly when some deviated from the approved route as protests erupted in surrounding districts, from Kowloon Bay to Ngau Tau Kok and Wong Tai Sin, all the way to Sham Shui Po. Protests continue to grip Hong Kong Protests continue to grip Hong Kong Defence lawyers demanded legal costs but faced objections from senior public prosecutor Vincent Lee Ting-wai, who argued the defendants had drawn suspicion to themselves. Relying on police statements, Lee said Lau wore a helmet, face mask and protective gear when police caught him running from Ngau Tau Kok Police Station during a clearance operation following repeated warnings for the crowd to disperse.  The prosecutor also noted that Cheung was found on a site where protesters were jeering and throwing objects at police officers.  This explanation, however, prompted Lau’s counsel to question why prosecutors chose not to proceed with lesser charges, such as unlawful assembly. He also observed that his client could be accused of drawing suspicion even if he did not run away, as prosecutors could then say the defendant remained at the crime scene. “So should he run away or not?” the lawyer asked. Violence in Hong Kong as city endures 20th straight weekend of anti-government protests Violence in Hong Kong as city endures 20th straight weekend of anti-government protests Cheung’s counsel further argued that he was “only a few steps away” from the approved route when police stopped him, and noted that he was wearing a suit and a pair of leather shoes at the time. Acting principal magistrate Ivy Chui Yee-mei agreed to withdraw the charges and granted costs to both men. Leaving court, Cheung said he felt relieved but not particularly happy. “Many other people are still being prosecuted,” he said. Meanwhile, construction worker Tsai Sai-hung, 47, was jailed following a guilty plea to one count of wounding and another count of possession of offensive weapon in public place. The father of two admitted that he had swung a hammer at a young man – leaving him with an injury to his upper lip requiring stitches – upon being confronted by a crowd for tearing paper from a Lennon Wall in Lam Tin while he was on his way home after drinking four to five cans of beer on August 15. He wrote to the court expressing remorse, with a promise to stop drinking and to undergo therapy for anger management. He also apologised to the victim and offered compensation but that was rejected by the man. The magistrate accepted that Tsai was remorseful and that he had been drinking, but said the influence of alcohol could not mitigate the fact he had used a weapon that could easily injure those around him. “The court must point out that one should not use violence against people of different political views,” Chui said.

The city had no new confirmed infections to report on Friday, with the total remaining at 69, but the police infection scare prompted health authorities to warn against large social gatherings. “As there are now more cases and the situation is becoming more complicated, we will ask police to help us with their supercomputer,” Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan of the Centre for Health Protection said. She was referring to the police force’s Major Incident Investigation and Disaster Support System, which was used during the 2003 Sars epidemic for contact tracing and determining areas of high infection risk. One more Hongkonger infected on Diamond Princess, total at 66 One more Hongkonger infected on Diamond Princess, total at 66 However, Chuang noted that the city was still not experiencing a community outbreak. Asked what action was being taken in response to the infection scare, the police force said: “In accordance with the epidemic prevention guidelines and recommendations issued by related government departments ... police officers are reminded to maintain social distance and we will release latest information to them in a timely manner.”  The first police officer to contract the coronavirus, a senior constable stationed in North Point and living with his wife in the disciplined staff quarters at Yau Mei Court in Yau Tong, tested positive on Thursday. He had no travel history over the past 14 days and was on leave when he felt unwell on Tuesday. He is now being treated at United Christian Hospital in Kwun Tong, while his wife and mother-in-law have also been sent to hospital after developing symptoms.    The officer and his family had eaten at the shop previously, but Chuang said it was still unclear whether they had any close contact with the cashier.  “We will try to trace his movements before he showed symptoms, perhaps using his Octopus card records,” she said.  The infected policeman was assigned to the riot squad under the Hong Kong Island regional response contingent, comprising some 40 officers. A source said members of the squad were not categorised as close contacts, but had been screened for fever when they reported for duty and were required to wear masks. They were also deployed in operations with no public interaction. Coronavirus: new infections in Hubei prisons reverse China’s downtrend in new Covid-19 cases Coronavirus: new infections in Hubei prisons reverse China’s downtrend in new Covid-19 cases All officers at North Point Police Station were required to undergo temperature checks before starting work there from Friday morning, according to another source. The force had also cleaned and sanitised the station, related facilities and vehicles, as well as the disciplined service quarters at Yau Mei Court. But the bigger concern was the fallout from the banquet on Tuesday night that the infected constable attended with 59 others, after four of them were sent to hospital with symptoms such as sore throats, runny noses and diarrhoea. Thirty-six officers at the banquet were on duty at Aberdeen Police Station on February 20 when the constable was confirmed to be infected. Police management said they had immediately suspended them from duty to await quarantine orders. Hongkonger opens face mask factory as shortage continues amid coronavirus epidemic Hongkonger opens face mask factory as shortage continues amid coronavirus epidemic The other 23 officers who attended the banquet were attached to Commercial Crime Bureau and different districts on the Hong Kong Island. Police Commissioner Chris Tang Ping-keung and other top brass have come under fire after they were seen in videos clips posted online attending a banquet on Sunday. Several pro-establishment celebrities such as filmmakers and actors Jackie Chan and Eric Tsang Chi-wai, and veteran singer Alan Tam Wing-lun, were also at the event. Hong Kong Medical Association president Dr Ho Chung-ping said he did not think it was necessary for the government or the police force to issue guidelines on attending large social gatherings, but stressed the need to exercise caution. “The association’s advice is still the same – practise social distancing and avoid casual social gatherings. Of course, in the case of the police officer, it was a farewell, which is harder to reschedule,” Ho said. “If you must attend functions such as farewells and weddings, be on high alert and use common sense and wear a surgical mask until you need to eat.”   Police were in the spotlight once again on Friday as small groups of anti-government protesters gathered to mark seven months since a violent mob attack on demonstrators and passengers at Yuen Long MTR station. This time, in addition to the usual condemnation of police for their failure to prevent the mob attacks last July, protesters broke out champagne and beer to “celebrate” the first coronavirus infection in the force. There were standoffs and scuffles at small protests in the shopping district of Causeway Bay and the industrial neighbourhoods of Cheung Sha Wan and Kwun Tong, each of which drew a few dozen participants. In Times Square in Causeway Bay, a handful of pro-Beijing supporters with a Chinese flag argued and scuffled briefly with protesters before police arrived. “Any organisation that has attracted so much hate to the point that someone would take pleasure in its members getting a disease must surely reflect on its conduct,” said Ray Wong Cheuk-hei, a waiter in the neighbourhood. Lam Chi-wai, chairman of the Junior Police Officers’ Association, said the protesters’ “undignified and inhumane” remarks did not even warrant his condemnation. Health authorities were also experiencing difficulty tracing the contacts of a 58-year-old taxi driver who was confirmed as the city’s 68th case. The taxi driver had a fever for two weeks, but carried on working, prompting authorities to look for all those who had boarded his vehicle – licence number JW9897 – between January 25 and February 16. The driver recalled taking passengers to shopping malls and picking up fares from border crossings such as Lok Ma Chau, Shenzhen Bay Port and the Hong Kong-Macau-Zhuhai Bridge, Chuang said. 	SCMP

David Li, a protest co-organiser in his early 20s, said: “The police are now paying for their brutality in the past months in handling protests. We finally have something to be happy about amid the virus outbreak.” Gloris Chan, a regular participant at lunchtime protests, accused the force of stockpiling face masks and protective gear during the epidemic, pointing to a recent media report that said the force received the second-largest batch of masks among all government departments. the epidemic She said the case of the infected riot police officer, who had been at a large dinner party with fellow officers, reflected the department’s unprofessionalism.  “The police force should be the most disciplined group in society [when it comes to avoiding] gatherings, as they have high risk in spreading germs when patrolling on the street,” she said. “I won’t feel sad about the infection.” On Thursday night, health authorities confirmed that a 48-year-old policeman had caught the novel coronavirus that causes the disease Covid-19. His wife and mother-in-law also showed symptoms of infection, and were taken to hospital, while 59 other officers in attendance also had to be quarantined.  As soon as the news broke, social media was awash with jubilation and celebration, with some saying it was “karma”. Back at Landmark, participants stepped on a T-shirt printed with a photo of police chief Chris Tang Ping-keung, accusing him of not holding officers accountable for their non-action in the July 21 Yuen Long mob attack.  Monica Tung, an office worker at a finance company in Central, said: “I came out to tell the police that despite all the news in recent months being about the virus, we will not forget what happened seven months ago when officers did nothing to help our people.” Hong Kong had 69 reported cases of infection as of Friday afternoon, with two fatalities. While the crowd in Central dispersed peacefully after a toast, there were standoffs and skirmishes at protests in the shopping district of Causeway Bay and the industrial neighbourhoods of Cheung Sha Wan and Kwun Tong, each of which drew a few dozen participants. In Kwun Tong, half an hour after demonstrations began, dozens of police officers turned up, stopping and searching participants, before taking away at least one protester. In Times Square in Causeway Bay, a handful of counterprotesters holding a Chinese flag argued and scuffled briefly with anti-government protesters, pushing one woman to the ground, before officers arrived. Ray Wong Cheuk-hei, 20, who works as a waiter in the area, also said he had no sympathy for the infected police officer. “Any organisation who has attracted so much hate to the point that someone would take pleasure in its members getting a disease must surely reflect on its conduct,” he said. “Some are popping champagne today because an officer was caught on camera … making the same mocking remarks when one of our protesters Chow Tsz-lok died,” he added. Chow, a university student, died in a fall from a Tseung Kwan O car park near a police operation in November. died in a fall from a Tseung Kwan O car park Lam Chi-wai, chairman of the Junior Police Officers’ Association, said the protesters’ “undignified and inhumane” remarks on Friday did not even warrant his condemnation. “At this critical time in the city, we must all put our hands together and join forces to fight the epidemic. I will not dignify those comments with a reply.” 	SCMP

Calling it a “political coronavirus”, Luo also condemned “a few people” behind the strike by Hong Kong medical workers over the response to the outbreak, and said as long as border checkpoints remained open, ample food and hygiene supplies would continue to flow into the city. A summary of the letter, which marked the first time a director of the liaison office had addressed the delegates by email, was posted on social media – also a first for the office. In the excerpts posted online, Luo said he had turned to the internet to connect with Hong Kong’s 36 NPC deputies and more than 120 CPPCC delegates because of the coronavirus outbreak, and said: “What we need to quarantine is the virus, not hearts.” The letter told the delegates that they should have confidence in winning the battle against the coronavirus, which has infected over 70,000 people and killed more than 2,000 since it was discovered in Wuhan, in central China, in December. discovered in Wuhan  Luo criticised “a few people, at this moment, still creating all kinds of conflicts for political self-interest, and even manipulating strikes to ‘save Hong Kong’.

Luo said it was made possible only through the joint efforts of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Hong Kong government and Hong Kong lawmakers of the establishment camp.

Hong Kong lawmaker Tanya Chan, the convenor of the pro-democracy group in the city’s Legislative Council, said Luo should not point the finger at medical staff but should look at the roots of the crisis. “That’s a systemic problem in the mainland, with officials covering up the outbreak in the beginning,” Chan said. “The governance has been ineffective.” Noting that Luo had highlighted Beijing’s offer to help send masks to the city, Chan said: “We thank China for the masks, but not the virus.” Coronavirus: desperate scenes as 10,000 queue for masks in Hong Kong Coronavirus: desperate scenes as 10,000 queue for masks in Hong Kong Luo’s letter was his second public attempt in less than a week to drum up support in Hong Kong over the coronavirus outbreak.

The eight words in Chinese – “Liberate Hong Kong; Revolution of our times” – were found daubed on the external walls of Gun Club Hill Barracks in Jordan at 5.30pm. “Liberate Hong Kong; Revolution of our times” Police officers arrived at the barracks and found no suspects, after a passer-by called emergency services. By Wednesday evening, an investigation was under way and no one had been arrested. Footprints were found on a box, which police believed the vandal might have stood on when writing the graffiti. Hong Kong has been gripped since June by an anti-government protest movement, sparked by opposition to a proposed piece of extradition legislation. The unrest grew into a broad movement for greater democracy and accountability, with frequent violent street clashes between police and protesters. Use of the revolutionary slogan – a regular refrain of protesters – has in the past month touched a nerve with the authorities.  Both Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and Beijing said it threatened the foundation of “one country, two systems”, the framework under which the city is ruled by the central government but promised a measure of autonomy. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has not replied to a request for comment on the vandalism.

The force earlier denied the allegation, saying it was based on misinformation. It also wrote to RTHK heads to express its displeasure. denied the allegation In a press statement on Tuesday, the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, which oversees RTHK, also noted that the director of broadcasting should be held accountable for decisions taken by the station’s producers. “The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development urges RTHK to strictly abide by the charter to provide public broadcasting services,” the statement read. The broadcasting charter states that RTHK must adhere to editorial principles of accuracy and impartiality. A screenshot from RTHK’s satirical current affairs programme Headliner. A screenshot from RTHK’s satirical current affairs programme Headliner. The controversy centred on an episode last Friday of the satirical current affairs television programme Headliner, in which suggestions were made that police were hoarding protective gear while leaving other government agencies and health care workers short of masks amid the coronavirus outbreak. Headliner  Broadcasting watchdog the Office of the Communications Authority received more than 200 complaints against the programme since Saturday, according to the bureau, which added that the authority was following up on the cases.   On Sunday police slammed the allegations and argued that a large supply was needed for its 40,000-strong workforce, especially when the daily duties of officers involved interaction with members of the public, such as people in quarantine camps or at border checkpoints. The force said most officers were only given one mask a day, and supplies could only last for about a week.  Also on Sunday, police wrote to opposition lawmaker Kwok Ka-ki, complaining about his claims they were stockpiling masks and protective medical gear. Kwok countered that he had only cited what was reported in the news. On Tuesday, about 60 members from the group Alliance in Support of Our Police Force staged a rally outside government headquarters in Admiralty. They said the RTHK programme had “smeared” the force and its anti-epidemic efforts, calling for the station to be shut down.  An RTHK spokesman said it would follow established mechanisms to handle the complaints, but did not elaborate. The RTHK Programme Staff Union also declined to comment. Former lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen, who sits on the board of advisers to RTHK, said he was concerned about the recent complaints by police against the station, adding that the row among government entities “would not give the public a good impression”. “We expect RTHK management to report the case to us at a later meeting,” Tik said. He declined to comment further, citing interference with the handling of the complaints. RTHK board chairman Eugene Chan Kin-keung also wrote to police chief Chris Tang Ping-keung, saying it would follow up on the complaint by the force. Chan said RTHK head Leung ka-wing would be called upon to present his views, with “appropriate advice” to be given to him after deliberation among board members. Chan further wrote: “The board has on many occasions advised the director that RTHK programmes should comply with the provisions of the charter, and have on occasions, advised that where there is a balance [between] chasing ratings and compliance with the charter, the charter is paramount, specifically in relation to [Headliner].” Headliner 	SCMP

Celebrities such as filmmakers and actors Jackie Chan, Eric Tsang Chi-wai, and veteran singer Alan Tam Wing-lun attended the event. They are known for their ardent support of the government and police in the handling of the social unrest triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. extradition bill Other police figures – including Chief Superintendent John Tse Chun-chung, who was former head of the Police Public Relations Branch and Senior Superintendent Kelvin Kong Wing-cheung – also attended the event. In a compliment given during his speech, Tang was seen jokingly saying to actors Chan and Alex Fong Chung-sun: “I learned everything from you. I didn’t know how to be a policeman. I learned it while watching [your films].”  Both Chan and Fong are famous for their officer roles in action thrillers. Tang also paid tribute to Tsang and Tam. “I am excited tonight, because Jackie, Alan and Eric are my idols.”  He also told Tam in jest: “I hate you very much, Alan, because my wife loves you more than she loves me. Yet there’s nothing I can do, because I love you too.”  Putting his hand on Tsang’s shoulder, the police chief said: “Do you know why I was [so] eloquent at the district council meetings? Because I learned it from Eric’s [comedy shows].” Tang was referring to the Central and Western District Council meeting, and the Tsuen Wan District Council meeting, on January 16 and 22, respectively. At the January 16 meeting, Tang rejected calls for the force to apologise for their alleged violence during the months-long social unrest and declared that it was the “rioters” who should say sorry for the harm they had caused to the city. At the January 22 meeting, he again crossed swords with district councillors from the opposition over the force’s handling of the protests and refuted allegations that he had close ties with rural powers during his time as the district commander of Yuen Long. He was seen stressing that members of the entertainment sector were close associates of police.

The well-known song Friends of Mine (1985) from Tam was also sung by Tang, Chan, and Tsang.

But the bloc, which will make a much-anticipated announcement this week on the role of artificial intelligence (AI), will stop short of imposing an outright ban, a top official said. On Wednesday, the European Commission will set the stage for European rules on the subject with innovation in the growing sector so far dominated by the US and China. The commission, the EU’s powerful regulator, is eager to answer the worries of European citizens about the rising importance of AI in their lives, amid reports from China of facial-recognition technology used to crack down on dissent. “I find it truly really scary what I saw in Hong Kong,” said the EU Commission’s executive vice-president on digital policy, Margrethe Vestager, who will spearhead the policy.  During a wave of anti-Beijing protests, she said, “People could get a message on the phone: ‘We know you’re there, maybe you should go home’. Not really supportive of the freedom to assemble, or to express yourself.” Megvii denies its facial recognition can identify you with a mask on 12 Feb 2020 Megvii denies its facial recognition can identify you with a mask on 12 Feb 2020 But instead of an outright ban or moratorium, which would require member state backing, Vestager told reporters in Brussels she would recommend that authorities and companies use caution. “What we will say in the paper in a very lawyered up language is, let’s pause and figure out if there are any … circumstances where facial recognition remotely should be authorised,” she told reporters.  “Because if we do not pause, then it will … just be everywhere,” she warned comparing it to the sudden rise of CCTV security in city centres.   Describing the spread of cameras, she said: “First you put up one, but then it has a blind angle and then you put up the other one … All of a sudden you have cameras everywhere.”  Caution is also needed because the uses of facial recognition are wide-ranging – from unlocking smartphones to capturing criminals – and often inaccurate and in need of development. The former Danish finance minister, who is also in charge of enforcing EU competition rules, underlined that AI was a vast subject and that any regulation should be mindful of not punishing smaller innovators, which would only benefit major players. Big tech firms familiar to everyday users – such as Facebook or Tencent – are mainly from the United States or China. Europe meanwhile is seen as a leader on regulation, notably with rules on data privacy that have been widely replicated elsewhere.   But with AI, Vestager said Europe wanted to be a player and not just a sheriff. And if Europe is to develop tech giants, it will probably be in business services and network infrastructure, and not mass market sites or social media. “If you want to have a say about things that we consider risky then you should be able to do it yourself,” she said. Europe wants to be “sovereign” on AI and protect “the integrity of our grids, of our infrastructure of our research,” she said. But this was not against anyone, she insisted, amid talk of a high tech cold war between the US and China with Europe caught in the middle. “It’s about us, what we would like to be able to do.” Other proposals on Wednesday will include a push to make data centres more energy-efficient and be carbon neutral by 2030. The EU will also offer a voluntary labelling scheme for companies that abide by EU rules and values on AI. “We don’t want to regulate anything that starts with A and ends with an I. That doesn’t make any sense,” Vestager said. “But where there is risk, it will be for real.” 	SCMP

The demonstrations took place as authorities scrambled to bring back some 2,000 Hongkongers stranded in Hubei province, the epicentre of the Covid-19 crisis, as well as 330 residents on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. Passengers have been stuck on the vessel for 11 days, with the number of infections rising. Hong Kong coronavirus protest: Disruption near quarantine sites close to residential areas Hong Kong coronavirus protest: Disruption near quarantine sites close to residential areas Protesters in Kwai Chung, Cheung Sha Wan, Sai Kung, Fo Tan and Kowloon Bay said on Sunday they understood the need for the extra facilities as the number of suspected and confirmed infections in the city continued to rise. But they argued that these should be in areas far from residential estates. As of Sunday evening, Hong Kong had recorded 57 confirmed Covid-19 cases, including one related fatality. 57 confirmed Covid-19 cases  In Kwai Chung, hundreds of protesters marched in the morning from a school to the South Kwai Chung Jockey Club General Outpatient Clinic, designated as a facility to treat patients with mild fever and respiratory illnesses. Participant Ada Chan, who has lived on the Kwai Luen Estate near the clinic for eight years, said she was worried about the potential health risk, with her neighbourhood just a stone’s throw from the clinic. “It’s just a street away. There’re also many secondary and primary school students in the area,” the 40-year-old said.  “There are plenty of places elsewhere, why can’t the government find another site?”  During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic of 2003, which killed 299 people in the city, the same clinic was also designated for similar uses – to screen close contacts of infected patients. But protester Wing Chan, another resident, said the situation now was different from Sars as her estate was not built until 2011.   Democratic Party lawmaker Andrew Wan Siu-kin, who co-organised the march, said it was an “extremely inappropriate decision” to set up the clinic there, because there were 100,000 residents living nearby. “Is the government out of its mind?” he said. Kwai Tsing district councillor Ng Kim-sing said the government should instead consider setting up a temporary clinic at the site of the abandoned Kwai Chung Public School. In Cheung Sha Wan, angry groups lashed out against the plan to turn the Cheung Sha Wan Jockey Club General Outpatient Clinic into a designated centre. Some waved flags supporting Hong Kong independence, while others held the American flag. Participants chanted slogans from the months-long anti-government movement, such as “Liberate Hong Kong; Revolution of our times”. Sham Shui Po District Council member Kalvin Ho Kai-ming slammed the government for not consulting residents. Meanwhile, in Sai Kung, dozens gathered at the Waterfront Park to protest against the Sai Kung Outdoor Recreation Centre being used as a quarantine centre. Over at Fo Tan, more than 100 people braved the rain to rally at San Mei Street Playground, decrying the government’s plan to use the newly built and unoccupied Chun Yeung Estate as a quarantine centre. Hongkongers who lived through Sars outbreak call for more government action against new coronavirus Hongkongers who lived through Sars outbreak call for more government action against new coronavirus Speaking at the rally, Civic Party lawmaker Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu said it was unacceptable for the government to only offer a special allowance of HK$6,000 to each household for the delay in letting them move in. At about 9pm, about 100 protesters launched another march from Richland Gardens to nearby Kai Yip Estate in Kowloon Bay against the proposal to turn Kowloon Bay Health Centre into a designated clinic for screening Covid-19 infections. At about 10.40pm, riot police broke up a clash between protesters and a male resident of Richland Gardens. Officers used pepper spray against reporters, ordering them to back away from the scuffle. A blue flag, warning of an illegal assembly, was raised. Executive councillor Lam Ching-choi assured residents on Sunday that those living near potential quarantine sites faced no risk of infection. “When patients need to be referred to hospitals for further check-ups, they will be sent by coaches directly from the quarantine centres. There will be no contact with the community,” he said. “If people opposed [all quarantine sites], those stranded in Japan or Wuhan would not be able to return to Hong Kong.”   With no announcements made so far on how authorities planned to evacuate those stranded in Hubei province, pro-Beijing party the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong said it met representatives of the central government’s liaison office in the city on Friday to convey residents’ wishes to return home. The party, in a statement, quoted the office as saying that they helped the Hong Kong government deliver five batches of drugs for emergency use and medical protective gear to 88 stranded Hong Kong people.

The virus causes a deadly disease known as Covid-19. Vivian Cheung Kar-fay, executive director of operations at the authority, said: “The airport’s traffic has been affected by multiple factors, including the novel coronavirus outbreak in late January and social circumstances.”   In January, 5.7 million passengers passed through the airport, down 11.7 per cent year on year, while the amount of air cargo handled fell by 10.4 per cent, amid the closure of mainland Chinese factories for the Lunar New Year. The airport handled around 60 per cent fewer passenger flights this weekend. The gap will widen as more airlines, including Cathay Pacific, will reduce flights further from next week.  On Saturday, 231 flights were scheduled to take off from Hong Kong with 64 cancelled. On Sunday, some 217 flights were set to depart with 40 cancelled. Among the latest adjustments, Air Canada said Toronto-Hong Kong flights would be suspended for most of next month, while Lufthansa and Swiss also reduced flights to Hong Kong. Experts said the airport, which had been amid a prolonged slump in air traffic because of the anti-government protests, was likely to face a slower recovery than during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003. Traveller numbers at airport in biggest drop since 2009 as protests batter tourism 20 Jan 2020 Traveller numbers at airport in biggest drop since 2009 as protests batter tourism 20 Jan 2020 Last week, American and United Airlines once again pushed back the date to resume flights to mainland China and Hong Kong to late April from late March, marking a near three-month hiatus from serving the city airport.  British Airways and Finnair, meanwhile, suspended one of two daily flights each to Hong Kong, with the UK flag carrier set to reinstate its full schedule in May. Both airlines’ mainland China flights remained suspended through March.  During the worst month of the Sars crisis, passenger traffic fell by 70 per cent, but air traffic rebounded strongly in the following year.   Struggling hometown rival Hong Kong Airlines, which cut 400 jobs in a last-ditch effort to stay afloat, warned a fortnight ago that weak travel demand would “likely continue” into the summer season – lasting from late March until late October. Later this week, Cathay Pacific will unveil its January performance and its monthly commentary will offer clues about the airline’s future prospects. Ivan Su, an analyst at Morningstar, said: “The effect of the protests will have a more prolonged impact on travel demand than the coronavirus outbreak. It will take much longer to see Chinese tourist arrival numbers climb back to 2018 levels.” Tourist arrival numbers go into free fall amid restrictions to tackle outbreak 15 Feb 2020 Tourist arrival numbers go into free fall amid restrictions to tackle outbreak 15 Feb 2020 Some 51 million mainland visitors came to Hong Kong in 2018, but the figures fell by 14.2 per cent last year. As the citywide protests escalated, the monthly numbers fell by half. The new rule of 14 days’ mandatory quarantine for anyone coming from the mainland to curb the outbreak has further discouraged people from visiting Hong Kong. The UN’s global aviation body earlier this week said the impact of the coronavirus on air travel was about to be worse than during the Sars, citing “the higher volume and greater global extent of the flight cancellations”.   As air travel to mainland China has grown exponentially, a study by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) said the higher starting point meant there was further to fall. Airlines are likely to be deprived of US$4-5 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2020, the organisation said. It said up to 20 million fewer people were travelling amid the outbreak. A total of 70 airlines have cancelled all international flights to and from mainland China while a further 50 reduced operations, amounting to an 80 per cent cut in non-domestic services. Aviation data firm Cirium showed a fifth of domestic China flights were flying by February 11. Henk Ombelet, head of advisory operations at Ascend by Cirium, said more cuts to flights was “dependent upon the further evolution of the virus transmission and infection rates in China and further afield”. With two-thirds of outbound Chinese travellers typically opting to travel in the Asia-Pacific, ForwardKeys data shows advanced bookings in March and April was set to fall by 58 per cent. 	SCMP

Chan, who is expected to deliver the budget later this month, sounded the warning on his official blog on Sunday. “It is likely that the budget deficit for the new financial year [2020-21] will be the biggest ever,” Chan wrote, not specifying how large it could be. He attributed it partly to the need to launch countercyclical measures to boost the economy and partly to the increase in the government’s recurrent expenditure in recent years. He said the impact of the outbreak on the city’s economy would probably be bigger than that during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak of 2003.  “The impact is not only felt in the retail, catering, or tourism-related sectors. Such a tsunami-scale blow could cause the unemployment rate to deteriorate rapidly,” he wrote. Hong Kong’s biggest deficit so far was about HK$63.3 billion (US$8 billion) in 2001-02. That was followed by a deficit of HK$61.7 billion in 2002-03 and HK$40.1 billion in 2003-04. The city reported a surplus of HK$21.4 billion in 2004-05.   The government’s total expenditure grew by 174 per cent from 1997-98 to 2018-19, compared with a 113 per cent growth in total revenue.  Between 2014-15 and 2018-19, the city’s recurrent expenditure grew by 32 per cent from HK$305.1 billion to HK$403 billion. Recurrent spending on social welfare saw the biggest jump, growing by 46.4 per cent during this period, according to official data.  Last month, Chan warned that the deficit for the current financial year could be as much as 3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), at about HK$80 billion. Financial secretary warns of job losses from coronavirus outbreak 9 Feb 2020 Financial secretary warns of job losses from coronavirus outbreak 9 Feb 2020 But on his blog on Sunday, Chan downplayed the significance of going into the red, noting that the city was backed by reserves of HK$1.1 trillion. “The government’s current fiscal reserves allow it to launch countercyclical measures in the near future to stabilise employment and support the economy,” Chan wrote. “But, to ensure the stability of the public finances, we have to pay more attention to fiscal sustainability as well as keeping expenditure within the limits of revenues, when we consider new expenditure, especially recurrent expenditure.” The city government announced last Friday it would offer a HK$25 billion relief package to ease the impact of the outbreak on people’s livelihoods and the business sector. The package included handouts for businesses in the hard-hit catering, retail and tourism sectors, as well as allowances for poor families and students. Hong Kong’s economy shrank by 2.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2019, in the second consecutive quarter of contraction. For the whole of 2019, GDP was expected to shrink by 1.2 per cent in real terms, the first annual decline since 2009. in the second consecutive quarter of contraction Hong Kong sits on huge reserves. And during economic downturns, it is right for the government to boost spending to support the economy Terence Chong, Chinese University Professor Terence Chong Tai-leung, executive director of Chinese University’s Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, said there was no need to worry too much about a possible “record deficit”. “Hong Kong sits on huge reserves. And during economic downturns, it is right for the government to boost spending to support the economy,” Chong said. “While the Basic Law asks us to achieve a fiscal balance, having a deficit for a couple of years is not the end of the world. It should not be a problem if we can achieve a fiscal balance in a longer run of five years or so.”   The city’s mini-constitution states that the government should strive to achieve a fiscal balance by following “the principle of keeping expenditure within the limits of revenues in drawing up its budget”. Dr Billy Mak Sui-choi of Baptist University’s school of business echoed Chong’s views. “Hong Kong has a lot of fiscal reserves, which can keep the city afloat for several years even if the government has zero revenue,” he said. “But a huge deficit could affect Hong Kong’s credit rating in the short term, while also giving a bad impression to the international community.” 	SCMP

That would have been hard to imagine until about two weeks ago, when scores of people began flocking to a family farm in the New Territories town of Fanling. “We have a lot of people here waiting, so please do not rush, we hope everyone is able to buy the vegetables they want today,” Becky Au Hei-man, 34, a third-generation farmer, told the queue of three dozen customers that snaked around Mapopo Community Farm last Sunday. Driven by escalating fears amid the coronavirus outbreak, which as of Saturday had infected 56 Hongkongers, panic-stricken residents have taken to emptying shelves of rice and toilet paper in major supermarkets. coronavirus outbreak Fresh vegetables, meanwhile, though largely still available, have soared in price. As fears around the virus first grew following the Lunar New Year holiday, produce prices jumped anywhere from 30 to 100 per cent, according to the government-backed Vegetable Marketing Organisation (VMO).  But while prices came down as the initial panic subsided, they remain higher than in the first two weeks of January due to ongoing mark-ups on mainland Chinese produce, which accounts for the bulk of the city’s needs. Enter Hong Kong’s local farms, which remain unaffected by the fluctuations.  The sudden price competitiveness has brought a surge of new customers for local produce, which currently accounts for less than 1.7 per cent of the city’s supply, according to figures from 2017 by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department. One-month rice reserves enough for Hong Kong to meet demand during outbreak, importer says One-month rice reserves enough for Hong Kong to meet demand during outbreak, importer says Locally grown vegetables have historically sold for 20 to 30 per cent more than mainland produce, and what local produce is available has typically been sold to wholesalers through the VMO, with very little going directly from farm to consumer.  “Local farm products are always more expensive and less convenient to buy, so I did not think of buying it before. But now, even vegetables from the mainland are expensive, so that makes local vegetables more appealing,” said Tiff Cheung, who arrived with her husband and three-year-old daughter 30 minutes before the twice-weekly farmers’ market opened. Local farm products are always more expensive and less convenient to buy, so I did not think of buying it before. But now, even vegetables from the mainland are expensive Tiff Cheung, a shopper at Mapopo Community Market Ms Ma, a regular customer who lives in Ho Man Tin and travels an hour to Mapopo farm to buy vegetables every Sunday, said she has taken to arriving 45 minutes before the market opens because of all the new faces. “If I do not come early, I will be left with very little to choose from,” she said. With new and old customers thinking alike, revenue at the farmers’ market, held each Wednesday and Sunday right next to the farm, doubled from HK$7,000 to HK$16,000 last weekend. “Usually the week following the end of the Lunar New Year is a slow season for the farming industry. It was so shocking, because we were not expecting this at all,” said Au, who runs the farm. Hong Kong protest supporters hold independent Lunar New Year fairs across the city Hong Kong protest supporters hold independent Lunar New Year fairs across the city She said it was the most popular her produce had been since the farm was founded 10 years ago. “Last week, we even had to harvest vegetables during the market, because we did not have enough stock for customers to buy,” she said. “We did not increase the price for our vegetables, because our cost did not change so we won’t raise the price just because there is a larger demand,” Au added. Just an hour after their farmers’ market opened on Sunday, two-thirds of their produce was sold. “The popularity is surreal to us. We have tried hard to promote sustainable local farming and the importance for Hong Kong to have its own agricultural supply, and suddenly it seems like people have all caught up and realised how important these issues we have been talking about all along are,” Au said. Au, who lives with her parents at their farm in Ma Shi Po village, founded Mapopo Community Farm in 2009 to practise sustainable farming along the fringes of Hong Kong’s urban sprawl. However, instead of a peaceful farming life, the family ended up in a decade-long struggle with their landowner – property giant Henderson Land Development. Henderson Land Development The company, which plans to build residential housing there under the government’s New Territories redevelopment plan, ceased all rental agreements with the villagers, including Au, in 2007. plans to build residential housing there Since then, about 40 households of villagers have ignored repeated eviction orders and continued to occupy the site. The farmland is set to be cleared by the third quarter of this year. New town plan ‘killing family farms through failing relocation proposals’ 22 Jan 2019 New town plan ‘killing family farms through failing relocation proposals’ 22 Jan 2019 The Au family, while making last-ditch efforts to bargain with the government, have continued to produce organic vegetables, recycle food waste from surrounding communities, organise farmers’ markets and conduct guided tours to promote their cause to the wider public. By doing so, they hope to advocate agricultural policies that would make better use of Hong Kong’s farmland. While farmland accounts for 4.5 per cent of the city’s total land area, more than 84 per cent of it lies fallow, according to figures from the Planning Department and the AFCD.   Apart from their efforts to rally public support for local farming over the years, the family has seen interest in their work boom amid eight months of anti-government protests, which have seen a rise in localism among those who reject further economic integration with and reliance on the mainland. Mapopo Community Farm was one of the local businesses to benefit from the protest movement’s push to support “yellow”, or pro-democracy, businesses. The so-called yellow economic circle has pushed for consumers to patronise businesses like Mapopo, which openly advertise their sympathy with protesters, and boycott those seen as “blue”, or pro-government. The movement has drawn condemnation from some who say it is needlessly divisive and unfair to make small business publicly choose sides. unfair to make small business publicly choose sides But the concept resonated with Ms Chow, 30, who is among those who made the switch for political reasons. “I was very determined to stop buying mainland vegetables and switch to buying from Mapopo,” Chow, who started visiting the farm in January, said as she queued last Sunday to buy vegetables for her family of three. “The decision was largely inspired by the political movement. I reconsidered how money should be spent. I realised the vegetables here really taste fresher than the imported ones we usually buy in the market, and I believe that our family is eating better-quality food, as I am confident in Hong Kong farmers,” said Chow, who travelled 30 minutes from her home in Tai Po to get to the farm.   While the surge of customers in recent weeks has been a win for Hong Kong’s local farmers, Au’s mother, 63-year-old Law Shui-shum, is pessimistic about their prospects in the long run. “Hongkongers are very forgetful. After these times, when prices and supply of vegetables in the market go back to normal, I don’t think there will be such an interest in our products any more,” she said, adding that they had no plans to increase their sowing schedule because of the sudden surge. Looming over everything is the eviction the Aus and their neighbouring farmers face in the latter half of the year, which could drive the final nail into the farm’s coffin. The farmers say they have been offered a few options, including relocation to more remote government-owned land, or taking compensation and giving up farming entirely. The process of negotiation has been delayed by the government’s work-from-home policy during the coronavirus outbreak, buying some time for the farmers. And as long as they have time, they have hope, Au said. “We have no choice but to remain hopeful; to have the hope that this virus will make people see the importance of Hong Kong being self-sufficient.”  For weeks, the graph charting new cases of Covid-19 in South Korea rose in a steep line – a literal illustration of the rapid, seemingly unstoppable spread of the coronavirus. Then the line began to curve. or weeks, the Covid-19 in South Korea seemingly unstoppable spread of the coronavirus After announcing 600 new cases for March 3, the authorities reported 131 new infections a week later. On Friday, officials reported just 110, the lowest daily toll since February 21. The same day, the number of recovered patients, 177, exceeded new infections for the first time. President Moon Jae-in, while cautioning against premature optimism, has expressed hope that South Korea could soon enter a “phase of stability” if the trend holds firm. President Moon Jae-in South Korea With about 8,000 confirmed cases and more than 65 deaths, it was until recently the country with the most confirmed cases outside China – but South Korea has since emerged as a source of inspiration and hope for authorities around the world as they scramble to fight the pandemic. South Korea’s infection rate falls without citywide lockdowns like China, Italy 11 Mar 2020 South Korea’s infection rate falls without citywide lockdowns like China, Italy 11 Mar 2020 As countries ranging from the United States to Italy and Iran struggle to manage the virus, Seoul’s handling of the outbreak – involving a highly coordinated government response that has emphasised transparency and relied heavily on public cooperation in place of hardline measures such as lockdowns – is increasingly viewed by public health experts as a model to emulate for authorities desperate to keep the virus under control. Whereas China, where the virus originated, and more recently Italy have placed millions of their citizens on lockdown, South Korea has not restricted people’s movements – not even in Daegu, the southeastern city at the centre of the country’s outbreak. Instead, authorities have focused mandatory quarantine on infected patients and those with whom they have come into close contact, while advising the public to stay indoors, avoid public events, wear masks and practise good hygiene. And while numerous countries have imposed sweeping travel bans – including the US, which has introduced dramatic restrictions on travel from Europe – Seoul has instead introduced “special immigration procedures” for heavily affected countries such as China, requiring travellers to undergo temperature checks, provide verified contact information and fill out health questionnaires. [South Korea’s] approach seems less dramatic and more usable by other countries, compared with that used in mainland China Ian MacKay, virologist at the University of Queensland “More than a week of downward-trending case counts shows that the approach in South Korea has turned around an epidemic,” said Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland, Australia. “This approach seems less dramatic and more usable by other countries, compared with that used in mainland China. If these trends continue, they will have managed to stop the growth of their epidemic.”   ‘A SPECTACULAR FEAT’ ‘A SPECTACULAR FEAT’ The linchpin of South Korea’s response has been a testing programme that has screened more people per capita for the virus than any other country by far. By carrying out up to 15,000 tests per day, health officials have been able to screen some 250,000 people – about one in every 200 South Koreans – since January. To encourage participation, testing is free for anyone referred by a doctor or displaying symptoms after recent contact with a confirmed case or travel to China. For anyone simply concerned about the risk of infection, the cost is a relatively affordable 160,000 won (US$135). Testing is available at hundreds of clinics, as well as some 50 drive-through testing stations that took their inspiration from past counterterrorism drills and can screen suspected patients in minutes.  “This country has a universal health-coverage system for the whole population and the economic burden for testing is very low,” said Kim Dong-hyun, president of the Korean Society of Epidemiology. “Tests are conducted for free if you have proper symptoms.”    The massive volume of data collected has enabled the authorities to pinpoint clusters of infection to better target their quarantine and disinfection efforts, and send members of the public text-message alerts to inform them of the past movements of infected patients in their area – even down to the names of shops and restaurants they visited. This country has a universal health coverage system for the whole population and the economic burden for testing is very low Kim Dong-hyun, president of the Korean Society of Epidemiology “South Korea’s capability to test for early detection of viruses has developed greatly as it went through the 2009 new influenza outbreak and 2015 Mers [Middle East respiratory syndrome] outbreak,” said Kim Woo-joo, a professor of medicine at Korea University’s College of Medicine. “It ranks among the world’s top countries in this field.” South Korea's 'drive-through' coronavirus testing stations South Korea's 'drive-through' coronavirus testing stations Collecting this amount of data has also allowed the South Korean authorities to glean a clearer indication of the potential lethality of the virus, the fatality rate of which has diverged significantly from about 5 per cent in Italy to about 0.8 per cent in South Korea. Although factors including quality of health care, patient age and public awareness can affect the fatality rate of a virus, the scale of testing is among the most influential.  By comparison, in neighbouring Japan – which has confirmed more than 600 cases, not including the virus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship – the authorities had as of Friday tested over 10,000 people. In the United States, where the authorities are unable to confirm the number of tests since they are being carried out by a patchwork of federal, state and private laboratories, the total was estimated to be fewer than 5,000 in a survey of available data by The Atlantic. The Atlantic William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in the US, said South Korea had pulled off a “spectacular” feat that was allowing health officials to track the virus and assess its intensity. “We are unsure where our infection is and how intensely it is being transmitted in the US and we are only now starting to test,” he said. Coronavirus is now classified as a pandemic 13 Mar 2020 Coronavirus is now classified as a pandemic 13 Mar 2020 South Korea is not unique in claiming some success in its fight against the virus. Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, informed by past outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Mers, have managed to keep confirmed cases low while eschewing the sort of draconian measures implemented in mainland China. Early on, Hong Kong took some of the most comprehensive steps to implement “social distancing” – in which events are cancelled and venues closed to minimise contact between people – by shutting schools in late January, while the authorities produced a digital map of confirmed cases to allow people to avoid potentially infected areas. In Taiwan, officials have pooled information from immigration and health insurance databases to track people’s travel histories and symptoms, and used phone tracking to ensure compliance with quarantine. Singapore has similarly tracked infected patients and traced their contacts, with stiff penalties for those who disobey quarantine or mislead the authorities about where they have travelled. OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY But where South Korea has stood apart is seemingly turning the tide against a major outbreak while maintaining openness and transparency. The largest cluster of cases in the country is linked to a secretive religious sect, Shincheonji, members of which have been accused of negligently spreading the virus as well as evading medical follow-ups and testing. In addressing the Covid-19 outbreak, sound decision-making should not be about making a choice between maximised protection or minimal disruption Yanzhong Huang, Council on Foreign Relations “South Korea’s experience suggests that a country can contain the spread of the virus in a relatively short period of time without relying on draconian, at-all-costs containment measures,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “For countries like the US, the Korean experience offers an acceptable, likely more viable, alternative to addressing the outbreak. In addressing the Covid-19 outbreak, sound decision-making should not be about making a choice between maximised protection and minimal disruption.” China effectively barred 60 million people in Wuhan – ground zero of the outbreak – and the rest of the province of Hubei from leaving their homes, while restricting the movements of hundreds of millions of others across the country by shutting down public transport, banning private cars and setting up roadblocks. ‘I was stupidly overconfident’: a Korean coronavirus survivor’s tale 15 Mar 2020 ‘I was stupidly overconfident’: a Korean coronavirus survivor’s tale 15 Mar 2020 The country claims to have effectively halted the spread of the virus after recording more than 80,000 cases and 3,100 deaths, and its daily updates have in recent weeks fallen from thousands of new cases to dozens. However, scepticism lingers over official figures after local and provincial officials in Hubei initially tried to hide the extent of the outbreak. In a move widely seen to be aimed at touting the success of Beijing’s hardline measures, Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday made his first visit to Wuhan, during which he called for businesses and factories to return to work as normal and for the country to refocus on economic growth. President Xi Jinping “While China has been able to control Covid-19, I don’t think its draconian methods are worth copying in liberal democracies,” said Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University Law Centre in Washington. “Most democracies value human rights and freedoms … [not] the degree of social control we’ve seen in China. South Korea offers a better model.” But in a striking indication that Beijing’s harsh tactics could inform even liberal democratic societies, Italy on Monday announced a nationwide quarantine after a massive spike in cases caught the authorities off guard. Shops, restaurants and bars have been closed, while public gatherings and most travel have been banned in the European country, which has confirmed more than 15,000 cases and 1,000 deaths as of Friday – making it the site of the biggest outbreak outside China. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday announced a lockdown of the entire Metro Manila region and its 12.8 million people. David Hui Shu-cheong, an expert in respiratory medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said Italy had responded “very slowly” to the outbreak, in contrast to South Korea. Southeast Asia at risk of missing coronavirus cases amid dengue outbreak: experts 11 Mar 2020 Southeast Asia at risk of missing coronavirus cases amid dengue outbreak: experts 11 Mar 2020 Even as Beijing touted its success at fighting the virus, with state media recently insisting the “world owes China a ‘thank you’”, South Korea – which democratised in the late 1980s following decades of military dictatorship – has made no secret of its desire to promote a more liberal alternative. At a press conference with foreign media this week, vice-health minister Kim Gang-lip said that while drastic measures such as locking down affected areas had demonstrated “modest effectiveness”, they suffered from being “coercive and inflexible”. “Korea, as a democratic country, values globalisation and a pluralistic society,” he said. “Therefore we believe we must transcend the limitations of the conventional approach to fighting infectious disease.” Kim stressed that public trust was crucial to the government’s strategy. “The more transparently and quickly accurate information is provided, the more the people will trust the government,” he said. “They will act rationally for the good of the community at large.” UNKNOWN FACTORS UNKNOWN FACTORS Although the authorities have shut down schools nationwide, South Koreans have largely embraced self-isolation and social distancing of their own accord. In the past fortnight, more than 12,000 businesses have applied for subsidies to pay the wages of employees while they temporarily close their doors due to the outbreak, according to the country’s labour ministry. Many shops in Daegu, the site of more than three-quarters of the country’s cases, have shut their doors, while shopping malls and cinemas across the country have become largely deserted as people stay at home. Catholic churches and Buddhist temples nationwide have suspended mass and prayer services. “To an outsider, South Korea has handled an enormous surge in cases very well and seemed to mitigate further spread through forms of … passive social isolation,” said Howard P. Forman, a professor of public health policy at Yale School of Management. Indonesian firms doing business with China face tough times with coronavirus outbreak 12 Mar 2020 Indonesian firms doing business with China face tough times with coronavirus outbreak 12 Mar 2020 Some experts suggest South Korean society’s emphasis on discipline and community may have given it room to avoid implementing more draconian measures. “This measure appears to have been very successful but is reliant on the local population working with the response,” said Jeremy Rossman, an honorary senior lecturer in virology at the University of Kent. “It is not clear how effective this approach would be in other cultures and it does require effective communication with the local population.” How a secretive church in South Korea became a coronavirus ‘super spreader’ How a secretive church in South Korea became a coronavirus ‘super spreader’ However, South Korea’s response has not been without missteps or critics. In mid-February, before it emerged that the virus had spread rapidly among Shincheonji followers, Moon made the ill-fated prediction that the outbreak would “disappear before long”. The Korean Medical Association – the country’s largest association of doctors – and conservative media have criticised the president for not outright banning travel from China. Nearly 1.5 million South Koreans have signed an online petition calling for Moon’s impeachment over his handling of the outbreak, and his approval rating this week dropped to just under 45 per cent – although, in a sign of reviving fortunes, an opinion poll released on Friday saw the president’s response rated favourably. It is still too early to say whether the response is working Kim Dong-hyun, president of the Korean Society of Epidemiology Some experts caution that it is too early to tell if South Korea truly has the virus under control. The discovery of a new cluster of about 100 infections at a call centre in densely populated Seoul prompted a sudden uptick in cases on Wednesday, raising fears the virus could be on the verge of spreading uncontrollably nationwide. “It is still too early to say whether the response is working,” said Kim, the president of the Korean Society of Epidemiology. “There is an optical illusion involved in the figures. The daily numbers of new cases appear to be decreasing as the screening of Shincheonji followers is coming to an end, but it must be noted that there are new clusters emerging in Seoul and other areas. We can’t lower vigilance.” Like elsewhere, the country is facing unknown factors such as warming temperatures in the coming weeks and the arrival of travellers from new and emerging infection hotspots overseas. “We are seeing that in South Korea, large epidemics can be slowed,” said Mackay from the University of Queensland. “Can they be prevented? That will be the challenge for countries who have yet to see widespread community transmission.” In the face of uncertainty, South Korea appears determined to hold firm to its strategy. During a visit to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday, Moon said the country’s response had received international recognition and allowed it to avoid the “extreme choice” of sweeping travel bans. The next day, responding to the World Health Organisation’s decision to declare the virus a global pandemic, the president called on South Koreans to maintain hope that the virus would be overcome. World Health Organisation “It might take more time than we thought,” Moon said. “Everyone, please don’t become fatigued.” ■ ■ ■ Additional reporting by Park Chan-kyong Additional reporting by Park Chan-kyong      Park Hyun, a 48-year-old university professor, took pains to ensure his health. He went to the gym five days a week and maintained his personal hygiene, washing his hands all the time and “overusing” hand sanitiser – but that didn’t stop him from being infected with the coronavirus. ark Hyun, a the coronavirus Park, who has since recovered, turned to Facebook to share his experience “to help my friends and loved ones to ward off the highly contagious virus”. South Korea has reported more than 8,000 cases of the virus, along with 72 deaths. South Korea has reported more than 8,000 cases of the virus “We must be cautious! But no panic and no fear,” Park wrote in a Facebook post on March 8. “I was naive and stupid to think that [the outbreak] is not my problem. Yes, as usual, I was stupidly overconfident.” I was naive and stupid to think that [the outbreak] is not my problem Park Hyun Busan City, where he lives, reported its first confirmed case of the coronavirus on February 21. The same day, Park said he felt a “very mild sore throat and very mild dry coughing”. Over the next two days, he felt mild but growing pressure on the chest and decided to stay home and skip his daily gym visit, “not because of feeling bad but due to coronavirus patients being reported near my place”.   On February 24, he had breathing problems early in the morning, which Park said scared him as the Oncheon Church – where a cluster of patients was reported in Busan – is in his neighbourhood. He frantically started placing calls to the health authorities, who first said he did not need to take a coronavirus test as there were long queues at test centres and there was a high risk of catching the virus. Also, his case did not appear so severe. South Korea’s virus response is the opposite of China’s – and it works 15 Mar 2020 South Korea’s virus response is the opposite of China’s – and it works 15 Mar 2020 However, Park’s symptoms worsened, and on his third call the authorities told him to go to a nearby hospital to take a test. Though it was early in the morning, there was already a very long queue outside the hospital’s test centre, where he was told he would have to wait in line for four hours.  “After about 30 minutes waiting in a queue, I had dyspnea [shortness of breath] again and collapsed, hitting my head on the floor,” Park wrote. He was treated for a head injury and tested for the coronavirus. He then quarantined himself at home, and the following day received a text message confirming he had tested positive.  Park was told to stay home for another 24 hours before being admitted to a hospital for treatment, but a health official then called him to trace his movements and close contacts. Explainer: Coronavirus is now classified as a pandemic 13 Mar 2020 Explainer: Coronavirus is now classified as a pandemic 13 Mar 2020 During the conversation, she realised the severity of his condition, prompting her to move Park up the queue for treatment. Close to midnight, he was warded in a negative-pressure room in the quarantine section of Kosin University Gospel Hospital’s intensive care unit. There, he underwent a CAT scan and several other tests before he was medicated and hooked up to an oxygen tank. Park said he was breathing a bit easier by February 26, but his chest pain was still severe. “I felt a burning pain in my chest and stomach, although I was not sure if it was because of the drugs I took or the virus,” he wrote. “I had a slight fever and my condition fluctuated. At first I felt as if some heavy iron plate … was pressing on my chest. The stabbing pain gradually eased to the point it felt as if someone was squeezing my chest hard. “I sometimes felt very hungry … I knew I had to eat to survive but it was very difficult to swallow due to my difficulty breathing.” He was discharged nine days after being admitted, and is now in quarantine for 14 days as he recovers. Park said all the people he was in contact with the week before he was admitted to hospital, including his mother and sister, have tested negative for the virus. He expressed thanks to the medical staff who looked after him “as if they were my family members” and “did their best to avoid causing any unnecessary pain while treating patients with injections, bringing meals to them and even cleaning their room”. ■ ■ ■  The first case of someone in China suffering from Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, can be traced back to November 17, according to government data seen by the South China Morning Post. Covid-19 coronavirus South China Morning Post Chinese authorities have so far identified at least 266 people who were infected last year, all of whom came under medical surveillance at some point. Some of the cases were likely backdated after health authorities had tested specimens taken from suspected patients. Interviews with whistle-blowers from the medical community suggest Chinese doctors only realised they were dealing with a new disease in late December.   Scientists have been trying to map the pattern of the early transmission of Covid-19 since an epidemic was reported in the central China city of Wuhan in January, two months before the outbreak became a global health crisis. Understanding how the disease spread and determining how undetected and undocumented cases contributed to its transmission will greatly improve their understanding of the size of that threat. According to the government data seen by the Post, a 55 year-old from Hubei province could have been the first person to have contracted Covid-19 on November 17. Post From that date onwards, one to five new cases were reported each day. By December 15, the total number of infections stood at 27 – the first double-digit daily rise was reported on December 17 – and by December 20, the total number of confirmed cases had reached 60.   On December 27, Zhang Jixian, a doctor from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, told China’s health authorities that the disease was caused by a new coronavirus. By that date, more than 180 people had been infected, though doctors might not have been aware of all of them at the time. With pandemic declared, the race is on to develop a coronavirus vaccine 13 Mar 2020 With pandemic declared, the race is on to develop a coronavirus vaccine 13 Mar 2020 By the final day of 2019, the number of confirmed cases had risen to 266, On the first day of 2020 it stood at 381.  While the government records have not been released to the public, they provide valuable clues about how the disease spread in its early days and the speed of its transmission, as well as how many confirmed cases Beijing has recorded.   Scientists are now keen to identify the so-called patient zero, which could help them to trace the source of the coronavirus, which is generally thought to have jumped to humans from a wild animal, possibly a bat.  Of the first nine cases to be reported in November – four men and five women – none has been confirmed as being “patient zero”. They were all aged between 39 and 79, but it is unknown how many were residents of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei and the epicentre of the outbreak.   It is possible that there were reported cases dating back even earlier than those seen by the Post. Post According to the World Health Organisation’s website, the first confirmed Covid-19 case in China was on December 8, but the global body does not track the disease itself but relies on nations to provide such information. World Health Organisation A report published in medical journal The Lancet by Chinese doctors from Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, which treated some of the earliest patients, put the date of the first known infection at December 1. The Lancet Dr Ai Fen, the first known whistle-blower, told People magazine in an interview that was later censored, that tests showed that a patient at Wuhan Central Hospital was diagnosed on December 16 as having contracted an unknown coronavirus. People With pandemic declared, the race is on to develop a coronavirus vaccine 13 Mar 2020 With pandemic declared, the race is on to develop a coronavirus vaccine 13 Mar 2020 Accounts by other doctors seem to suggest the medical community in Wuhan became aware of the disease in late December. Previous reports said that although doctors in the city collected samples from suspected cases in late December, they could not confirm their findings because they were bogged down by bureaucracy, such as having to get approval from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, which could take days. They were also ordered not to disclose any information about the new disease to the public. As late as January 11, Wuhan’s health authorities were still claiming there were just 41 confirmed cases.

Demonstrators set fire to a card machine and threw rubbish bins onto the tracks at Tin Sau Light Rail station, in the northern town of Tin Shui Wai, while police responded by pepper spraying those involved and detained at least 20 people. Protesters took to the streets in three districts, with small groups in Kennedy Town and Tai Po demonstrating against clinics in those areas being assigned to treat suspected cases of the virus, which causes the disease officially known as Covid-19. Hong Kong coronavirus protest: Disruption near quarantine sites close to residential areas Hong Kong coronavirus protest: Disruption near quarantine sites close to residential areas Although there were no arrests in Tai Po, the Hospital Authority claimed the Tai Po Jockey Club General Out-patient clinic, one of the 18 designated clinics on the list, had been vandalised. It condemned the action and said it had reported it to the police. Police said they received a report from a security guard at the clinic at 9.30am, and discovered some broken glass at the scene, but said the clinic itself was not damaged.  In Tin Shui Wai, about 500 people joined an officially approved rally from the Wang Yat Square shopping centre at 3pm, and marched through residential estates and public parks to raise awareness of their protest. They chanted a mixture of slogans, including the anti-government movement’s “five demands, not one less”, and also called for local consultation on the health crisis and a “full border shutdown”.   Sixteen pan-democrat Yuen Long district councillors organised the march and said there was strong local opposition to the government’s decision to use the Tin Shui Wai (Tin Yip Road) Community Health Centre to treat patients with suspected coronavirus infection.  “We are not blindly opposing the scheme, but the government has done zero explanation and zero consultation with some 60,000 local residents, many of whom are worried sick about a community outbreak,” councillor Kwok Man-ho said.  “And this is all because of the government’s stubborn refusal to close the borders with the mainland, which has brought infection to Hong Kong,” he said, adding health officials had refused to attend its three recent meetings to discuss the government’s response to the outbreak. The coronavirus, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed more than 1,500 people on the mainland, and infected over 67,000 people worldwide. In Hong Kong, 56 people have been confirmed to have the disease, and so far one person has died in the city. Hong Kong has raised its response to the highest level of emergency and implemented a string of containment and mitigation measures, including designating 18 government clinics for treating suspected coronavirus patients with mild symptoms.   The government has faced fierce local resistance in recent days over several district-based anti-contagion measures. Last month, protesters clashed heavily with police over a plan to use a newly built public housing estate in Fanling as a quarantine site. At 4pm, the Tin Shui Wai march reached its end point at the light rail station, but many protesters remained and threw two rubbish bins onto the tracks, and set fire to an Octopus card reader. An MTR employee said the fire had been put out in less than a minute, before eight firefighters arrived. But riot police stepped in, and fired pepper spray at the crowd before making arrests. Form Two secondary school student Henry Wu said police had overreacted. “Many of us were naturally shouting anti-government slogans too, because many youngsters got politically engaged during the social movement and learnt to make our voices heard through protest actions against bad government policies, such as its current response to the coronavirus outbreak,” the 13-year-old said.   A housewife surnamed Chan also took part in the march, and said the government bore the ultimate responsibility for refusing to impose “more draconian measures” such as a border shutdown to control the epidemic. “I am marching for me and my family’s health,” she said. In Tai Po and Kennedy Town, small groups marched to oppose the designation of a clinic in each of the district for treating suspected cases. “Hong Kong independence, the only way out! Completely close down the border, wait no more!” they chanted in Tai Po. At a press conference on Saturday, Dr Sara Ho Yuen-ha, the authority’s chief manager in patient safety and risk management, said she understood the public’s concern surrounding the designated clinics. “We will continue to communicate with them and different stakeholders to understand their concerns,” Ho said, adding that there was no timetable for activating the use of those clinics.

The Court of Appeal on Friday said it was “perfectly lawful” for the administration to tighten security and concluded that the restrictions imposed were “proportionate to the legitimate aims” of ensuring safe and secure operations of the government headquarters in Admiralty. It also rejected a suggestion on the symbolic significance of the forecourt, fondly labelled by pro-democracy activists as “Civic Square”, after learning that past town zoning plans actually gave the same name to Tamar Park, located on the other side of the government headquarters. “Once the so-called symbolic significance attributable to the misnomer of Civic Square is rejected, we cannot see any substantial reduction of the rights of freedom of expression and demonstrations by requiring public meetings … to be held at the designated public activities area or Tamar Park as compared with the forecourt,” the court said. “For large mass public meetings and processions, Tamar Park is the ideal location.”   But the three judges, led by the Chief Judge of the High Court Mr Justice Jeremy Poon Shiu-chor, also reminded the Director of Administration, responsible for managing the forecourt, to consider the individual circumstances of each case in the actual administration of the scheme and the enforcement of the restriction. ADVERTISING The judicial review applicant Cheung Tak-wing, a retired photographer, has vowed to take his case to the Court of Final Appeal in the name of public interest. “It’s certainly unreasonable to bar us from protesting on Monday to Friday even after we make an application,” he said, after collecting the 58-page judgment from the court. “That is a 99 per cent exploitation of our rights.” 20 Nov 2018 20 Nov 2018 The forecourt was best known as the base of protesters in a 2012 hunger strike against the proposed implementation of a Chinese national education curriculum in Hong Kong schools. national education curriculum  But it was sealed off with a three-metre-tall fence in September 2014 – in the run up to the Occupy Central movement – which prompted activists to storm the area and triggered an early start to the planned protests. Occupy Central  Three of those involved, student activists Joshua Wong Chi-fung, Nathan Law Kwun-chung and Alex Chow Yong-kang, were jailed over the incident, but were later freed by the Court of Final Appeal. Joshua Wong After Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor became the city’s leader in July 2017, she reopened the square to the public in December, but maintained the condition that those interested in using it must seek prior approval from the director of administration. Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor reopened the square   The scheme was aimed at striking a balance between the maintenance of orderly and effective operation of government offices and the need to facilitate public expression of opinions. Interested users are required to make an application to the director for permission, but no public meetings were allowed on workdays. Cheung’s application in September 2014 to use the forecourt for a public meeting to be attended by about 10 people was refused as the proposed event fell on a Friday. Is the reopening of Hong Kong’s ‘Civic Square’ just a ‘political show’? 20 Jul 2018 Is the reopening of Hong Kong’s ‘Civic Square’ just a ‘political show’? 20 Jul 2018 In November 2018, Mr Justice Thomas Au Hing-cheung of the Court of First Instance found the government’s permission scheme had disproportionately infringed on the public’s rights to freedom of expression, assembly, and to take part in public affairs, as provided by the Hong Kong Bill of Rights and the city’s mini-constitution, the Basic Law. But the director of administration countered in appeal that Au had erred in neglecting the government’s property rights. Benjamin Yu SC, for the director, pointed out that the government did not design the forecourt as a place for demonstrations.   Yu also maintained that the restrictions imposed were “proportionate”, because allowing such activities to take place on workdays would increase the likelihood of inconvenience and disturbance to civil servants. The counsel also drew the court’s attention to other alternative sites for protests, such as the designated public activities area on Tim Mei Avenue. While the court rejected Yu’s argument on property rights, it accepted that the government had never allowed the forecourt to be used as a place of mass protest and demonstration to the detriment of the normal operation of its headquarters. “It was therefore perfectly lawful for the director to decide that security measure had to be tightened up as public order events caused serious disruptions to the ordinary business carried on at the Central Government Offices,” the judgment read. Wong expressed regret at the court decision and said he would be happy to hear further clarification from the Court of Final Appeal. “The Civic Square is right at the entrance of the Central Government Offices,” he said. “Why should we go to an entirely irrelevant park?” 	SCMP

Directors Luo Huining and Fu Ziying, of the Hong Kong and Macau liaison offices respectively, will be double hatting as deputy directors of Xia’s office and report to him. Zhang, who has spent more than three decades on Hong Kong affairs, held on to his ministerial rank, although his authority was reduced to that of executive deputy director “handling day-to-day operation”.  A mainland expert familiar with Hong Kong affairs, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 56-year-old official would stay on as a member of the Communist Party’s Hong Kong and Macau affairs central coordination group chaired by Vice-Premier Han Zheng.  Han is the top-level Politburo Standing Committee member who oversees Hong Kong affairs, reporting directly to President Xi Jinping. In the briefing notes to pro-Beijing politicians, Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong highlighted positive messages about the revamp of the HKMAO. Stressing on the upgrading of the office with Xia’s appointment, it said: “The integration of the HKMAO and the liaison offices in Hong Kong and Macau is conducive to better collaboration.” However, one of the pro-Beijing politicians who received the notes believed there was a sense of Beijing holding Zhang accountable for the handling of the months-long anti-government protests in the city. “The reshuffle was arranged recently, together with the removal of top officials of Hubei province. This serves as a sense of Zhang bearing accountability,” the source, who declined to be named, said. It is not a major punishment for Zhang, but more like holding him accountable in principle Pro-Beijing source “Unlike [former Hong Kong liaison office director] Wang Zhimin, Zhang is staying in the office with his ministerial rank intact,” the politician said. “It is not a major punishment for Zhang, but more like holding him accountable in principle.” Wang was moved out as director of the liaison office in the city last month and transferred to the history research unit under the party’s Central Committee. The pro-Beijing politician said Xia, and Luo Huining who replaced Wang, were both trusted by Chinese President Xi Jinping. “With the ongoing social unrest, I believe these two men will pull no punches in fixing Beijing’s ruling policies towards Hong Kong,” he said. A mainland expert, who also declined to be named, described Xia’s appointment as director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office as a “highly unusual arrangement”. “It’s an indication of the importance attached by the central government to Hong Kong affairs. It is aimed at better coordination of work between various central government agencies on Hong Kong,” the expert said. Tam Yiu-chung, Hong Kong’s sole representative on the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, the nation’s top legislative body, said the reshuffle centred on strengthening the central government’s oversight on Hong Kong. “Xia’s appointment indicates the central government’s intention of strengthening the works on Hong Kong,” Tam said. There are many issues going on in Hong Kong that Beijing is not glad to see. If things function well, there would have been no need for such changes Ip Kwok-him, local deputy to the National People’s Congress “The installation of a heavyweight, who has a close working relationship with President Xi, can help win the support of other mainland government agencies involved in Hong Kong,” Tam said. He said the elevation of the HKMAO could help avoid potential rivalry between the cabinet-level office and the liaison office, where previously the relative hierarchy of each to the central government was ambiguous. Tam said Xia would be able to monitor the situation in Hong Kong more closely than Vice-Premier Han, who had other tasks on his plate. “Apart from Hong Kong and Macau affairs, Han has other portfolios such as public finance,” Tam said. “Xia can be more focused on his position as HKMAO head.” On whether Zhang Xiaoming was being held accountable for the crisis triggered by the extradition bill and the pro-establishment camp’s crushing defeat in November’s district council elections, Tam believed Beijing might see the need to revamp the institutions handling Hong Kong affairs after “what happened in the past eight months”. district council elections “I think the central government is very concerned about the Legislative Council elections in September,” Tam said. Zhang is no stranger to controversy in his years overseeing Hong Kong affairs. In September 2015, he claimed that the position of chief executive held a special legal status that “transcended” all three branches of government. On the emerging narrative that Zhang, like Wang, was being held accountable for the handling of the social unrest, Ip Kwok-him, a local deputy to the National People’s Congress, said: “You may understand in this way, seeing how his title has changed to deputy.” Skirmishes in Hong Kong’s Mong Kok during Lunar New Year protests Skirmishes in Hong Kong’s Mong Kok during Lunar New Year protests Ip believed the structural change had to do with the social unrest, saying: “There are many issues going on in Hong Kong that Beijing is not glad to see. If things function well, there would have been no need for such changes.” On whether Beijing would next hold Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor accountable like Zhang, Ip said he did not see such a possibility at this stage, while the pro-Beijing politician who did not wish to be named said that, given the uncertainties over the September Legislative Council elections, Beijing would prefer to tread with caution. Removing Lam could be seen as a win by the pan-democrats, already triumphant over their sweeping victory in the district council polls, the source said. By controlling the district councils, the pan-democrats secured nearly 117 seats in the 1,200 member Election Committee that selects the next chief executive. If they deliver a similarly stellar show at the Legco elections, they could secure more seats in the committee, making it harder for Beijing to be completely certain of its chosen candidate winning as chief executive. Pro-democracy camp convenor Tanya Chan of the Civic Party said Xia was a hardliner and that his appointment could signal Beijing’s tightened grip over Hong Kong. “The structure now seems like the central government is overseeing Hong Kong and Macau affairs directly, and the role of the liaison office here seems diminished.” Her views were echoed by legislator Claudia Mo Man-ching, who said Beijing would take a stronger stance on Hong Kong policy. Democratic Party lawmaker Helena Wong suggested the cause for Zhang’s demotion was his poor handling of situations such as the Occupy movement in 2014. From common sense, if Zhang was the director and suddenly he’s not, that’s a demotion and there’s no other term to describe it Ray Yep Kin-man, City University political scientist Wong added: “Few would have high hopes over the new appointments. If the central government continues to ignore Hongkongers’ views, it doesn’t matter who is the HKMAO head.” City University political scientist Ray Yep Kin-man and veteran China analyst Johnny Lau Yui-siu said Zhang was held accountable for roles during the extradition bill saga. “From common sense, if Zhang was the director and suddenly he’s not, that’s a demotion and there’s no other term to describe it. Otherwise, why is he not an adviser or some consultant?” Yep said, adding that Zhang was already the second senior Chinese official to be assigned a new role after the extradition bill saga. China coronavirus: proposed Hong Kong quarantine building in Fanling gets fire-bombed China coronavirus: proposed Hong Kong quarantine building in Fanling gets fire-bombed But Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of the semi-official Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, described Zhang’s new role as part of an “upgrade” to HKMAO. “The central government’s consolidation of the two offices shows that the issue of Hong Kong has risen to top priority, and is linked to security and national interest,” Lau said. Analysts said Beijing might want Xia and Luo, who do not have previous experience in Hong Kong affairs, to come in with a fresh take on the city’s handling of the months-long protests. Coronavirus: Heads roll in Hubei as Beijing’s patience runs out 13 Feb 2020 Coronavirus: Heads roll in Hubei as Beijing’s patience runs out 13 Feb 2020 Anthony Wu Ting-yuk, a Hong Kong member of the standing committee of the CPPCC, said the installation of a state leader as HKMAO head showed Beijing wanted to have a fresh pair of hands to deal with Hong Kong affairs. Former secretary for transport and housing Anthony Cheung Bing-leung told the Post the implications of the reshuffle should not be understated. “It would be fair to say that in politics, change of people often precedes [and opens up opportunities for] adjustments in policy one way or the other,” he said. Post “With new senior appointments of people not associated particularly with Hong Kong in the past, any policy rethink could be less burdened by set paths or preconceived views and interests.” A source close to the Hong Kong government also noted Xia’s and Luo’s lack of previous exposure to Hong Kong and foreign affairs. “There is little ground to expect Xi to relax controls over Hong Kong,” the source said.

Former Zhejiang Communist Party chief Xia Baolong, who gained a reputation as a hardliner overseeing the suppression of Christian churches in the eastern province five years ago, has been named head of the State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), according to state news agency Xinhua. The announcement shows the 67-year-old who has little experience dealing with Hong Kong, still has President Xi Jinping’s full trust, despite approaching retirement age for senior leaders in China and his rather tarnished reputation, according to observers. In his new role, Xia will have to tackle the biggest political crisis that has embroiled Hong Kong in decades, for which his predecessor Zhang Xiaoming, 56, has been widely blamed. biggest political crisis that has embroiled Hong Kong Skirmishes in Hong Kong’s Mong Kok during Lunar New Year protests Skirmishes in Hong Kong’s Mong Kok during Lunar New Year protests Gu Su, a political scientist at Nanjing University, said Xia owed much of his political fortune over the years to his close links to Xi. Xi’s ties with Xia – who rose from semi-retirement to take up a leadership role at the country’s top political advisory body two years ago, making him a state leader – date back nearly two decades when the pair worked closely in Zhejiang. ADVERTISING “While Xia is considered a capable cadre within the party, there’s no point in denying that Xi’s trust and blessing is essential for his new job when so much is at stake at the moment with regard to the situation in Hong Kong,” Gu said. China upgrades Hong Kong affairs with new chief 14 Feb 2020 China upgrades Hong Kong affairs with new chief 14 Feb 2020 Xia was born in Tianjin and was a primary school and high schoolteacher during the Cultural Revolution. He rose through the ranks in the municipality next to Beijing to become then the city’s vice-mayor in 1997. During his tenure in Tianjin, Xia, who had a degree in Chinese from a local adult education school, studied and earned a doctorate in economics at Peking University, according to Xinhua.  When he was appointed Zhejiang’s deputy party chief in November 2003, he may have little idea that his immediate boss and then provincial party chief Xi would later rise to become the country’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. But nearly 14 years later when he left Zhejiang as the province’s top party cadre in 2017, Xia did not hold back in expressing gratitude for the opportunity to work with Xi for nearly four years before Xi was appointed party chief of Shanghai in 2007.  “I am fortunate to become a member of the ‘Iron Army’ in Zhejiang,” he said in his official farewell speech, using a term he coined to refer to officials who worked with Xi during his rise mostly in Zhejiang but also in Shanghai, Shaanxi and Fujian. “It is the greatest fortune of my life to be transferred to Zhejiang and have a prominent platform to fulfil my personal ambitions and serve the party and the state,” Xia said in the speech in April 2017. “Each and every step of progress we’ve achieved in Zhejiang should be attributed to General Secretary [Xi’s] guidance and care. To speak from my heart, it is the greatest fortune of the nation, the party and the people to have Xi Jinping as the core of the party central.” What next for the heavy-handed cross toppler close to Xi Jinping? 20 Jul 2018 What next for the heavy-handed cross toppler close to Xi Jinping? 20 Jul 2018 The officials around Xi are better known as the “New Zhejiang Army”, and comprise more than a dozen of Xi’s top proteges and allies, including Xia, and Cai Qi, Li Qiang and Chen Miner – the party chiefs of Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing. Former Shanghai mayor Ying Yong, who was named Hubei’s new party boss on Wednesday, is also seen as a member of Xi’s Zhejiang clique. During Xia’s 14 years in Zhejiang, the eastern province rose to become one of the most affluent areas in the country, with its total economic output increasing five-fold to reach nearly 4.65 trillion yuan (US$654 billion) by the end of 2016. Hong Kong protest supporters hold independent Lunar New Year fairs across the city Hong Kong protest supporters hold independent Lunar New Year fairs across the city Xia, whose stint as Zhejiang’s party boss came after Xi became the country’s supreme leader, has also been an advocate of Xi’s policies and achievements. One of the highlights of Xia’s tenure in Zhejiang was the 2016 Group of 20 summit in Hangzhou, the province’s capital city, which Xia helped prepare. According to Chinese media, Xia said Xi was highly satisfied with the extravagant gathering of world leaders, which took millions of US dollars and months to prepare. Xi also reportedly praised Zhejiang and Hangzhou authorities for their “strict security measures” and “reliable logistics support”. But the weeks of exceptionally tight security measures Xia’s government imposed for the gathering, also met with widespread discontent and criticism. Coronavirus: Beijing purges Communist Party heads in Hubei over outbreak response 14 Feb 2020 Coronavirus: Beijing purges Communist Party heads in Hubei over outbreak response 14 Feb 2020 An online critique by Guo Enping, a public servant in Taizhou, titled “Hangzhou, Shame on You” went viral on the internet and incensed Xia and local authorities. Guo was fired and detained for 10 days for “causing disturbances by fabricating rumours” that claimed the government had spent 160 billion yuan ahead of the summit to turn the city into one “which is simply superficially decorated”. While Xia was known for his bold, hardworking style, his stint in Zhejiang was largely marred by a campaign against religious freedom he personally led in 2015, which saw the toppling of more than 1,000 crosses from church roofs and the destruction of entire church buildings across the province.   The crackdown was reportedly prompted by a visit Xi made to Wenzhou in late 2013 when he questioned the prominence of the city’s church buildings. Xia was also reportedly incensed by the spread of the religion in Wenzhou, dubbed “China’s Jerusalem” due to its large and vibrant Christian population. He ordered a demolition campaign which prompted a public outcry and protests among the local Christian community and made international headlines. “China’s Jerusalem” Analysts said that Xia’s hardened stance, in the name of clearing illegal structures, was probably due to the backing of the top leadership in Beijing under Xi, who has been hostile towards religious freedom – something the party sees as a threat to its authoritarian rule. They said Xia appeared to have shared a similar hardline approach with Xi and many other members of his Zhejiang group on how to maintain stability when it comes to handling civil society and dissidents. Wen Kejian, an independent political analyst based in Hangzhou, said many in Zhejiang, including government officials, were not happy with Xia, who was headstrong and uncompromising when dealing with dissent and Christian churches. “A lot of people celebrated when he left Zhejiang three years ago,” he said. Gu and other analysts noted that Xia might face an immediate test as many in Hong Kong would view him suspiciously and even negatively over his controversial role in church demolitions across Zhejiang. “But his rich experience in coastal regions and his personal ties with Xi in particular may give him better access to the top leadership, which matters more for party officials,” Gu said. Gu said Xia’s incumbent position as vice-chairman and secretary general of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, would also be useful because the advisory body was the party’s main arm in its united front work, aimed at rallying support from outside the party and around the world. But Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London, said Xia’s appointment might be bad news for Hong Kong. “Given his background as an enforcer for Xi and the lack of experience or network in Hong Kong, he is clearly chosen to enforce Xi’s hardline policy on the city,” he said. He said Xia’s new role at the Hong Kong body, coinciding with the reshuffle of Hubei government over the ongoing coronavirus crisis, may not be a coincidence. “As to the timing, we need to bear in mind that the HKMAO appointment would have been in the pipeline, but there is no particular time pressure for the announcement to be made now. It was announced with the leadership change in Hubei to show Xi’s strength,” he said.

The major shake-up of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) ­– coming after months of social turmoil and anti-government protest violence in Hong Kong, and as the city reels from the ongoing coronavirus crisis – still leaves Zhang running daily operations as executive deputy director with his ministerial rank intact. anti-government protest Xia, the secretary general and vice-chairman of the country’s top political advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), will be the HKMAO’s director. He has a reputation for being hard-handed and is widely regarded as a trusted ally of President Xi Jinping, as they worked together for more than four years in Zhejiang province in the mid-2000s – Xi as Communist Party chief and Xia his deputy. The reshuffle was also seen as leaving Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor in no doubt as to the reporting hierarchy – the leaders of Hong Kong and Macau were previously ranked at the same level as the directors of the two offices. Lam extended a “warm welcome” to Xia in his new role, issuing a statement saying: “The appointment of Mr Xia as the HKMAO director in addition to his capacity as the vice-chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC is testimony to the importance the central government attaches to Hong Kong and Macau affairs.”  Tam Yiu-chung, Hong Kong’s sole representative in China’s top legislative body, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, said the reshuffle was aimed at boosting the implementation of the central government policies for the city. “The installation of a heavyweight, who has a close working relationship with President Xi Jinping, can help win the support of other mainland government agencies regarding the work on Hong Kong,” Tam said. Teachers say they live in fear for criticising government during protests 10 Feb 2020 Teachers say they live in fear for criticising government during protests 10 Feb 2020 Opposition politicians raised concerns that it would mean a tightening of Beijing’s grip on Hong Kong, citing Xia’s hardliner reputation, but also expressed hope that state leaders would get a better idea of the situation in the city.    Li Xiaobing, a Hong Kong specialist and law professor at Nankai University in Tianjin, said: “Zhang Xiaoming’s career is limited to the Hong Kong-Macau system. Xia’s appointment will broaden the knowledge and scope of the team working for Hong Kong-Macau affairs.” A source familiar with the situation said Xia would join the top-level working group headed by Vice-Premier Han Zheng that decides Beijing’s policies for Hong Kong and Macau. Zhang would continue to serve as a member of the working group, as “he continues to lead the work of the secretariat”, a source said. The HKMAO, being the group’s secretariat, plays a facilitator role between the two special administrative regions and the central government, which often overlaps with Beijing’s liaison offices in the two cities. Besides Xia’s appointment, Beijing’s top envoys to Hong Kong and Macau will take up new roles in the HKMAO, too – directors Luo Huining and Fu Ziying, of the Hong Kong and Macau liaison offices respectively, will double as deputy directors of Xia’s office and report to him. Another source familiar with the matter said the new arrangement would fix reporting-line issues because the HKMAO had effectively been “promoted” to a level above Beijing’s liaison offices. “Although Zhang has become the deputy executive director in charge of daily operations now, his role has remained largely unchanged,” the source said, adding that the new structure would also further improve communication with the Beijing-based HKMAO. Qin Qianhong, a Hong Kong affairs expert and law professor at Wuhan University, said: “Previously, the HKMAO might want to do something, but the liaison offices might have their own minds about it. Standing at the same rank, they might hold each other back. Now with Xia, who is clearly from higher up, the overall planning and coordination will be better.” The shake-up comes about a month after Beijing replaced its top representative in Hong Kong in the first major leadership reshuffle since the anti-government protests broke out in June. Luo, a former provincial party chief with no relevant experience in Hong Kong but a reputation for being Beijing’s stern enforcer, was called out of semi-retirement to take over from Wang Zhimin last month. called out of semi-retirement to take over Beijing’s new man in Hong Kong: how the ‘odd choice’ of Luo Huining could signal a change in thinking 17 Feb 2020 Beijing’s new man in Hong Kong: how the ‘odd choice’ of Luo Huining could signal a change in thinking 17 Feb 2020 Wang was blamed in some quarters for the turmoil that escalated under his watch, as the protests first sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill expanded into a wider anti-government campaign that was marked by mass rallies and street violence. Unlike Zhang, who gets to keep both his job portfolio and rank, Wang held on to his ministerial rank but was booted out of the Hong Kong-Macau supervisory system and transferred to the history research unit under the party’s Central Committee.

An insider said officers believed the young man used his bank account to collect the cash on behalf of his friend, who was arrested for a protest-related offence last year. Police said in December they suspected that dozens of teenagers were each paid thousands of Hong Kong dollars through the online fundraising platform Spark Alliance HK to join anti-government demonstrations sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. said in December extradition bill The group, which was set up after the Mong Kok riot in 2016 to help arrested and jailed activists, raised about HK$80 million in the second quarter of last year for those who met the same fate in the protests that broke out last summer.

Police believed the funds were used for personal gain and other potentially illegal activities, such as rewarding young people financially for joining demonstrations, many of which descended into violence.

According to police, the unemployed teenager received HK$48,000 over the period between the end of October and November last year.  After further investigation, police arrested the 18-year-old man at Nam Shan Estate in Shek Kip Mei on Tuesday evening.  He has been accused of selling illegal drugs to a man and two women aged between 26 and 35, who were arrested for possession. During the operation, officers said they seized HK$8,000 worth of illegal drugs including ketamine, cocaine and cannabis.   Laying out the force’s reasons for making the money laundering arrest, Superintendent Chan Wai-kei of the narcotics bureau said: “The 18-year-old arrested man was jobless. We found that from the end of October to the end of November last year, he had received HK$48,000 from a shell company. “The 18-year-old arrested man was jobless. “This was something never seen in his account and he had no relation with this shell company, so we have reasons to believe that these are crime proceeds.” Superintendent Raymond Chou, also of the narcotics bureau, said the suspect was likely to be prosecuted for trafficking dangerous drugs.

That fund said it had raised HK$97.1 million as of November 30, helping 6,949 people by spending HK$23.3 million mostly on their economic, legal and medical needs. Vehement opposition to proposed changes to Hong Kong’s extradition laws triggered the outbreak of the protests last June, but soon developed into a wider anti-government movement focused on democratic reforms and police accountability. The demonstrations have regularly plunged into violence, with police and radicals trading tear gas and petrol bombs. 	SCMP

Say no to the quarantine centre,” they chanted, as they marched in Fo Tan, Sha Tin. Most of them were set to move into the new estate next month, but only received an SMS from the Housing Department on Tuesday notifying them of a change in plans. The controversy centred on a U-turn by city leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, who earlier pledged that no new public housing estates would be used for quarantine purposes. She appealed for understanding to use the Fo Tan site, saying existing quarantine centres were fully occupied and there was a desperate need for more places. Quarantine furore says much about what’s wrong with HK 27 Jan 2020 Quarantine furore says much about what’s wrong with HK 27 Jan 2020 But residents were frustrated and angry over the lack of consultation.  Debbie Law, a mother of two, said: “No one notified us until the SMS came in yesterday. “They did not mention any compensation. We waited eight years to move into public housing. It is just unfair!”  The estate, located in an industrial area, is set to house around 4,800 families.   Another mother, Nikki Wong, 30, joined the protest with her seven-year-old daughter. “We have waited for 6½ years. My husband is working in the retail sector and has suffered under the economic downturn over the past months,” she said.  “We can barely afford the rent, and just wish to move into the new flat to improve our living environment.” Wong added that her family of three had scrambled to cough up the $7,000 monthly rent for their subdivided flat. Another woman surnamed Kwok, who waited seven years for public housing, described her disappointment as “falling from heaven”. China coronavirus: proposed Hong Kong quarantine building in Fanling gets fire-bombed China coronavirus: proposed Hong Kong quarantine building in Fanling gets fire-bombed She said although she understood the need for quarantine centres, she believed there were other solutions and accused the government of acting too slow in closing the borders with mainland China. Other residents living in Fo Tan were among the protesters, with some worrying their health would be in danger, although medical experts had suggested the distance between all designated facilities and residential zones was adequate. “The problem is that we have no confidence in the government. There is no assurance that police will be on guard to prevent anyone from the quarantine site coming out,” a resident who only gave her name as Judith, 27, said.   A retired couple who also lives in the area and who only gave their family name as Chu said they were “not blindly opposing the government”, but were unsatisfied with the lack of transparency. “If the government told us earlier and assured us with a basket of preventive measures against the outbreak, there will be less opposition,” Chu said. “Can’t they use the camp site of the People’s Liberation Army?” The protest march lasted two hours, under the watchful eye of riot police. Officers raised a blue warning flag for illegal assembly and banned participants from coming near the estate concerned.

The 10 men and two women, aged from 14 to 28, were arrested about 400 metres away from an area where anti-government protesters had set up road barricades half an hour earlier. Reflective safety vests with labels reading “first aid”, communication devices, posters printed with political demands and slogans, gloves, helmets and gas masks were confiscated from the group, police said. Speaking on Wednesday, Superintendent Iu Wing-kan, assistant Kwai Tsing district commander, said police were investigating whether the 12 suspects were linked to the illegal road blockage and if they had falsely identified themselves as first aid workers. “Initial investigation showed the arrested suspects did not have any qualification to administer first aid,” he said.  All 12 were arrested on suspicion of unlawful assembly and possession of instruments fit for unlawful purpose. The superintendent went on to condemn those who set up the road barricades, saying the act brought “more trouble and chaos to the community” as the city battles the coronavirus outbreak.

They have also attacked police officers on the front line, hurling petrol bombs and bricks.  Police have responded by firing more than 16,000 rounds of tear gas, 10,000 rubber bullets, 2,000 beanbag rounds and 19 live rounds. So far, more than 7,000 people have been arrested for various protest-related offences, including rioting, possessing explosives and firearms without a licence, and arson.

The man, surnamed Lee, who is not being fully named because of a court order, had four rounds of surgeries to have skin transplanted onto his burn wounds. But the procedures were so painful that Lee said he would rather give up further rounds of skin grafting. Lee’s latest condition was disclosed in a post on the Facebook page of pro-Beijing legislator Elizabeth Quat, who visited him and his wife at their home last Saturday. The 57-year-old man was reportedly involved in an argument with masked protesters who rampaged through Ma On Shan MTR station during an anti-government protest on November 11. Online footage showed the father of two being doused with flammable liquid and then set alight. He was sent to hospital in a critical condition with burns to at least a third of his body.

He said he was a bit impulsive, but would not be frightened off. He said he would stand up and speak out in the future whenever he saw injustice.”  “He stressed: ‘It was not me who had done anything wrong’,” Quat said, recalling her chat with Lee over the weekend. “It was an inhumane attack. What had he done? He did not do anything wrong. I hope police bring the perpetrators to justice soon,” Quat added.  She said Lee was weak but positive.  “But he said the previous surgeries were too painful. Besides the painful skin grafts, the wounds on his thigh from where skin was taken also hurt much. So, he did not want to do another round of skin grafting,” Quat said. “He said it was very painful. The wounds would itch and he could not sleep well,” she added. Quat said Lee was pleased he could return home at last, but the road to recovery was still very long. Nurses will regularly visit him to check on his progress. She said the family thanked the public for their care and support but they would not entertain the press or make any public appearances for the sake of privacy and health.

The letters warned them if they were to commit professional misconduct again, they risked losing their jobs. The latest available figures from the bureau showed that out of 147 complaints received between June and December, wrongdoing had been confirmed in 65. Some 32 cases have been closed, with follow-up actions taken. Chow recalled the complainer had written a letter directly to the bureau. The complainer’s identity has not been revealed. “When I wrote the comments, I was merely expressing some of my feelings about the prevailing political situation, but the complainer saw it differently and felt it was inappropriate,” Chow said. Teachers ‘not given a chance to defend themselves’ after Hong Kong protests 20 Dec 2019 Teachers ‘not given a chance to defend themselves’ after Hong Kong protests 20 Dec 2019 The bureau later concluded some social media posts Chow shared on Facebook were inappropriate.  It also warned of dismissal if the misconduct was repeated. But Chow said while some of the Facebook posts criticised the government’s policies, they were mild and contained no insults, hate speech, or foul remarks.  The posts were also strictly for Facebook friends, which did not include any students or their parents, the teacher added. “I don’t know how the complainer could have got that information.  “I felt so sad and angry. A teacher should also be able to enjoy basic freedom of speech on private social media platforms, but now I feel like the freedom to be able to express myself has been compromised,” Chow said. I felt so sad and angry. A teacher should also be able to enjoy basic freedom of speech on private social media platforms Charlie Chow (name changed), teacher Chow was among more than 20 teachers who complained to the Professional Teachers’ Union, the largest teachers’ union in Hong Kong, representing about 85 per cent of educators.

Hong Kong school says it will not interfere in teacher’s political views 13 Sep 2019 Hong Kong school says it will not interfere in teacher’s political views 13 Sep 2019 The union criticised the bureau for not giving clear examples of remarks that could constitute professional misconduct, which made it difficult for teachers to follow a set practice.

Another educator against whom a complaint was lodged was Law Pei-lee, a primary school teacher for 27 years, who has now been elected a pro-democracy district councillor. She said her school was notified by the bureau last September after a parent complained she had been “spreading fears and bias among young students”. Arrested teacher suspended following appeal from government 12 Dec 2019 Arrested teacher suspended following appeal from government 12 Dec 2019 She said the letter claimed she praised students who had joined protests and talked in class about the case of Lam Wing-kee, a Causeway Bay bookseller who went missing and was later found in mainland custody three years ago.

How the coronavirus crisis is changing Hong Kong’s protest movement	When about 9,000 medical workers went on strike for five days early this month, it signalled not only their dissatisfaction with the Hong Kong government’s handling of the new coronavirus outbreak, but also a change in the city’s protest movement. coronavirus outbreak protest movement After more than eight months of anti-government street marches, violence and vandalism, with riot police responding by firing tear gas and other crowd-dispersal weapons, the health crisis led to protests being called off. New police tactics since the new year, with officers intervening earlier at demonstrations to end violence and arrest protesters, also had the effect of keeping protesters away. But declining crowd sizes at protests were no indication that the social unrest was over, said Eric Lai Yan-ho, deputy convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front that organised seven mass rallies between last June and January 1 this year, including four which it said drew more than a million participants. “Street protests are just a part of the movement,” he said.  The arrival of the coronavirus crisis provided the anti-government camp with an opportunity to revitalise its resistance, offering a glimpse of the shape of protests to come. The front joined forces with pro-democracy lawmakers and district councillors to stage a citywide signature campaign slamming the government’s failure to control the spread of the new coronavirus. The online petition gathered more than 35,000 signatures.    It was organised by the new Hospital Authority Employees Alliance, which said its membership soared from 300 in December to more than 18,000 in less than two months of mobilisation. Its members represent 22.5 per cent of the 80,000-strong workforce in the statutory body that manages all public hospitals and clinics in the city, the second-largest employer after the government.   The medical sector has established unions such as the Hong Kong Public Doctors’ Association and the Association of Hong Kong Nursing Staff, but before the alliance was set up, a large number of health care workers, including allied health workers and clerical support staff, were not unionised. The alliance is one of several new unions to emerge from the social unrest. The Labour Department confirmed that 27 unions were formed in a month this year as of last Thursday, compared with 23 in the whole of 2019 and 13 in 2018. Some of the new unions represent workers not previously covered by any registered unions, such as the Bartenders and Mixologists Union, Testing and Certification Union and Event Professionals Union. Some expect to attract significant numbers because of the size of their employers, including the Union for New Civil Servants, a union for MTR workers called Railway Power, and the Hong Kong Financial Industry Employees General Union. These were among about 50 new unions and pro-democracy groups who openly supported the medical workers’ strike. Chris Chan King-chi, associate professor in sociology at Chinese University (CUHK), said the alliance’s high membership and the range of medical workers it represented gave it significant collective power to pressure the government. A scholar of unionism and former labour organiser, he said previous significant strikes, including one by iron workers in 2007 and another by dock workers in 2013, involved no more than 1,000 union members. The high number of medical workers who went on strike reflected their unhappiness with the government, as well as a sense of despair accumulated through the months of protests last year, he added. A survey conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute in late January showed that 75 per cent of respondents were not satisfied with the government’s response to the virus outbreak and 80 per cent supported a total shutdown of the border to travellers from the mainland. “The strike, backed by people from all walks of life, has opened new dimensions in the labour movement and has a far-reaching impact for labour resistance in future,” Chan said. With this, he added, the government and large institutions had been put on notice to expect more long-term and organised forms of confrontation with their workers. Missing from the front line Missing from the front line Hong Kong’s long season of unrest was triggered by the government’s now-withdrawn extradition bill which would have seen fugitives returned to mainland China as well as other jurisdictions. extradition bill Opposition to the bill began as early as last March with peaceful protests, but as Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor proved determined to push it through, large-scale protests erupted in June. Although the hugely unpopular bill was finally withdrawn in September, the protest movement morphed into a wider anti-government and anti-mainland campaign, with demands for an inquiry into alleged police brutality, amnesty for protesters who had been arrested, and universal suffrage, among others.   Observers have noted that in the weeks following the sweeping victory of pan-democratic candidates at last November’s district council elections, protest crowds have shrunk, with lunchtime protests attracting mere dozens compared with the hundreds who gathered daily in Central earlier. last November’s district council elections Protest fatigue might be one explanation for the smaller crowds, according to political scientist Ma Ngok of CUHK. But he noted that Hong Kong’s new police chief had changed the way the force responded, especially to violence, and thought this might have discouraged people from joining protests. “The police strategy now is to make peaceful marchers bear high risks even at police-approved protests,” he said. For example, the approved New Year’s Day march was the first major protest since Police Commissioner Chris Tang Ping-keung took command of the 31,000-strong force in November. took command When some protesters vandalised a branch of HSBC bank in Wan Chai, police acted swiftly, asking the organisers to end the march. More than 400 people were arrested, the highest number in a single day since June. protesters vandalised a branch of HSBC bank Four days later, at a Sheung Shui protest organised by the Democratic Party, about 100 people were detained. Then, on January 19, police halted a gathering at Chater Garden and fired tear gas to disperse the crowds soon after skirmishes broke out between protesters and officers. As of January 23, police have arrested 7,165 people, and more than 500 have been charged with rioting. Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos Just a few weeks ago, regular frontline protester Alan (not his real name) was feeling disheartened by the dwindling numbers at anti-government marches. The 32-year-old freelance cook was masked, dressed in black and wearing a helmet when he took part in the January 1 march which ended with riot police firing tear gas to disperse the crowd in Wan Chai. He recalled that as he ran down the main street to snuff out tear gas canisters, the sea of protesters clapped and moved aside, creating a path for him. Then he realised there was no one else in full protest gear confronting police. “People encouraged me to enter the battlefield, but my comrades at the front line were gone,” Alan said. Morale among his small group of frontline protesters sank to its lowest, he said, and he stopped going to protests. Since Hong Kong reported its first two cases of coronavirus infection on January 22, many planned gatherings and marches were called off and there have been only a few spontaneous protests and acts of vandalism. On January 31, Alan returned to the street, and was at the Prince Edward MTR station to mark five months since police officers stormed the station, sparking rumours that three protesters died – an allegation the force and government have strenuously denied. The crowd was smaller than at past protests but he was struck by the fact that everyone present – demonstrators as well as residents and bystanders – was wearing a surgical mask. “Previously, we risked arrest for wearing a mask,” he said, referring to last October’s ban on the use of face coverings at protests. “Now, how ridiculous it is that police fear us if we don’t wear a mask and cough at them.” ban on the use of face coverings at protests He never felt safer from the risk of arrest, he said. ‘They will be back’ ‘They will be back’ The question is what happens after the ongoing health crisis ends – will street protests be a thing of the past, or will new forms of anti-government resistance proliferate? A joint study by scholars from three universities has found that the solidarity between protest radicals remains strong enough to keep the movement going, at least for the foreseeable future. The study was done by City University public policy associate professor Edmund Cheng Wai, Lingnan University political scientist Samson Yuen Wai-hei, and Chinese University journalism and communications professor Francis Lee Lap-fung. Coronavirus crisis injects new life into Hong Kong ‘revolution’ with toxic results Coronavirus crisis injects new life into Hong Kong ‘revolution’ with toxic results Cheng said that since early November, the number of posts on LIHKG Forum, a Reddit-like platform protesters used to discuss plans and pro-democracy events, fell significantly compared with June last year. Big data analysts had earlier also reported a sharp decline in protest-related online activities over the past two months. He said protesters now tended to coordinate among themselves through private channels and chat groups, such as the encrypted messaging application Telegram and Firechat, which ensure confidentiality. The study also showed that unlike 2014’s Occupy movement, which ended with deep divisions between protesters, a large number of peaceful demonstrators remained firmly behind the radicals in the current protests. Occupy movement The scholars’ analysis of 18,000 questionnaires collected at protest sites from June to early January showed a high level of solidarity among protesters, with respondents strongly agreeing that “the peaceful faction and militant faction are in the same boat” and that “it is understandable for protesters to take radical action when the government acts in disregard of people’s opinions”. Cheng warned that a political powder keg would remain in Hong Kong society if root problems remained unsolved and the anger of the people lingered. “They will be back on the streets again. It need not be related to police brutality, the extradition bill or virus control measures, but any controversial policy might spark a public outcry,” he said, noting that city leader Carrie Lam’s support rating has plummeted from 64 points when she took office in 2017 to just 21 points in mid January – the lowest score for any chief executive. The government’s recent performance has accelerated the pro-democracy campaign Professor Paul Yip, HKU University of Hong Kong social sciences professor Paul Yip Siu-fai said the government’s failure to grasp a golden opportunity to rebuild trust with the people during the virus crisis had instead helped the protest movement. “The government’s recent performance has accelerated the pro-democracy campaign to progress to a new stage – from street protests to everyday protests,” he said. The pro-democracy camp is already mobilising eligible voters to register for the Legislative Council elections in September. Legislative Council Chinese University’s Ma hoped Beijing would review hardline policies towards Hong Kong after failing to grasp the sentiment expressed by voters who inflicted a humiliating defeat on pro-government candidates in last November’s district council elections. “If police further escalate their use of force against protesters, resistance by people from all walks of life will persist in more diversified forms and the pro-Beijing camp may suffer another defeat in the coming elections for the legislature,” he said. But Beijing loyalist Lau Siu-kai believes the central government recognises the Hong Kong police force’s efforts in deterring radicals, and will continue to rely on law enforcement bodies. Lau, who is vice-chairman of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, is also sceptical over the virus crisis boosting the anti-government movement. “The opposition continues to create issues in the health crisis to spread anti-mainland sentiments, but this tactic cannot be sustained in the long run,” he said. “People will eventually know who sacrificed professionalism in the medical workers’ strike for political goals.” Protester Alan, for one, is not ready to give up the fight. “Retreating from street battles doesn’t mean withdrawing from the war,” he said, adding that the protest mantra “Be water” was not merely a call to hit and run. “We know it’s a long fight. It’s about flexibility and adaptability. We’ll observe, reform and fight back until the government heeds our demands,” he said. 	SCMP

China Daily The sharply worded document addressed to Attorney General William Barr called on the Department of Justice to “clamp down on Chinese propaganda”, investigate the media organisation’s “important role in China’s foreign disinformation campaign” and address its “repeated violations” of a US law requiring that foreign lobbyists register and provide detailed reports on their financial activities. “China Daily’s important role in China’s foreign disinformation campaign warrants a full-fledged investigation,” said the letter, initiated by Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton and Indiana Republican Congressman Jim Banks and co-signed by seven other Republican senators and 26 representatives. China Daily Calls and emails to the US offices of state-owned China Daily went unanswered. On its website, the newspaper describes itself as a “default choice” with “over 200 million readers” and a “channel for information exchanges between China and the rest of the world”. China Daily The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The letter, sent Thursday and released on Friday, said China had poured US$35 million into China Daily since 2017 as part of a multibillion US dollar foreign propaganda campaign over the past decade. China Daily  This, it added, presented a “distorted account of Chinese Communist Party policy” and “the party’s relationship with the United States to an English-speaking audience” in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). China Daily registered under FARA in 1983 but has repeatedly failed to report what it has spent in the US, including money to insert its content and special sections in some 30 independent newspapers that “portray the Chinese Communist Party in a positive light”, the letter said. China Daily  “One is compliance with reporting requirements under FARA,” said Steven Butler, Asia programme coordinator with the Committee to Protect Journalists. “China Daily has been registered under FARA for many years, voluntarily I presume.” China Daily  “If they failed to comply with reporting requirements under the act, that’s a law enforcement issue, akin to not declaring taxable income,” he said.  On the second point, he said: “As for serving as a propaganda arm of the Chinese government, I’m not aware that dishing out propaganda on behalf of a foreign government is a crime.” The letter acknowledges that some of China Daily’s articles are harmless, such as those that focus on an initiative by the government to promote fitness. China Daily But others, it said, were of greater concern. These include inserts in the The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal that “serve as cover for China’s atrocities, including its crimes against humanity against Uygurs in the Xinjiang region and its support for the crackdown in Hong Kong”. The Washington Post The Wall Street Journal Uygur woman describes torture in China’s Xinjiang ‘vocational training’ camps Uygur woman describes torture in China’s Xinjiang ‘vocational training’ camps Beijing’s mass detention and re-education of Muslims in China’s far western autonomous region of Xinjiang have been condemned by many Western countries and advocacy groups including Human Rights Watch. Last month, the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China charged that Beijing may be committing crimes against humanity with the incarceration of more than 1 million people in Xinjiang. “China’s massive financial commitment speaks to the seriousness of their effort to sway foreign sentiment,” the letter said. “Propaganda that seeks to obfuscate communist atrocities deserves to be counteracted.” Traditionally, penalties for violating FARA – passed in 1938 to counter Nazi propaganda – have been rare because it as originally written it required proof that someone acted “wilfully”, a difficult legal bar. Between 1966 and 2015, the Justice Department only brought seven criminal FARA cases with just three convictions. Coronavirus: China tightens social media censorship amid outbreak 14 Feb 2020 Coronavirus: China tightens social media censorship amid outbreak 14 Feb 2020 But the law has been rewritten to make it tougher. Last year, Paul Manafort, who served as campaign manager for President Donald Trump leading up to his 2016 election, pleaded guilty for failing to register under FARA as a lobbyist for Ukraine. The media has become one more battleground between the United States and China, joining trade, technology, defence and education, among others. In February 2019 the US arm of China’s state broadcaster CGTN America registered under FARA. Then in June it was denied passes to cover Capitol Hill under FARA’s ramped up use of FARA. NBA game in Shanghai goes ahead amid China's fury over pro-Hong Kong tweet NBA game in Shanghai goes ahead amid China's fury over pro-Hong Kong tweet A memo leaked to BuzzFeed in 2019 said CGTN decided to register under FARA “in the spirit of cooperation”. Concerns about the national security implications of Chinese organisations operating in the US gathered momentum after lawmakers called in 2017 for greater scrutiny of Chinese investments in the US. That has since led to stricter vetting over foreign acquisitions by the inter-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. This week’s letter cited this summer’s boycott of the National Basketball Association after one of the team’s managers voiced support for Hong Kong in a tweet that “show the lengths China will go to protect its international image”. The letter said FARA regulations gave it the tools to “fight pernicious foreign influence” and that “the DOJ should use them to clamp down on Chinese propaganda”. The letter ended by calling on the Justice Department to mount an investigation into the extent of China Daily’s FARA violations, produce a report, schedule a briefing for Congress and recommend actions for Congress to take. China Daily “General Secretary Xi Jinping is unquestionably committed to shifting foreign perceptions of the Chinese Communist Party,” the letter said. “And China’s financial commitment to foreign propaganda outlets is the proof in the pudding.” Purchase the China AI Report 2020 brought to you by SCMP Research and enjoy a 20% discount (original price US$400).

The newcomers include Alan Leong Kah-kit, chairman of the pro-democracy Civic Party, as well as retired journalist Kwan Hing-ning and advertising industry employee Ivan Mok Ka-kit, a pro-establishment candidate who was defeated in last November’s district council elections. Many have attracted a growing following, reflecting the demand for insights into the social unrest that has plagued Hong Kong for nearly eight months. Survey says 80 per cent of Hong Kong protesters support ‘one country, two systems’ 17 Jan 2020 Survey says 80 per cent of Hong Kong protesters support ‘one country, two systems’ 17 Jan 2020 “We’ve noted a huge demand for views of opinion leaders since the anti-government crisis started in June,” said Lau Sai-leung, a writer who served as an adviser to the Central Policy Unit from 2006 to 2012. He started his online radio website, Singjai.com, in June 2014 but saw the audience for his current affairs programme, Loudzone, rise sharply over the past seven months. Loudzone,  He puts out three episodes each week, and the number of hits for each episode peaked at nearly 300,000 last August and September. “Our subscribers on YouTube surged from 70,000 in June to 230,000 recently,” said Lau, who supports the protest movement.  He believes the growing interest in programmes like his reflects Hongkongers’ hunger to make sense of events in the city.  “For many Hong Kong people, what has been happening since June is something novel and unexpected,” he said. “They look for online news commentary programmes to understand what is going on.” Among the newcomers sharing their views online is Civic Party chairman Leong, who started his YouTube channel last July and has seen his following grow from about 80,000 hits last August to about 120,000 in early January. Retired journalist and veteran political commentator Kwan started his YouTube programme last November and saw the number of hits rise from several thousand initially to more than 50,000 last month.   A former senior editor of regional Chinese-language news magazine Yazhou Zhoukan and editorial writer of the Oriental Press Group, he said: “I am well versed in politics in mainland China and Hong Kong and these are the major topics I deal with on my programme. I hope to give some insights and perspectives to my viewers.” Yazhou Zhoukan His episode on the appointment of Luo Huining as director of the central government’s liaison office in Hong Kong scored more than 50,000 hits in December. “Viewers wanted to hear my views on why Luo replaced Wang Zhimin as Beijing’s top envoy to Hong Kong in the first major leadership change since anti-government protests broke out in June,” Kwan said. Alan Leong, who has been running his programme on a weekly basis, said: “It was good to have a platform that can reach out to audience, especially those in overseas.” “I feel distinctly some local media platforms are playing certain distance from me on certain subjects. So my online programme can provide uncensored platform for me to share my thoughts,” he said. Indonesian domestic worker deported after covering Hong Kong protests Indonesian domestic worker deported after covering Hong Kong protests Defeated election candidate Mok is a YouTuber with an unabashedly pro-government stance and has already attracted more than 66,000 subscribers. The 24-year-old started his programme in early December, and often uses it to criticise the pan-democratic camp and radical protesters for undermining the city’s stability. “I hope to voice out alternative views to counter the YouTubers who support pan-democrats and protesters,” Mok said. “I also criticised the government for its slow actions to contain the spread of Wuhan coronavirus,” he said. Nearly a fifth Hong Kong voters say they support violent protests 21 Dec 2019 Nearly a fifth Hong Kong voters say they support violent protests 21 Dec 2019 Mok ran his programmes every day and collected nearly HK$3,000 in January. Joseph Chan Man, emeritus professor of journalism and communications at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that in times of social unrest, people tend to seek explanations of current affairs. “They want something more than what is reported by traditional media outlets,” he said. Finance sector consultant Gordon Poon tung-hoi, who started his YouTube programme in 2017 with three episodes a week, doubled his output after the protests began last June. He scores between 10,000 and 50,000 hits per episode. “Apart from current affairs in Hong Kong, I also talk about history and political concepts, such as the origin of totalitarianism,” said Poon, who is sympathetic towards the pan-democrat camp. “I hope to educate my viewers so they will be better equipped if they take part in social movements.” So far, the YouTube commentators say there is no big money to be made from sharing their views. Lau Sai-leung said his programme gets two or three online advertisements per episode if the hit rate exceeds 200,000 – and that has happened regularly since last August. A 13-year-old Hong Kong protester shares his story A 13-year-old Hong Kong protester shares his story “That brings about HK$1,200 for each episode,” he said. “My programme has three episodes a week, so we have been collecting more than HK$14,000 per month.”    But Lau said the advertising revenue was not enough to cover the operation costs for his online radio website. He said a dozen viewers made regular donations, but he declined to disclose the amount. “Drawing a monthly income of several thousand dollars still sounds good if you have your own job and host online commentary programmes in your spare time,” he said. Professor Francis Lee Lap-fung, director of the school of journalism and communication at Chinese University, said YouTubers who hope to attract ads have to show they can attract a big enough niche audience. “There are limits to growing online ad revenue for news commentary programmes which are not tied to any particular category in the consumer market,” he said. “For advertisers, YouTube food or travel programmes may be better targets for placing their ads.

Revenue for the restaurant sector fell 5.9 per cent to HK$112.5 billion (US$14.5 billion) in 2019 from the previous year, according to provisional data from the Census and Statistics Department released on Wednesday. A government spokesman noted the figure of HK$26 billion for the final three months last year was a sharp 14.3 per cent plunge from the same period in 2018, marking the largest fall since 2003, when the city was hit by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). Hong Kong slips into recession: economy shrinks 3.2 per cent in third quarter 2019 31 Oct 2019 Hong Kong slips into recession: economy shrinks 3.2 per cent in third quarter 2019 31 Oct 2019 He said the ongoing anti-government protests, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, and “intensified violence” amid the civil unrest had caused severe disruption to the industry, warning of more uncertainty. “The food and beverage sector has been facing an even more difficult business environment recently due to the threat of the novel coronavirus. The outlook down the road depends critically on how this situation will evolve,” he said.  By Wednesday, there were more than 27,000 confirmed cases in mainland China, with the global death toll at more than 550. In Hong Kong, six new cases were reported over Tuesday and Wednesday, bringing the local tally to 21, including the city’s first fatality linked to the outbreak. Some of the recent cases reported had no travel history, signalling possible local transmission. David Leung Chi-wai, chairman of Seafood Delight Group, said some of its 12 restaurants registered a drop in revenue of between 50 to 70 per cent over the past 10 days, compared with normal figures.  “No districts in the city are spared from this,” he said. “Firms can’t earn enough to pay workers,” Leung added, noting that an industry group and some trade chambers had urged developers to roll out rent relief measures.  He said some businesses in the sector had closed their doors or shut down branches. Gordon Lam Sui-wa, who runs the 616 hotpot shop in Whampoa, said 15 outlets under the brand, which he partnered, had seen business decline after Lunar New Year. Lam said the restaurants in residential estates suffered a drop in revenue of 20 to 30 per cent from the same period last year, while sales figures at other outlets in busy districts such as Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, Tsim Sha Tsui and Causeway Bay plunged by more than 50 per cent. He said he opened a separate eatery in Tai Kok Tsui, but the business environment was quiet as firms nearby had resorted to allowing staff to work from home amid the coronavirus outbreak. “I can’t give a first quarter forecast, because the situation is changing daily. It really depends on whether the government can fully close the city’s borders,” he said, referring to calls for a complete shutdown of Hong Kong’s checkpoints with mainland China to stem the contagion. calls for a complete shutdown “Our revenues may slump further if all borders are closed and no visitors come, but if there is a widespread outbreak in the community, it’s hard to imagine what would happen ... Revenue may drop 80 to 90 per cent.” While restaurants weathered a decline, food delivery platform Foodpanda’s marketing head in Hong Kong Alex Law Ho-yin said the firm’s orders were three times that of last year during Lunar New Year.

The blast wrecked the toilet bowl and blackened walls after plumes of black smoke were emitted. The incident occurred at 10.47pm in a toilet for the disabled near Lai Chi Kok public library and Mei Foo Sun Chuen, a large private housing estate. The police’s Explosive Ordnance Disposal team was sent to the area to investigate. No one was hurt in the blast, according to the force, and no arrests were made. It was the third incident in a week involving either explosives or a bombing. On Sunday, two explosive devices were found at Lo Wu station, near the border with mainland China, affecting rail services for hours. two explosive devices  One of the devices was defused, while another caught fire and spurted white smoke.

Lisa Lau Man-man, who was part of a four-person group under the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) leading a fact-finding study, said she had worked to release its first report despite being “well aware” that there was an ongoing legal challenge. Lau stepped down on December 31 last year when her term expired after six years with the watchdog. She urged the IPCC to publish the report out of public interest, arguing there was no legal conflict. “The review has never stopped just because of the judicial challenge lodged,” Lau told the Post in a recent interview. Post Hong Kong police watchdog will not let experts comment on conduct report 18 Dec 2019 Hong Kong police watchdog will not let experts comment on conduct report 18 Dec 2019 In October, a legal challenge was lodged by social worker Hendrick Lui Chi-hang against the IPCC investigation, with the court allowing the bid in December. Lui had argued the watchdog did not have the power to conduct the probe. allowing the bid in December “The decision to wait for the judicial review is disappointing and not satisfactory. This gives the impression of stalling the matter over political reasons,” Lau said.  “I never thought the IPCC would use this reason to not publish a report … I would assume by not publishing, there will be nothing to talk about, or no pressure on police. But if the force has any wrongdoing, then admit it.” I never thought the IPCC would use this reason to not publish a report … But if the force has any wrongdoing, then admit it Lisa Lau, former IPCC member The IPCC was initially set to publish its first report by early February at the latest. The move was seen as an alternative put forth by city leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to calls for a commission of inquiry. Police have been accused of excessive force in their handling of protests, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. The movement, into its eighth month, has since morphed into a wider anti-government campaign, with violent clashes between protesters and officers.  In December, IPCC chairman Anthony Neoh and Lam told the media that the first interim report would be published early this year. Neoh mentioned on January 13 that the report would be pushed back to February because it was still being translated. 18 Oct 2019 18 Oct 2019 Three days later however, the IPCC governing council unanimously voted against the decision.  In a press statement, it said the High Court had allowed the case to come under legal scrutiny, and therefore the report’s release would be postponed. Other moderate liberal members of the IPCC such as Eric Cheung Tat-ming and Edwin Cheng Shing-lung have likewise questioned the move, saying the legal proceedings should not stop the watchdog from disclosing its report. The next hearing will be held on March 24 after the IPCC’s lawyer requested an expeditious arrangement, a legal source said. In her Post interview, Lau expressed her disappointment with the watchdog, quoting Neoh as having said to her that the interim report would be delivered before she stepped down. She added that the watchdog was the only mechanism by which an investigation could be launched. Post Lau said she personally supported protesters’ call for an independent judge-led inquiry, which the government had repeatedly rejected. “No one else is doing an investigation so the burden fell on the IPCC,” Lau said. “The public may not expect too much from the IPCC’s review, but now the only body investigating can’t even deliver … That will deal a blow to its credibility.” She said that throughout its review since July, the watchdog faced difficulty in its investigative power, as it could only receive information through the Complaints Against Police Office, under the force. Under current laws, the IPCC cannot meet witnesses, even if they are willing to do so. This presented a challenge for the watchdog to investigate some of the most contentious incidents throughout the months of unrest, according to Lau, such as the Yuen Long mob attack on July 21 in which white-clad men with wooden sticks and metal poles indiscriminately beat up protesters and commuters in an MTR station and train. ‘Unfair’ to burden IPCC with unrest probe without powers, former chief says 22 Jan 2020 ‘Unfair’ to burden IPCC with unrest probe without powers, former chief says 22 Jan 2020 Police faced a massive public backlash for taking 39 minutes to arrive on the scene, but the force has countered that its resources were stretched that night by violent protests in the city centre. Lau said the IPCC, in scrutinising the incident, could not meet witnesses or district councillors who had alerted police hours before.   “There are still holes in the sequence of events,” she said. “Without an independent body to investigate, we could not find out the truth … And this is beyond the IPCC.” She said more investigative power should be given to the watchdog to speed up its review, adding that the window to launch an independent inquiry and de-escalate conflict had already closed on the government. “The Yuen Long incident is like a scar on the force, and I don’t know how to rectify the situation,” she conceded. “I have great sympathy for frontline officers, given the doxxing and injuries to them. But this is also their job, and they need to control their temper and ensure that they only use appropriate force in their duties.” 	SCMP

Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which passed by nearly unanimous vote and became law in November Analysts said that given the law’s passage, the focus this year will be more on assuring its implementation than on new Hong Kong-related legislation. The human rights bill, passed over Beijing’s strong opposition and signed into law by Trump, apparently under political pressure from Republicans, requires that the administration issue a report annually on whether Hong Kong remains suitably autonomous from Beijing.

Kellogg said it would be a mistake for Beijing and the Hong Kong government to regard the current lull in protests in the city as a sign that the underlying dissatisfaction has disappeared. “Yes, they’re dealing with the coronavirus crisis, and perhaps that will distract people for a while. But the bottom line is that they still need to address the Hong Kong people’s anger,” Kellogg said. hey’re dealing with the coronavirus crisis “What the Trump administration should do is signal to Beijing that it needs to negotiate.

The attack happened at Yuen Long MTR station around 11pm when four of the victims were checking posters on a “Lennon Wall” in Long Yat Road, according to Yuen Long district councillor Ng Kin-wai. He said the other two victims were passers-by who tried to stop the attack. Ng, who knows some of the victims, said he rushed to the scene after learning about the incident. The victims claimed two of the attackers were armed with retractable batons, and some shouted “cockroach” while assaulting the victims, Ng said. Cockroach is an insult that has been aimed at anti-government protesters during the civil unrest.   An online video showed one woman being repeatedly punched after she fell to the floor in the attack. The gang of about 10 attackers fled in the direction of Nam Pin Wai Village before police arrived. Officers scouted the area, but no arrests were made.  According to police, four men and two women, aged between 16 and 42, were injured in the assault. Most of the victims suffered injuries to their arms and legs, while one suffered a head injury. All were taken to the area’s Pok Oi Hospital for treatment.  A 30-year-old woman had her HK$10,000 mobile phone stolen in the incident.  Lennon Walls have appeared around the city over the past six months, and are areas where messages of support for the anti-government movement are posted. 	SCMP

Under the expansion, the scheme will double the number of areas in the industry that can receive support, with more firms able to take advantage of fast-tracked visa entries.   Francis Fong Po-kiu, one of Hong Kong’s leading IT experts, suggested the government had got its priorities wrong, questioning why the scheme’s expansion was not delayed for several months in light of the challenges the city was weathering. “The virus outbreak is a public hygiene concern. I don't think people want to come to Hong Kong,” he said, also citing the negative images of long queues for masks compared with the organised distribution in Macau.  “The scheme comes at a very bad time because no one wants to visit.” He added that while he welcomed the scheme, it would have more benefits if it were expanded to different industries, with a wider net for different countries. In Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s policy address last year, the scheme was flagged as one element of focus for the government to boost international competitiveness.    Originally, companies based in Hong Kong’s two major innovation hubs, the Science Park and Cyberport, were permitted to use the scheme for hiring. Businesses that qualify have to come under any of the seven fields specified, such as biotechnology and artificial intelligence. With the expansion, eligibility has widened to any company conducting research and development in Hong Kong, with new categories such 5G communications, digital entertainment, green technology and the internet of things – a phrase used to describe the online connection of devices – among others. Kenny Shui, assistant research director at the Our Hong Kong Foundation, believed the expansion of TechTAS could help build a critical mass of technology talent in Hong Kong. “The scheme should also include professionals in technology-related fields, such as intellectual property protection and technology management, to help Hong Kong realise the potential of science and technology in different aspects,” he said. The coronavirus outbreak was an opportunity, he added. He said there was surging demand for technology applications, including biomedicine, big data and e-commerce. “The government needs to take a multipronged approach, such as supporting scientific collaboration and nurturing more talent.” Charles Mok, lawmaker for the IT sector, echoed digital veteran Fong’s views over the timing of the scheme, expressing doubt that anyone would want to come to Hong Kong under the current political climate and the spread of the deadly coronavirus. “It is not a good time to do anything except deal with the current problems,” he said. “Who would come to Hong Kong right now to work?” He added that on top of an already battered global image, the city was losing its IT professionals in a brain drain to Japan, Taiwan and Singapore at an unprecedented rate.

Times Higher Education Among 170 universities ranked worldwide, CityU topped the list, followed by the University of Hong Kong (HKU), while Chinese University (CUHK) was ranked fifth, just after Switzerland’s Ecole Polytechnique and ETH Zurich. The recognition comes when the local higher education institutions have been dragged into the city’s months-long anti-government protests. anti-government protests The universities have been ranked based on four equally weighted areas, including the proportion of international staff and students, authorship of publications with at least one international co-author, and their global standing. “Prospective students looking to study in the most international environments should apply to universities in Switzerland, Hong Kong, Singapore, or the UK,” the Times Higher Education said. Times Higher Education  Hong Kong’s universities saw off some of the best higher education institutions – such as the National University of Singapore, which came seventh jointly with the University of Oxford. The University of Cambridge was placed eighth.

CUHK has 6,000 students from more than 50 countries and has amassed 270 partnerships with institutions from 30 counties.  The rankings, however, did not make any reference to the ongoing protests in Hong Kong.

The protests, which were triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, have morphed into a wider campaign for more democracy and the creation of an independent inquiry commission to investigate police use of force during the demonstrations. Clashes between protesters and police have intensified over the past few months, with masked radicals hurling petrol bombs and bricks, and shooting officers with bows and arrows. Police have responded by firing more than 16,000 rounds of tear gas, 10,000 rounds of rubber bullets, 2,000 beanbag rounds, and 19 live rounds.  Ongoing anti-government protests have also led to the arrest of 7,143 people as of January 19. In its regional overview, Amnesty International described 2019 as a year “of repression, but also of resistance.”  “The Chinese government clamped down with renewed force on the freedoms promised to the people of Hong Kong under the terms of the handover of the territory in 1997. In the streets, those freedoms were doughtily defended against the steepest odds,” it said. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam rejects allegations of police brutality against protesters Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam rejects allegations of police brutality against protesters The report said protests and other efforts of civil society were successful in Hong Kong and some countries in the Asia-Pacific.  “As hard as it has become to resist, young people across the continent continue to take great risks and defy the established order,” it reads. The report dedicated two of its 25 chapters to Hong Kong and China, respectively. In the Hong Kong chapter, Amnesty International raised concern over Hongkongers’ freedom of peaceful assembly. “There was a rapid deterioration in the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, expression and association as the Hong Kong authorities increasingly adopted mainland China’s vague and all-encompassing definition of national security,” it said.   The international body accused the city’s police of responding to the protests with “unnecessary and excessive use of force”. “Amnesty International documented the police’s dangerous use of rubber bullets and beanbag rounds … and misuse of pepper spray and tear gas,” the report reads. “On 31 August, police started deploying water cannons, mixed with irritants and dye that indiscriminately marked individuals for identification later.” Under a subsection titled, “prisoners of conscience”, in the chapter, Amnesty International said nine leaders of the 2014 pro-democracy Occupy movement were convicted in April last year on “vague ‘public nuisance’-related charges”. The Hong Kong government and the police force have yet to respond to the report. 	SCMP

The threat followed petrol bomb attacks on four police stations and a patrol car within 24 hours in a new wave of action over the government’s failure to close the city’s border and supply protective gear in response to the Wuhan virus. “They vent their anger on the force because they treat the force as the government’s fighters,” one source said.

The petrol bomb attacks began shortly before 5am on Wednesday when four black-clad attackers hurled petrol bombs at Tin Shui Wai Police Station. About 15 hours later, at least three petrol bombs were hurled at Kwai Chung Police Station.  At 11pm that night, at least two petrol bombs were hurled at a police vehicle when it passed through the junction of Nathan Road and Nelson Street in Mong Kok.  Shortly after 2am on Thursday, three black-clad attackers hurled seven petrol bombs at the Hung Hom Police Station in Princess Margaret Road, Ho Man Tin. ‘More dangerous’ petrol bomb recipes online spark fire service warning 7 Oct 2019 ‘More dangerous’ petrol bomb recipes online spark fire service warning 7 Oct 2019  Police said no one was injured in the five attacks.

On Monday, a home-made bomb went off in a men’s toilet cubicle at the Caritas Medical Centre in Cheung Sha Wan at about 2.30am. A message on Telegram said the Cheung Sha Wan attack was “just a warning” and “there will be more real bombs to come”, as closing Hong Kong’s borders was the only way to prevent the coronavirus outbreak from worsening in the city.

The organised crime and triad bureau, which has been handling serious cases arising from more than seven months of protests sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, denied charges it had been making arbitrary arrests. seven months of protests Its deputy head, Senior Superintendent Steve Li Kwai-wah, said identifying suspects and gathering evidence for prosecution was challenging and time-consuming, but arrests were made on the spot only when officers were satisfied the law had been broken. He also said the force was taken aback by the increasing number of young people being arrested, as they risked going to jail for venting their anger in an unlawful way. Clashes, escapes and arrests as stand-off continues at Hong Kong Polytechnic University Clashes, escapes and arrests as stand-off continues at Hong Kong Polytechnic University Ongoing anti-government protests led to the arrest of 7,143 people as of January 19, the youngest aged 11. According to the bureau, two in five of those arrested were students, with 1,170 still in secondary school. Li said the bureau had handled 75 protest-related cases – its heaviest workload ever. They include 26 cases of rioting, eight of possession of offensive weapons, six related to explosives and three of possession of firearms.  “Our office has arrested 1,048 individuals so far and we have around 300 targets who are at large. I hope to arrest them soon. Investigations are under way,” Li told the Post. Apart from the 300 suspects, the Post reported this week that more than 80 radical protesters suspected of hurling petrol bombs during anti-government protests, storming the city’s legislature and assaulting opponents had fled to Taiwan. Post  But police sources said as there was no extradition agreement between the two places, there was nothing more police could do unless they returned voluntarily to Hong Kong. ‘Even white miniskirts are banned’: mainland China stops imports over protests 28 Jan 2020 ‘Even white miniskirts are banned’: mainland China stops imports over protests 28 Jan 2020 Of the 7,143 people arrested, the police charged 1,106, or 15 per cent. The courts have convicted 41 individuals, with sentences of up to 14 months in jail.  Conceding that prosecution figures “do not seem impressive”, Li said investigations soaked up time and manpower, as officers sieved through massive amounts of video clips to find evidence. Since the protests began last June, masked radicals have besieged roads, wrecked traffic lights and set fires on streets, vandalised MTR stations, businesses and banks, and occupied universities. Groups have attacked police officers on the front line, hurling petrol bombs and bricks, and shooting at them with bows and arrows. Police have responded by firing more than 16,000 rounds of tear gas, 10,000 rounds of rubber bullets, 2,000 beanbag rounds, and 19 live rounds. Li expressed sadness at the surge in the number of young students arrested, especially since the school year began in September. The 2,623 students arrested since then were almost 10 times the 279 nabbed between June and August. The veteran investigator said he used to feel excited each time he arrested a suspect behind a nasty crime, believing he helped to make society a better place. But arresting youngsters left him feeling sad, as he found from speaking to them that they were “just kids”.

To a certain extent, their creativity is a talent, but why use it to break the law?” Li said repeated allegations that arrested individuals had been subjected to sexual violence by the police had also had an effect. “An arrested girl asked me why l had not been sexually violent towards her,” he said. “I explained our work to her. But I am certainly not the first in the force to be asked that question.”   Responding to accusations of arbitrary arrests, Li said it was reasonable for officers to assume that a person might have broken the law if they were found in the centre of an unlawful assembly. “We look at all the evidence during our investigations. A shopper might have a receipt or newly bought products with them. Or the security camera might show them leaving the mall,” he said. “But merely claiming to be residents in an area does not mean people can join an unlawful assembly. If they refused to leave the spot despite repeated warnings, we have the grounds to make an arrest.” 	SCMP

With more than 7,000 people arrested so far, the youngest just 11 years old, the lawmaker said those accused of relatively minor offences could be dealt with more leniently. “An unconditional amnesty is impossible, but special treatment or a lenient sentence – subject to conditions appropriate for those charged for minor offences – is possible,” said Leung, a member of the Basic Law Committee, which advises China’s top legislative body on issues relating to Hong Kong’s mini-constitution. She joined other pro-establishment heavyweights in asking Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to expand the remit of a proposed independent review committee to include recommending how to deal with those arrested. independent review committee to include recommending how to deal with those arrested. Lam has rejected protesters’ demand for an independent commission of inquiry, preferring to have an independent review committee look into the political and socio-economic causes of the city’s deep-seated problems. Protesters have also demanded amnesty for those arrested, but the city leader rejected that too, saying pardoning those accused of assault, arson and unlawful assembly would undermine the rule of law.

More details about the committee, which Lam said would be similar to the one set up by the British government after the 2011 London riots, are expected in February. Leung, a law professor at City University in Hong Kong, said the government ought to “make better use of the review committee”.  “Studying only the distant causes of the crisis is not really helpful,” she told the Post. “What we need are some practical and forward-looking solutions. Post “The committee can serve as a platform for reconciliation and rehabilitation.

She said the Riots, Communities and Victims Panel set up after the London riots of 2011 recommended lenient treatment for minor cases.  Leung is not the first from the pro-Beijing camp to propose special treatment for protesters arrested for relatively minor offences. Last November, former Legislative Council president Jasper Tsang Yok-sing suggested pardoning some of those who committed less serious crimes. Lawyer Anna Wu Hung-yuk, chairwoman of the Competition Commission and a former executive councillor, has also come out in support of amnesty for some of those arrested and police officers who may have breached the law, as well as an independent inquiry. She said offering amnesty and applying discretion in the prosecution of cases have always been part of Hong Kong’s legal system. “The question is, when do we exercise it. That step has to be thought through, because I don’t believe in a peace-building process that does not include a component to deal with rifts, and these rifts are very deep,” Wu said at a University of Hong Kong forum last Tuesday. The question is, when do we exercise it. That step has to be thought through, because I don’t believe in a peace-building process that does not include a component to deal with rifts Anna Wu, Competition Commission chairwoman She took issue with the Hong Kong government appearing to tell Hongkongers that there is rule of law only if they obey the law. “I think that’s a very narrow sense of the law,” she said. “Compliance with the law and enforcement of the law then become excuses for the government [not to act].” Anna Dziedzic, associate director of HKU’s Centre for Comparative and Public Law, said amnesty can take several forms, including allowing the secretary for justice to use discretion. “This is a reset button in trying to de-escalate some of the civil unrest. [It means saying,] ‘Okay, we’ve heard you, and let’s draw a line under that and start talking properly and peacefully’,” she said. Dziedzic said the review committee could suggest the scope of the amnesty process, and specific legislation to allow for pardons could also be made part of the legal system. Although amnesty in some jurisdictions covers those who commit violent acts, she said Hong Kong could “compromise” and draw a line that would satisfy both protesters and police. “Individual harm to a person could acceptably be excluded from an amnesty, because it’s a very serious offence and you can’t really justify that to promote the cause,” she said. Individual harm to a person could acceptably be excluded from an amnesty, because it’s a very serious offence Anna Dziedzic, Centre for Comparative and Public Law HKU criminal law professor Simon Young suggested that police exercise greater discretion before charging underaged persons accused of relatively minor offences.

He thought it would help to not charge such young offenders, though they could still be supervised for a period. Pro-establishment lawmaker Ann Chiang Lai-wan said she believed the government had already taken a lenient approach towards protesters, pointing out that a large proportion of those arrested so far had not been charged. “There are cases of inadequate evidence, but I think police and the Department of Justice are trying to let go of those committing only minor offences,” she said. I think police and the Department of Justice are trying to let go of those committing only minor offences Ann Chiang, lawmaker A source close to the city’s top officials said that with anti-government protests still going on, pardons for those arrested could only happen “without publicly mentioning it”. Otherwise, he added, people might wrongly believe that violence was condoned by the government and worked as a method of protesting. . 	SCMP

Police said they had detained 17 people on suspicion of possession of offensive weapons and other items meant for unlawful use. “The force made deployments in different places in advance, so there were no serious traffic disruptions,” a spokesman said. The police Facebook page showed a video of four black-clad protesters smashing the windscreen of a bus near Lion Rock Tunnel in Sha Tin, forcing the vehicle to stop. The force also said a petrol bomb was thrown into the police station in Tin Shui Wai. Attempts to block roads or rail were also made in Yuen Long, Tai Po, Sheung Shui and Sai Wan Ho. A second protest, planned for lunch time, in Central, only attracted about 10 black-clad people marching in the IFC mall, chanting “five demands, not one less”, and singing the protest anthem Glory to Hong Kong.
