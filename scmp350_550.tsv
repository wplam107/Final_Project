Senior Superintendent Wong Wai-shun on Monday announced traffic would be blocked only on Kowloon Park Drive in Tsim Sha Tsui – a neighbourhood famous for its neon light displays and decorations – on Christmas Eve. The announcement deviates from the long-established tradition in which police officers seal off almost the entire district, from the south of Salisbury Road to a large portion of Nathan Road to the north, for revellers to walk around. But in recent months the shopping hub has been badly hit by the anti-government protests, which are now in their seventh month. Wong said the force considered the arrangement to be appropriate after a full assessment of the intelligence it had gathered. “More problems could arise if we block the roads,” he said, but added that police would make adjustments according to the situation on the ground on Tuesday.  Many roads commonly used by the festive crowd at this time of the year were earlier turned into protest battlegrounds. Shopping malls and arcades were caught up in clashes between protesters and police. Christmas cards for arrested and injured at Hong Kong lunchtime protests Christmas cards for arrested and injured at Hong Kong lunchtime protests Many radicals also vandalised business establishments with ties to mainland China. Police had initially approved Tuesday’s march from Salisbury Road to Hung Hom between 6pm and 10pm. But the organising group later cancelled the application as police refused its request to hold the march between 8pm and 1am. Police also refused to allow the march to end on Nathan Road.  But despite the police decisions, calls continue to emerge online urging people to show up for the protest. Wong warned on Monday that those who turned up would risk being arrested for taking part in an unlawful assembly. He also said police would enforce the law stringently in the face of any violent acts. Incoming district councillor Chu Tsz-lok, who will assume office in January in his Tsim Sha Tsui East seat, said some police measures adopted in recent months to curb protests had already infuriated local residents. “If local residents are so angry, how can revellers feel otherwise?” he asked.  Several roads on Hong Kong Island, including East Point Road in Causeway Bay and Queen’s Road, will also remain blocked on Tuesday to enhance security. ‘Christmas shopping’ protests in malls lead to vandalism of outlets and clashes 16 Dec 2019 ‘Christmas shopping’ protests in malls lead to vandalism of outlets and clashes 16 Dec 2019 On Monday, Citizens’ Press Conference, a self-styled representative group of the protesters, called on people to “take to the streets” on Christmas Eve and on the following day to “celebrate”. Denying that they were trying to stir up trouble, a spokesman for the group said: “It is only natural for people to go out to celebrate. I just hope police do not intervene. Tear gas has no place in [a] festival.” But he refused to elaborate on the group’s plans. As in the past, the representatives of the group wore masks and black clothes while speaking to journalists on Monday. Many others also issued calls on the internet to take part in afternoon marches during Christmas and Boxing Day across Hong Kong.

But, he did not specify who should have taken the initiative, and said there was a need for “more manners and less provocation”. He also defended another police officer’s decision to draw his gun at a crowd in Central on Sunday.

Five young Hong Kong civil servants have been recommended by Beijing to take up positions in the United Nations from next month, in a move seen as a softer approach by the central government to embrace the city’s youth and give them global exposure amid the ongoing social unrest. The announcement on Monday marked the first time that mainland Chinese authorities have worked with Hong Kong officials to allow the city’s civil servants to join the UN Junior Professional Officer Programme, set up in 1963. The group, selected from a range of agencies, will be seconded to work at the UN’s New York headquarters and offices in Geneva and Vienna for two years. At a ceremony to announce the move, Beijing’s top diplomat in Hong Kong signalled a different approach to the protests, which are now into their seventh month. Xie Feng, commissioner of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs office, said that radical protesters were only in the minority and did not represent the entire younger generation in the city. only in the minority “Some young people have lost themselves by taking part in street violence and illegal activities, vandalising, setting fires and assaulting police or citizens, as well as desecrating the national flag and waving foreign ones or begging for outside intervention,” he added. “We feel angry and disheartened at these incidents, but I still believe that the black-clad rioters are only a minority, and they do not represent the youth of Hong Kong.”  The unrest was sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no such agreement, including mainland China. Protesters have insisted on five demands, including a judge-led independent inquiry into police conduct over the handling of protests, and amnesty to those arrested. But the government has stood firm.  News of the selection on Monday came after President Xi Jinping said in Macau last week that patriotism in the casino hub was the most important reason for the success of the “one country, two systems” principle. Xi was there to mark the 20th anniversary of Macau’s handover to Chinese administration. Macau patriotism in the casino hub The Chinese leader also praised Macau’s education system, saying that national identity had been inculcated in young people there.  In October, diplomat Xie launched a scathing attack on Hong Kong’s protest movement, describing the street violence as a “virus” deadlier than the one that had caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003. More than 6,000 people have been arrested since June, and nearly 40 per cent of them are students. Hong Kong’s young people have inherited from their seniors the fine tradition of loving both the country and their city Xie Feng, commissioner of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs office But on Monday, in a renewed show of faith in the city’s youth, Xie said that in the five Hong Kong civil servants selected for the UN programme, he saw the “fine qualities” that most in their class possessed. that in the five Hong Kong civil servants selected for the UN programme, he saw the “fine qualities” that most in their class possessed. “Hong Kong’s young people have inherited from their seniors the fine tradition of loving both the country and their city. Their Lion Rock spirit of fighting for their dreams represent hope for Hong Kong … to start again,” Xie added. The term “Lion Rock spirit” comes from a popular 1970s television series and is commonly used to refer to the resilience and diligence of locals. Xie said patriotism was a universal core value and that those who did not love their country would never earn the respect of others. He urged Hong Kong youth to defend the “one country, two systems” policy under which the city is granted a high degree of autonomy, and called on them to say no to separatism. Xie’s comments came after a recent poll published by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute showed a record-high 78 per cent of 577 respondents identified as “Hongkongers”. Those who regarded themselves as “Chinese” hit a low of 21 per cent. Why are the young people of Hong Kong angry and deeply unhappy? 12 Jul 2019 Why are the young people of Hong Kong angry and deeply unhappy? 12 Jul 2019 Speaking at the same event, Hong Kong leader Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said her administration wanted young people to have a sense of national identity. The five selected Hong Kong civil servants, by working in the UN, would be able to share the glory from China’s rising international status, she added. Political commentator Johnny Lau Yui-siu said Beijing had adopted this “soft sell” approach to win over the hearts of Hong Kong youth as it made strategic adjustments amid the months-long protests. He said he expected this stance to continue but added that he doubted it would douse the flames of the unrest as those taking to the streets were not beneficiaries of such programmes. The five are Wilson Lai, senior investigator from the Independent Commission Against Corruption; He Yuheng, an Observatory scientific officer; Francis Yuen, electronics engineer from the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department; Jo Chan, another engineer from the department; and Gabriel Pak, an administrative officer. Chan said Beijing had shown it valued the development of young people in Hong Kong by selecting them to the programme, while Lai said he hoped to bring back knowledge gained from the programme. A source said there were no open applications among civil servants to apply to be picked by Beijing. According to the UN website, the main objective of the JPO programme is to provide young professionals the chance for a hands-on experience in the field of multilateral international cooperation. In 2003, Margaret Chan Fung Fu-chun, then Hong Kong’s director of health, quit her job to become the World Health Organisation’s director of protection of the human environment. Three years later, she was appointed to WHO director general and served until 2012. 	SCMP

Officers from police’s public relations unit contradict each other on pesky issue	A member of Hong Kong police’s public relations unit has said the use of the word “cockroach” by officers to describe anti-government protesters should not be over-interpreted as it could actually be a compliment – a claim later contradicted by his senior who admitted the term was “not ideal”. Speaking on the RTHK programme “Hong Kong Connection” on Monday, Chief Inspector Tam Yu-hei was referring to insults traded between police and demonstrators in the months-long social unrest roiling the city. “Aren’t cockroaches full of vitality and can survive in times of difficulties?” Tam argued. He also cited the term “dog” used by protesters on officers. “We may see it as police being loyal and obedient,” Tam said, concluding that his colleagues in the force were very professional and had vowed not to be hostile towards anyone. ‘Cockroach’ – where does the derogatory term come from? ‘Cockroach’ – where does the derogatory term come from? 10 Dec 2019 However, at a regular press briefing on the same day, Superintendent Kwok Ka-chuen, Tam’s senior from the Police Public Relations Branch, conceded: “It is not ideal to label a group of people as cockroaches,” echoing earlier views from the police top brass. Kwok Ka-chuen , conceded: “It is not ideal to label a group of people as cockroaches,” echoing earlier views from the police top brass. “Tensions have risen between police and protesters in the last few months ... We hope members of the force can control their emotions in the field,” he said. In July, the Junior Police Officers’ Association, a union representing many frontline officers, started referring to protesters in its official statements as “cockroaches”. Asked in August about the matter, Superintendent Kong Wing-cheung from the PPRB had said such language was “not ideal”, but added that all parties were “under a lot of stress”.   Hong Kong police officers said they would ‘celebrate student’s death’ 24 Dec 2019 Hong Kong police officers said they would ‘celebrate student’s death’ 24 Dec 2019 The PPRB had responded to multiple media inquiries over the past months, insisting that such language was not appropriate. On Monday’s TV programme, Tam also noted that more than 3,000 officers had been doxxed since the protests erupted in June, adding that it was very frustrating that people were targeting officers’ families to express their discontent with the force.  He said, however, that he did not agree with the actions of officers who refused to show their warrant cards, as this made it difficult for the public to file complaints.  Tam said he looked forward to hearing people’s feedback regarding his comments on the show. Additional reporting by Kathleen Magramo Additional reporting by Kathleen Magramo 	SCMP

The plea for peace came as legal scholars at a top local university suggested granting amnesty to alleged offenders on both sides of the divide – including protesters, their opponents and the police. In a Christmas message issued on Monday, Cardinal John Tong Hon, apostolic administrator of Hong Kong, described the recent unrest as “socio-political turmoil”, and appealed to all city residents to refrain from violence during the holidays. “As we approach Christmas, we earnestly appeal to all people to stop acts of violence. Let us have a cooling-off period for an in-depth reflection on our social turmoil and find a way to resolve the current impasse in a humane manner, restoring peace with healing of body, mind and spirit,” the message read. Hong Kong has been rocked since early June by anti-government protests, sparked by an unpopular extradition bill, which has since been withdrawn. Demonstrators have frequently held rallies and occupied roads, leading to many clashes with police, who have used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon, in the face of hurled bricks and petrol bombs, among other projectiles. Tong once again called on the government to heed public demands for an independent inquiry into the violent confrontations, saying that could “help to re-establish mutual trust between the government and the people and pave the way for a dialogue of reconciliation.”  Tong is not the first religious leader in the city to urge festive calm. In a separate Christmas message last Saturday, the archbishop of Hong Kong’s Anglican Church, Most Reverend Paul Kwong, urged the government and protesters to take the holiday as an opportunity to “start a dialogue with courage, sincerity and humility, and to admit their own inadequacies and shortcomings”. “The government should not limit themselves to rigid thinking when they respond to voices from society, but should instead take practical measures or actions that are relevant to the needs of the citizens,” Kwong said. Police gun drawn as Hong Kong rally for China’s Uygurs descends into chaos Police gun drawn as Hong Kong rally for China’s Uygurs descends into chaos About 30 of Hong Kong’s 82 Catholic churches will bring forward their traditional Christmas midnight masses to 9pm or earlier on Christmas Eve, amid online calls for protests on Tuesday.  Reverend Dominic Chan Chi-ming of the Hong Kong Catholic Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception told local media the arrangement was a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of the faithful in view of the unstable social situation.  Meanwhile, a paper published by the Centre for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong on Monday suggested granting amnesty to the more than 6,000 people arrested during the protests, to ease political tension and build trust between the public and the government. Radical protesters do not represent Hong Kong youth, Beijing envoy says 23 Dec 2019 Radical protesters do not represent Hong Kong youth, Beijing envoy says 23 Dec 2019 “Amnesty, far from being inconsistent with the rule of law and virtuous governance, can, in principle, support those values,” the paper read. It suggested amnesty could be considered for all, including protesters, their opponents and police, but added that factors such as their age, the seriousness of their alleged offence and whether they held public office should be taken into account. Amnesty could be considered for young offenders who sought to advocate political change and committed less serious crimes such as painting graffiti, it added, saying offenders in serious cases such as murders and assaults, or those holding public office, might be less worthy of consideration. Instead of immunity, the centre said amnesties could take the form of pardons, conditional releases or reduced penalties. 	SCMP

On average, 77.9 per cent of respondents had received tertiary education.  On Monday, Xie, who was speaking at a public event, said patriotism was a universal core value and urged the city’s youth to embrace opportunities brought on by China’s rise on the global stage.  “Look at the five continents, you will see so many countries have welcomed China as the No 1 economic engine, and are longing for the Belt and Road Initiative for the public good. Countries are supporting China in playing a more prominent role in global governance, and many are agreeable to China’s win-win approach to cooperation and building communities with a shared interest,” Xie said.

From January to June next year, travel agencies will receive a HK$100 subsidy per tourist for each trip to a bunch of shortlisted “green tourist spots”, which include country parks and the Geopark in Sai Kung, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau Tang-wah announced on Monday. The maximum subsidy a travel agent can receive has been capped at HK$50,000. Officials hoped the scheme, aimed to attract local residents, would promote “green tourism”, although environmental pressure groups and some tour operators said the government was “rushing through” the scheme without carefully considering its environmental impacts. “There has been suggestions that while we are having a tough time attracting tourists to the city, we should open up our precious green spots – including country parks which occupy more than 40 per cent of our territory – to Hong Kong people,” Yau said. Tourist arrivals to the city suffered a 56 per cent year-on-year drop in November, a trend which Yau said continued in early December as well.  According to the Immigration Department, the number of inbound visitors dropped 28.4 per cent to about 367,300 on December 22 this year from the same day last year. Hong Kong’s tourism sector reels amid months of protests, disruptions 26 Oct 2019 Hong Kong’s tourism sector reels amid months of protests, disruptions 26 Oct 2019 But Yau hoped the situation would improve, at least locally, with the introduction of the scheme. Hong Kong’s tourism industry has been hit hard by anti-government protests over the past six months, with peaceful demonstrations often turning into violent battles between protesters and police at railway stations, university campuses, shopping malls, tourist spots, and even residential areas. More than 40 jurisdictions around the world have issued advisories to their people against travelling to the city.  Yau dismissed concerns over possible adverse environmental impacts if more tourists flocked to the country parks or outlying islands. He said more than 12 million people visit the country parks every year and the parks had the capacity to handle more footfall.  Acting environment minister Tse Chin-wan said travel agents should observe guidelines – such as reducing the use of disposable materials – to protect the environment while taking tourists to the eco-tourism spots. Jason Wong Chun-tat, chairman of the Hong Kong Travel Industry Council, hoped travel agents would lower the fees for such tours following the government’s announcement of subsidy. At present, travel agents charge anything between HK$100 to a few hundred dollars per person per tour. However, a section of tour operators criticised the government for “rushing through” the scheme and “deviating from the original mission of green tourism”. Paul Chan Chi-yuen, founder of Walk in Hong Kong, said most travel agents lacked any interest or experience in organising eco-tours. Sharp drop in foreign visitors keen to spot Hong Kong’s endangered pink dolphins 13 Oct 2019 Sharp drop in foreign visitors keen to spot Hong Kong’s endangered pink dolphins 13 Oct 2019 “The government is using money to create an interest in green tours, but it will not work,” Chan said. As part of the latest scheme, to be eligible for the subsidy, travel agents are required to hire transporters and caterers, apart from local tour guides, for tourists. “But the whole point of green tourism is to promote low-carbon-footprint and low-consumption travelling. Are we going to achieve that?” Chan said. Hahn Chu Hon-keung, director of environmental advocacy at Green Earth, also said the government should first carefully assess the capacity of the country parks. “We welcome the government’s initiative to promote eco-tourism. But the execution of the plan seems to have been rushed through,” Chu said. “This makes one wonder: is it just to give out money to support the tourism industry amid the ongoing slump?” Chu added more efforts were needed to train tour guides to eventually enhance the public’s understanding of conservation. Lukewarm response to finance scheme Lukewarm response to finance scheme Meanwhile, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have been slow in signing up for the government’s scheme to borrow loans from banks. In the first week since the launch of a new arrangement under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme, five major banks have received only 30 applications. Of these, only 10 applications were referred to Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC) following vetting, with five applications already approved, Raymond Li Ling-cheung, the HKMC’s chief executive officer, said. Hong Kong Mortgage Corp keen to encourage more SME loans 20 Jul 2018 Hong Kong Mortgage Corp keen to encourage more SME loans 20 Jul 2018 As part of the scheme, the government provides a 90 per cent guarantee for loans of up to HK$6 million and with a repayment period of five years, to boost the enterprises amid economic downturn. Danny Lau Tat-pong, honorary chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association, said merely 3 per cent of members managed to receive funding from the government's separate loans support arrangement, a similar scheme which was rolled out in 2008 to provide 80 per cent guarantee. Although the HKMC pledged to complete the vetting process within three days of getting referrals from banks, Lau said companies generally took two weeks for the same work. He urged for relaxing restrictions for applicants to the scheme from sectors – such as food and beverage, retail, and tourism – where businesses had been more seriously affected. But Li and Yau insisted the initial feedbacks were positive to help SMEs to improve their cash flows. Li said banks would need some time to go through the applicants’ statements and cash flow performance, but added the process had been streamlined and companies had been saved from submitting full financial statements during application.

The war of words follows written requests from Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice and Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) for evidence to facilitate the self-ruled island’s investigation into a robbery by a Taiwanese citizen. The accused, surnamed Lin, is alleged to have threatened a worker at a watch shop in Hong Kong’s Tsim Sha Tsui district with an air pistol before making off with two watches valued a total of HK$990,000 (US$126,000) in October. He returned to Taiwan later that day where he was arrested. Taiwan police arrest man over Hong Kong watch robbery 14 Nov 2019 Taiwan police arrest man over Hong Kong watch robbery 14 Nov 2019 The 30-year-old man is suspected of being a serial offender who has been linked to a series of robberies across Southeast Asia and Taiwanese police have asked the local prosecutors’ office to detain him. Under Taiwanese law, suspects in robberies committed in Hong Kong and Macau can be tried in Taiwan’s courts and, if found guilty, face up to three years in jail. However, there is no extradition law or judicial cooperation agreement between Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan – a loophole that has proved highly contentious.  The Taiwanese ministry called on the Hong Kong government to provide evidence, including video footage and a witness statement, to aid the investigation in Taiwan. The Hong Kong Security Bureau said there was no law relating to mutual legal assistance or the turning over of fugitives between the two jurisdictions, but that the city was ready to receive the suspect without restrictions if he turned himself in to the Hong Kong authorities. Taiwanese president Tsai denies ‘using’ Hong Kong protests for election 10 Dec 2019 Taiwanese president Tsai denies ‘using’ Hong Kong protests for election 10 Dec 2019 On Sunday afternoon, the MAC said no responsible government that took note of the rule of law and safety of the public would allow a suspect involved in a serious crime to turn himself in without a police escort. Hong Kong would become known as a haven for criminals, it said. In a late-night statement on Sunday, the ministry also accused the Hong Kong government of failing to uphold justice by refusing to provide assistance in the case. In a late-night statement on Sunday, the ministry also accused the Hong Kong government of failing to uphold justice by refusing to provide assistance in the case. Both statements also referred explicitly to the murder case that led to the Hong Kong government’s failed attempt to introduce an extradition bill in June 2019, triggering the city’s biggest political crisis since its return to China in 1997. murder case    Chan, a Hong Kong citizen, was suspected of killing his pregnant girlfriend Poon Hiu-wing during a holiday in Taiwan in February last year. He returned to Hong Kong soon after the murder, and was subsequently jailed for a related money-laundering offence. Murder suspect who triggered Hong Kong’s protest crisis issues apology as he leaves prison Murder suspect who triggered Hong Kong’s protest crisis issues apology as he leaves prison In an attempt to close the loophole that prevented Chan’s extradition to Taiwan, the Hong Kong government introduced a bill that would also have allowed extraditions to mainland China. The bill was subsequently withdrawn after protests in the city which have since broadened to include other demands, including universal suffrage. Just before Chan’s release in October, the Hong Kong government was told he wished to turn himself in to Taiwanese authorities. The administration then contacted Taipei to arrange Chan’s surrender, but the two sides failed to agree on how that should take place. Hong Kong officials insisted Chan could freely surrender himself, but Taiwan said they should not allow a suspect to walk free because of the risk of destruction or tampering with evidence. In its statement on Sunday night, the Hong Kong government said authorities had already provided the necessary information in the robbery case under the permissible system of the liaison channel between Hong Kong and Taiwan police. “Taiwanese authorities should stop using politics or the pretext of Chan Tong-kai and the robbery to meddle with the rule of law and release statements that go against the law in Hong Kong,” the statement said. In a response to reporters’ questions, the Hong Kong Security Bureau on Monday night said that the city government had always been willing to work with other jurisdictions under the principle of mutual respect. The bureau said that – even though no extradition agreement or agreement of mutual legal assistance between Hong Kong and Taiwan – Hong Kong had still given Taiwan materials that are allowed under the existing mechanism. It was “regrettable” that the Taiwan government had made “irresponsible comments” about Hong Kong, a bureau spokesman said, adding that the Hong Kong government cannot accept the Taiwan authorities for “disrespecting” Hong Kong’s law.

As the anti-government demonstrations rolled into their seventh month, officials uncovered two record cases – a HK$245 million shipment of the terrorist drug “chemical courage” from Syria to Saudi Arabia via Hong Kong in November, and a HK$77 million crystal meth haul in cargo airmailed from Mexico to Hong Kong via Alaska this month. HK$245 million shipment of the terrorist drug HK$77 million crystal meth The circuitous routing in both cases had caught the attention of authorities. The amount of ketamine netted, mostly trafficked by air, also jumped 19-fold to 307.5kg – the largest surge among all types of drug, as the Customs and Excise Department warned of a smuggling spike to meet festive demand. “We do not exclude the possibility that drug syndicates operated on the assumption that law enforcers in Hong Kong are busy because of the social unrest. Officers could have relaxed interceptions and investigations as manpower is stretched,” Superintendent Barry Chu Yin-min of the Customs Drug Investigation Bureau said in an interview.  “But we had actually stepped up enforcement by engaging in more intelligence exchanges and risk assessments. Especially during this tough period in Hong Kong, we must better guard our borders.” Overall, customs seized a total of 1.9 tonnes of drugs in 739 cases between January and November, with a market value of HK$930 million, compared with HK$390 million in the same period last year. CORONAVIRUS UPDATE Get updates direct to your inbox SUBSCRIBE There was a 57 per cent surge in the total quantity of drugs seized, although the number of cases fell by 10 per cent.  As for police, the force seized HK$940 million worth of drugs, including 653kg of cocaine, from January to November, meaning a total value of HK$1.87 billion for the drugs uncovered by both enforcement agencies, compared with HK$1.07 billion in the same period of 2018. Last month, customs found 1.57 million fenethylline tablets in a container filled with furniture being shipped to Saudi Arabia from Syria, via Hong Kong and mainland China. It was the first time authorities had foiled a smuggling attempt involving the drug.  The pills contained the active ingredient amphetamine, reported to be widely used among Isis militants. Police seize 75kg of cocaine worth US$11.5 million from gang 7 Dec 2019 Police seize 75kg of cocaine worth US$11.5 million from gang 7 Dec 2019 In the latest 110kg haul of crystal meth, also known as Ice, the largest seizure of its kind since 2010, the consignment was declared as plastic resin, which raised suspicions because the material is rarely imported from Mexico and is costly to deliver. “Traffickers think that Hong Kong, as a financial and logistics hub, is more convenient for them to transship contraband items,” Chu said. However, he dismissed the idea of the city being used as a drug smuggling route, despite the surge in seizures. “You might think the drug situation in Hong Kong is serious as you only focus on our home city,” he said. “The drug problem is global. Other countries may net 10 times more than what we uncover.” According to the UN’s Office on Drugs and Crime, Australian law enforcers netted 4.1 tonnes of cocaine and 5.6 tonnes of Ice in 2017. The drugs seized by Hong Kong customs also included nearly 586kg of cocaine and 222kg of cannabis, representing increases of 164 per cent and 66 per cent respectively, year on year. The batches were for the local market and transshipments. Chu said ketamine, a drug popular among local users more than a decade ago, was undergoing a resurgence because of an upgrade in quality. “The new version of ketamine is in the form of crystal sugar instead of powder, and has better quality. The market price is also around seven times more than before,” Chu said. “More ketamine has been airmailed into Hong Kong lately from Europe and Southeast Asia, with the amount surging particularly since October. They may be rushing to meet festive demand.” Earlier this month, two 25-year-old men arriving from South Africa were arrested and later charged after they were found carrying HK$30 million worth of suspected cocaine in their suitcase with the haul wrapped as Christmas gifts. Chu added that latest equipment upgrades for the authorities also boosted efficiency in detection as the newly introduced handheld narcotics analyser allowed officers to scan and spot drugs placed in objects without having to unwrap parcels.

US-China trade war In an exclusive interview with the Post, Executive Council convenor Bernard Chan said complex geopolitical issues, including next month’s presidential election in Taiwan, would influence Hong Kong’s immediate economic future. Post How can Hong Kong's economy bounce back in 2020? How can Hong Kong's economy bounce back in 2020? Speaking in the same interview, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau Tang-wah said he could see “two cyclones” hitting the city in the unrest at home and the trade war abroad, which had combined to knock 3 per cent off the city’s gross domestic product. “We are bad, but that is not the end of the world,” Yau said. “One may say we are not yet out of the woods. I can see these two cyclones hitting us – one is the trade war which is easing at least, but the local unrest, we need to tackle it by ourselves; the Hong Kong government and the wider community.” local unrest The anti-government protests that have swept the city since June, combined with the trade war and the passing of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act in Washington in November have created an unprecedented sense of unease. President Xi Jinping has called the situation the most critical and complicated since Hong Kong returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act  When Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor travelled to Beijing for her annual duty visit last week, Premier Li Keqiang told her she had to stop the violent protests, and address the deep-rooted conflicts and problems in the city’s socio-economic development. Chan acknowledged there were several issues that needed to be resolved, not least over housing and the disparity between rich and poor in the city.  “After six months’ unrest, obviously we have a structural issue we need to address,” Chan said. “These are so-called deep-rooted issues that were not dealt with – disparity of housing and affordability.” I hope people will look at the bigger picture of Hong Kong, even if we don’t agree with each other Executive Council convenor Bernard Chan The Exco convenor said Lam’s administration also had to address issues surrounding economic and social integration with China.  Latest government statistics showed more than 1.4 million Hongkongers, or one in every five people, were living below the poverty line last year, the highest number in a decade. or one in every five people The city was ranked the world’s most expensive property market for nine straight years to 2018 by research consultancy Demographia’s International Housing Affordability Survey. Even people wanting to rent a subsidised flat have to wait 5.4 years on average, much longer than the promised three years. Other issues that needed the government’s urgent attention included divisions within society, Chan said, while he also admitted the broken trust between protesters and police would not be fixed in the short term. How can Hong Kong’s poor beat poverty when work doesn’t pay? 4 Jan 2019 How can Hong Kong’s poor beat poverty when work doesn’t pay? 4 Jan 2019 Chan said he still saw online rumours about people dying during a police operation in Prince Edward on August 31, despite those stories being completely unfounded. “People just do not believe it is fake,” he said. “I don’t know what type of inquiry can resolve that. “I hope people will look at the bigger picture of Hong Kong, even if we don’t agree with each other. Retail and tourism sectors have been badly affected. If the unrest continues, the downturn will spread to other industries. “Is this in Hong Kong’s best interests? Can we have some common sense to protect rice bowls?” With GDP shrinking at its largest level in a decade, Chan said the economic uncertainty could force companies to move their activities elsewhere, while Yau warned more job losses were likely in the months ahead. Unemployment in tourism-related industries hit a three-year high of 5.2 per cent in the three months to November. The jobless rate in the food and drink sector jumped to 6.2 per cent from September to November, the highest in more than eight years. Asked if Hong Kong’s economic outlook could be worse than during the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic in 2003, Yau said Hong Kong had “to soldier on”. But the commerce minister said it was not all bad news, and pointed to Thailand and other Asean countries – Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Cambodia, Brunei, Myanmar and Laos – as areas of opportunity for growth. The trade bloc and Hong Kong signed a free-trade deal in 2017. “Thailand used to export fragrant rice to Hong Kong. Now they have US$30 billion worth of direct investments in the city, which means it needs our management services,” Yau said. “The country is also known for film post-production.” Last month, Hong Kong and Thailand reached a consensus to collaborate over bilateral trade and investments, the mutual recognition of securities trading and green finance via respective stock exchanges, creative industries, manufacturing, technology development, human resources development and academic exchanges. Law Society vice-president Chan Chak-ming said Hong Kong’s strength in the rule of law positioned it as an arbitration centre as Asean members and former British colonies such as Brunei and Myanmar’s legal systems are based on common law. “We have challenges now, but it is also the best opportunity to tell the world that our rule of law is still robust,” he said.

Shifting jobs from a media company to a Hong Kong financial services business seemed like a good move to Lau. His wife had just had a baby and the new job offered flexible hours and better earnings. That was a year ago, but it didn’t pan out like he planned. As anti-government street protests spread through this city of 7.5 million people since June, the financial planning services his company offered were clearly not a priority for residents. anti-government street protests “New customers have halved in recent weeks – from meeting seven to eight potential customers to three or four, resulting in a 30 to 40 per cent drop in salary,” said Lau, who requested that his first name not be used. “Some potential customers who cancelled said they have no interest in this kind of future financial planning right now,” said Lau, who is in his mid-30s and has a commission-based salary. Lau’s problems are an example of how businesspeople in Hong Kong – one of the world’s premier financial centres and a funnel for hundreds of billions of dollars in investment in and out of China – have faced disruptions caused by the protests and rallies.  Tear gas and Molotov cocktails do nothing to help the city’s image, but at the grass-roots level the chaos in transport networks, such as the firebombing of subways and tunnel tollbooths, means businesses can’t function. Lau said many of his meetings were cancelled because people just couldn’t get around. That’s reflected in other figures. Retail sales fell almost 25 per cent in October and tourist arrivals plunged by half in November. Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said the city’s economy fell into recession in the third quarter for the first time in 10 years. He also forecast a grim outlook for the next financial year even as the government boosts spending on relief measures. economy fell into recession All of which raises many questions about the future of Hong Kong as a financial and business centre and its role as the prime gateway into mainland China as the city’s economy shrinks.    It’s “meaningless” to judge Hong Kong’s economic importance to China by the size of its GDP, Huang said at a Nankai University forum in southern Guangdong province on September 10. Shanghai, Shenzhen and other cities may grow much larger in economic terms over the next 20 years, but Hong Kong’s position would be irreplaceable, because of the “one country, two systems” structure, he said.  Huang was the mayor of Chongqing from 2010 to 2016 and took credit for turning it into the biggest economic driver in southwest China. “One country, two systems is good for the development of Hong Kong and especially good for the development of China,” he said. “The value of Hong Kong lies exactly in being a financial, economic, trade and logistics hub under a capitalist system,” said Huang, who is now a vice-chairman at the state-backed public policy think tank China Centre for International Economic Exchanges. The “proportion of foreign investment through Hong Kong into China has remained more than 50 per cent [of the total] throughout the last 40 years despite the great changes in China’s economy”, he said. Recent figures from China’s Ministry of Commerce suggest Hong Kong continues to play that role. Foreign direct investment flowing through Hong Kong into mainland China grew 10 per cent from January to October this year, and expanded every month since June when the protests began, further highlighting the resilience of the city’s role since its return from being a British colony in 1997. Hong Kong has been the key to China’s economic success story since the opening up of the mainland economy in the late 1970s. Hong Kong tycoons were the first investors and the city’s contribution to China’s GDP peaked at 27 per cent in 1993. Last year, Hong Kong’s GDP made up a total of 2.7 per cent of China’s GDP, but as Huang points out, GDP size misses the point of the city’s real function within China’s economy. Hong Kong: a city locked in stalemate with no end in sight 9 Dec 2019 Hong Kong: a city locked in stalemate with no end in sight 9 Dec 2019 The city grew into one of Asia’s top financial centres based on rule of law and efficient governance. It was named a special administrative region by China in the handover, when Beijing agreed to give the city a high degree of autonomy under the one country, two systems framework. Hong Kong’s stock exchange is also still the favoured destination for initial public offerings by Chinese companies. One in every two companies on the Hong Kong exchange is mainland-linked, representing 67.3 per cent of the market’s capitalisation as of last year, according to exchange data. The biggest recent vote of confidence was the decision by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba to choose Hong Kong for a share sale in November. The company raised about US$11 billion in what was Hong Kong’s largest listing since 2010. (Alibaba is the owner of the South China Morning Post.) South China Morning Post The free movement of capital to both onshore and offshore markets has also made the city the largest offshore yuan trading centre, a key role as Beijing pursues efforts to internationalise China’s currency. Hong Kong also offers special access to China’s equity and fixed income markets through the Stock and Bond Connect systems to capital markets on the mainland. Convenience factor Larry Qiu, an economist at the University of Hong Kong, said Beijing needed Hong Kong because no other mainland city was in a position to replace its role and importance to China’s economy. According to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, nearly 60 per cent of foreign direct investment into China flows through Hong Kong, though much comes from offshore Chinese companies. Last year, 70 per cent of China’s outward investment exited through the city, according to Chinese official data. Despite the political events, the latest figures showed Hong Kong’s role as the window for capital flow into and out of China was unlikely to change, said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING Wholesale Banking. “All money and transactions that pass through Hong Kong as a financial centre are virtual,” Pang said, “Yes, some people found it hard to get to work, but people can survive. The protests may have affected financial workers’ daily living temporarily but it doesn’t change the convenience Hong Kong provides as a centre for banking and financial services on the whole.” Hongkongers rally for detained protesters Hongkongers rally for detained protesters The protests that started in June represent the biggest political turmoil China has faced in decades. What began as rallies against a proposed bill that would allow extradition of legal suspects for trial in mainland China ballooned into wider calls for universal suffrage. Beijing authorities have responded with varying levels of irritation and anger to the protests, especially as some demonstrations descended into violence and vandalism, stressing the importance of the integration of Hong Kong into China’s national development and that it will always be ruled from Beijing. China has also characterised the protests as interference in its domestic affairs by foreign interests. China’s financial market reform opens up opportunities for Hong Kong, strengthens gateway role 21 Sep 2019 China’s financial market reform opens up opportunities for Hong Kong, strengthens gateway role 21 Sep 2019 The politics aside, China’s economy is not expanding at the same pace seen in recent years. GDP growth slowed to 6.2 per cent in the second quarter of 2019, the slowest since records began in March 1992. Some bank economists see that trend continuing, which means Hong Kong’s role as a financial centre remains important for the mainland. “Hong Kong’s economic foundations are based on free capital movement while mainland China still maintains a relatively closed capital account,” said Alicia Garcia Herrero, Asia-Pacific chief economist at Natixis in Hong Kong. “This means Hong Kong can facilitate China’s access to foreign capital.” But Thilo Hanemann, a partner at research house Rhodium Group, said the protests and the response to them had only had “a minor impact” on investment flows into China as of now, but that could change. “We haven’t reached that point yet, where the perception of Hong Kong as an investment destination is irreparably damaged,” he said when speaking to diplomats and bankers in Hong Kong in late November. “But there are looming longer-term concerns about the situation potentially escalating, and undermining the rule of law and institutional set-up that have made Hong Kong such a special place for international investors,” he said. Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping’ protests Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping’ protests Qiu at the University of Hong Kong agreed, saying it’s not just capital flows that the city offers, but people flows, idea flows through the internet and media, as well as rule of law. No mainland city could compare at present, he said, but added that Hong Kong’s advantages were narrowing, and the protests may just speed up that process. Hanemann said some foreign companies had bypassed Hong Kong to enter mainland China’s market directly. “More foreign companies now take advantage of the bilateral treaties their countries have signed with China to directly deal with China, without needing to pass through Hong Kong,” he said. Protests or not, he said companies were aware of the importance of diversifying risk. “Despite China being a lucrative market for many foreign companies and investors, those that have other operations in Asia have been looking at diversifying risks and investments to other countries in the region,” Hanemann said. Lau, the Hong Kong financial planner, doesn’t see much improvement ahead in his business. “Realistically speaking, I think the economy will hit my industry harder next year, Hong Kong’s future is tough,” he said. “But it’s OK, my job is a lot to do with putting in the hard work. Ultimately, I think Hong Kong will prevail.” Read the first part in the series, on the implications of the pro-democrats’ landslide win in the district council polls, here.

Beijing loyalists Lau Siu-kai and Tam Yiu-chung voiced their thoughts on Sunday after Wang Zhenmin, former legal chief of the central government’s liaison office in Hong Kong, said the city must not delay the legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law. Basic Law “I think the central government doesn’t really believe the Hong Kong government under the leadership of Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor will be able to finish the legislation of Article 23 in two or three years,” Lau, vice-chairman of semi-official think tank the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, told the Post. Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor Post “The legislation may not necessarily be the Hong Kong government’s highest priority because of the Legislative Council election next year. The push for legislation is likely to give an edge to the pan-democrats in the election.” On Saturday, Wang, director of Tsinghua University’s Centre for Hong Kong and Macau Research and a central government adviser, told a seminar in Beijing it was now essential for the city to put the legislation on the agenda. Article 23 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, states the city must enact national security laws to prohibit treason, secession, sedition and subversion against the central government. What is the Basic Law of Hong Kong? What is the Basic Law of Hong Kong? The government was forced to shelve the bill in 2003 after half a million people took to the streets.  Lau agreed with the urgency and necessity for the bill. CORONAVIRUS UPDATE Get updates direct to your inbox SUBSCRIBE “But it’s not something you can get done in one or two years even if you rush,” he said.  He believed Beijing never relied on the Hong Kong government solely to protect national security, always having two strings to its bow. He said the central government was already taking action at diplomatic and legal levels to safeguard national security. That included Beijing’s recent sanctions against US-based NGOs for “supporting violence in the city” and its criticism of a local court ruling that found an anti-mask law and the use of emergency laws unconstitutional, Lau said. Xi’s praise for Macau a road map for Hong Kong’s future 20 Dec 2019 Xi’s praise for Macau a road map for Hong Kong’s future 20 Dec 2019 Beijing would have other means – such as applying national laws in Hong Kong or interpreting the Basic Law – if the situation got worse, he said.  “But the Hong Kong government can make full use of its current legal system,” Lau said, citing the Crimes, Public Order, Societies, Official Secrets and Emergency Regulations ordinances as having relevance to ensure national security. Tam, Hong Kong’s sole delegate to the country’s top legislative body, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, also said it was very difficult to get the legislation passed after the social unrest that had rocked the city for more than six months. National People’s Congress “Article 23 has already been stigmatised,” he said. “But from the central government’s point of view, it’s necessary to keep reminding the Hong Kong authorities that this must be done.” On Friday, President Xi Jinping praised Macau for making efforts to protect national security – remarks that were widely interpreted as an indirect but obvious “to-do” list for Hong Kong. Xi Jinping widely interpreted Macau saw no large-scale protests when it enacted its national security law in 2009. 	SCMP

In a Facebook post on Sunday, Lam noted the far-reaching impact of the practice of putting people’s personal information in the public domain for malicious purposes, saying it was only ever done with the intention of silencing free speech. She suggested she had again been the victim of doxxing, but did not elaborate on what personal information had been released and on what platform. Privacy watchdog refers 600 cases of doxxing to police 28 Aug 2019 Privacy watchdog refers 600 cases of doxxing to police 28 Aug 2019 “Someone told me that it was worrying to see my personal information being exposed in online chat groups. What I’m worried about is not the disclosure of my personal information, it had been exposed earlier after all,” she wrote. “I’m worried about the impact of doxxing on society. There is only one purpose of doxxing, it is to silence others. Victims are not only those who were doxxed, but the whole of society.” In July, the personal information, including mobile phone numbers and dates of birth, of a dozen government officials and pro-establishment politicians, including Lam, was briefly published in a popular online forum where anti-government protesters often exchange information.  Privacy commissioner for personal data Stephen Wong Kai-yi said in November that over the past several months, the number of doxxing and cyberbullying complaints and cases had jumped to 3,373, from dozens received annually in previous years. Social media channel used for doxxing police suspended after court order 17 Dec 2019 Social media channel used for doxxing police suspended after court order 17 Dec 2019 In her Facebook post, Lam also cited an appeal court ruling on the doxxing of police officers, and urged people not to let emotion cloud their judgment.   She further quoted: “If doxxing practices are not curtailed, the fire of distrust, fear and hatred ignited by them will soon consume the public’s confidence in the law and order of the community, leading to disintegration of our society.” Doxxing: the powerful ‘weapon’ in the Hong Kong protests had a petty beginning 11 Nov 2019 Doxxing: the powerful ‘weapon’ in the Hong Kong protests had a petty beginning 11 Nov 2019 Against the background of the civil unrest sweeping the city, the number of cases of doxxing has increased rapidly, as has that of cyber bullying.

Wang Zhenmin, director of Tsinghua University’s Centre for Hong Kong and Macau Research, told a seminar in Beijing, that it was now an essential task for the city to put Article 23 legislation on the agenda. The legal scholar was referring to a clause under the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, which stipulates that the city must enact its own national security law – a proposal that prompted mass protests in 2003. Wang was speaking a day after President Xi Jinping praised Macau for making efforts to protect national security – remarks that were widely interpreted as an indirect but obvious “to-do” list for Hong Kong. Macau saw no large-scale protests when it enacted its national security law in 2009, unlike in Hong Kong six years previously, when the government abandoned the plan after half a million people took to the streets. Macau marks 20 years since former the Portuguese colony’s return to China Macau marks 20 years since former the Portuguese colony’s return to China Under Article 23 of the Basic Law, national security laws should prohibit seven types of activity: treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the central government, theft of state secrets, the hosting of political activities by foreign political organisations or bodies, and the establishment of ties between local and foreign political organisations.  Wang said five types of behaviour were already covered by existing Hong Kong law, but did not specify what these were. He said that in these cases the “issue is about implementation”, but called on the Hong Kong government to take the lead in addressing the other two areas.   “But since it is stipulated in the Basic Law that the Special Administrative Region government has the power to legislate, our view is that the SAR government should do its best to complete the legislative work first.”  He continued: “The central government also has its responsibilities so [we need to] work together on this.” Three years ago, Hong Kong’s former justice minister Elsie Leung Oi-sie argued that all seven activities could be covered by existing ordinances, which could be gradually amended to enact Article 23. Hongkongers rally for detained protesters Hongkongers rally for detained protesters The seminar was organised by Global Times, a tabloid affiliated to the Communist Party’s mouthpiece People’s Daily. Global Times People’s Daily Other speakers included Tam Yiu-chung, a pro-Beijing politician from Hong Kong, and Wei Jianguo, a former vice-minister of commerce. The full-day seminar covered not only the past six months of social and political unrest in Hong Kong – triggered by a now withdrawn bill to allow the extradition of criminal suspects to the mainland – but also relations with the US, Taiwan and the rise of populism worldwide. In his comments, Wang also blamed the Hong Kong government for failing to build up its authority since the 1997 handover. Nearly a fifth of Hong Kong voters say they support violent actions by protesters 21 Dec 2019 Nearly a fifth of Hong Kong voters say they support violent actions by protesters 21 Dec 2019 “The [SAR] government is not as authoritative [as the colonial government] before the handover,” he said. “But this is not a constitutional problem. The Basic Law has inherited the fine traditions of the political system before the handover but the chief executives have made the SAR government weak. “To build the SAR government’s authority, all [you need to do] is to strictly implement the law.” Wang said the law gave the chief executive, the city’s top official, extensive powers, but many of these had not been “put to good use”. What does ‘one country, two systems’ mean? What does ‘one country, two systems’ mean? Another speaker Jiang Shigong, a professor at Peking University, said that while Beijing had limited leeway in dealing with Hong Kong, it needed to adopt a more authoritative stance. He said that because Article 23 covered national security, it was a matter that concerned the central government, but the legislation was the city government’s responsibility. “Back in the colonial times, it was London that made the decisions,” Jiang said. “[After the handover], the SAR government took up the burden of making political decisions but it turned out that the civil servants had no idea how to make such decisions because they have been taking orders [for all these years].” Jiang said the central government “can only give very general directions and point out [the current situation] is the result of some deep-rooted problems, but the Hong Kong government doesn’t even understand what those deep-rooted problems are”. To improve governance he said Beijing had to “take up this responsibility in laying out very specific instructions” for the city’s government to follow. 	SCMP

Post The findings of the survey, which asked voters for their views on the protesters’ range of tactics among other questions, suggested Hongkongers had a threshold of the level of violence they would tolerate. There appeared to be a baseline of 5 per cent of voters who said they “strongly support” more violent actions such as attacking opponents, hurling bricks and petrol bombs and damaging public facilities. Another 13 per cent or so said they “somewhat support” such actions. But across the board, there was a bigger group that was supportive of milder actions such as vandalising businesses with links to mainland China, blocking MTR stations and blocking roads. Hongkongers rally for detained protesters Hongkongers rally for detained protesters Of 832 surveyed, 54 per cent said they voted for a pro-democracy candidate during the November 24 district council polls, while the rest said they supported a pro-government candidate or an independent. Those who said they did not vote were screened out and not included in the results.  The online survey was conducted not from a universal sample but a panel composed of 150,000 people in Hong Kong from all walks of life. The reported findings have been weighted by age and sex to better align with the 2019 registered voter statistics. The survey was conducted as the protests passed the six-month mark earlier in December. The movement, which began in opposition to an extradition bill which has since been withdrawn, has morphed into a wider anti-government protest calling for greater democracy and police accountability. Among seven tactics used by the demonstrators over the past months, the most acceptable, according to the poll, was the use of laser pointers against the police, which 58 per cent of pro-democracy voters supported. Only 14 per cent of pro-establishment voters supported such actions.  Close to half of pro-democracy voters also said they supported non-violent protest acts such as the blocking of MTR trains and major roads.  The least supported act was attacking opponents who hold different political views, which 18 per cent of those surveyed supported, with 5 per cent strongly supporting such actions and the remaining 13 per cent somewhat supportive of it. While 30 per cent of those who voted for the pro-democracy camp said they supported such attacks, only 8 per cent of pro-government voters felt the same way. Because of the government’s inaction and lack of response to the public’s demands, people now support, empathise with and accept these protest means. I don’t find it surprising League of Social Democrats chairman Avery Ng Since June, about 10 pro-democracy election candidates and protest organisers have been physically attacked, including Civil Human Rights Front convenor Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, who was assaulted by a group wielding hammers. Pro-establishment legislator Junius Ho Kwan-yiu was attacked with a knife while campaigning for the district council election. The was also violence among non-politicians. A 57-year-old man was set on fire in November, suffering severe burns, after chasing protesters who had vandalised a railway station in Ma On Shan. A cleaner, 70, who was taking pictures of black-clad protesters, died after he was hit with a brick. Hong Kong police shot at by man linked to protest-related weapon seizures 21 Dec 2019 Hong Kong police shot at by man linked to protest-related weapon seizures 21 Dec 2019 A student, 19, who was distributing leaflets in support of the protests in Tai Po in October was stabbed by a mainland Chinese man in the neck and stomach. Survey respondents split similarly on the question of petrol bombs and bricks, 18 per cent saying they supported protesters throwing the projectiles, again with 5 per cent strongly supporting such violence and the remaining 13 per cent somewhat supportive of it. Among pro-democracy voters, 31 per cent accepted such acts, while only 7 per cent of those who voted pro-government or non-partisan shared the view. League of Social Democrats chairman Avery Ng Man-yuen, an advocate of peaceful mass civil disobedience, said the violence stemmed from mistrust among civilians and authorities’ mishandling of protests. “Because of the government’s inaction and lack of response to the public’s demands, people now support, empathise with and accept these protest means,” Ng said. “I don’t find it surprising.” Ng said some of the life-threatening attacks were “tragedies”, but warned more could happen if the government did not proactively mend the rifts in society. Meanwhile, fewer voters supported damaging public facilities (19 per cent) than supported vandalism against private property such as mainland Chinese businesses (25 per cent). Among both groups, pro-democracy voters supported the acts in greater numbers than those from the other camps. Political scientist Dr Edmund Cheng Wai of City University said protesters, riding on public support, had been “pushing the limits” over the past six months as they interacted with the police. He believed members of the public tended to be more upset with vandalism of public property as they could not see how the institutions affected – such as universities – had barred the protesters from achieving their goals.

Around two dozen riot police entered Harbour City in the tourist district of Tsim Sha Tsui and carried out a sweep of the mall, teaming up with a group of undercover colleagues who had been stationed inside all afternoon as several hundred masked anti-government protesters roamed around during a so-called Christmas shopping rally. Already high, tensions were ratcheted up as protesters, who had been in the mall for hours chanting slogans and focusing on shops seen as pro-government to scare away consumers, claimed a plain-clothes officer reached for his sidearm. A police commander later denied the incident took place. Several scuffles had already broken out between protesters and a group of about 10 plain-clothes officers, who were quickly identified as police after they entered the mall. Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping protesters’ confronted by police Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping protesters’ confronted by police In one instance, pepper spray was used as a mob tried to charge at police after they briefly detained a protester said to have threatened one of the officers. A youngster who was pepper-sprayed said riot police rushed into the mall, urging everybody to leave. But he said they had no way to move away and riot police sprayed them anyway. Meanwhile, masked radicals struck after a sit-in at Yoho mall to mark the five-month anniversary of the Yuen Long MTR station attack on protesters and passengers, vandalising a Genki Sushi restaurant before police arrived. The outlet was targeted in the mall, next to the station, after about 100 people had gathered to commemorate the July 21 attack, which was carried out by a group of white-clad men and left dozens injured. Dozens of riot police arrived to disperse protesters and onlookers in the mall and were heckled. About 20 black-clad protesters then headed to Castle Peak Road at about 4.50pm and smashed traffic lights. An onlooker said protesters hit a man on Tai Tong Road after he used foul language against them. Blood was spilled and the man was taken away by ambulance. Nearly one in five Hongkongers supports protest violence, Post survey finds 21 Dec 2019 Nearly one in five Hongkongers supports protest violence, Post survey finds 21 Dec 2019 In the mall, police searched at least one person. Riot police returned to the mall at around 9pm, formed a cordon, and arrested several people for criminal damage. An outlet of Heytea, a mainland China-based beverage firm, was targeted.  Radicals frequently target restaurants operated by Maxim’s Group, including Genki, after its founder’s daughter called protesters “rioters”, and said they did not represent Hong Kong. They also focus on shops and banks with links to the mainland. Earlier, those at the sit-in aired grievances against police, who they said failed to respond quickly enough to the July 21 attack, which resulted in 45 people needing hospital treatment. “Dismiss the police force, no more delays,” the crowd chanted.  The MTR Corporation shut down Yuen Long station at 1pm on Saturday.

Around 80 riot police officers were stationed on Canton Road, a busy shopping street on which there are entrances to the mall. Protesters quickly identified a group of plain-clothes police who had followed them into the mall. The officer in charge showed his warrant card and urged them to stay peaceful after protesters surrounded them.

University station, which is attached to Chinese University’s Sha Tin campus, had been closed by the MTR Corporation since November 12. Back then, the campus was the site of clashes between protesters and police, during which thousands of tear gas rounds and other non-lethal ammunition were met with petrol bombs and bricks. During clashes, the railway firm said, glass inside the station was shattered and communication facilities destroyed. Some equipment was taken and ticketing facilities were trashed, it said, adding earlier that restoring the station had been no different to rebuilding it. Inside Hong Kong’s vandalised MTR stations Inside Hong Kong’s vandalised MTR stations The university, which cancelled classes from November 13, will start the next semester on January 6. On Saturday, three out of four station exits were opened, with more security guards than usual standing at turnstiles.  A security booth had been set up outside exit B. Anyone looking to enter the campus via the station was asked to present student or staff identification, or register at the booth. The exit which remained closed – exit D, inside the campus – was still boarded up, following vandalism by protesters. Plastic boards and barbed wire were installed along exposed railway tracks inside the campus. Last month, objects were thrown onto the tracks to disrupt traffic.  At 10am on Saturday, the station was not particularly busy, and most shops attached to it remained shut.   An insurance agent, aged 50, said the closure had added 30 minutes to her commute from Tai Po to Ma On Shan. She said she had to take the MTR to Tai Wai over the past month, and change to the Ma On Shan line.

But a university student, surnamed Leung, on his way to campus in Tai Po from Tseung Kwan O, said he was not hit hard by the closure. “The effect of the closure was not huge. I could have taken other transport,” the 24-year-old said. Leung also said he was dissatisfied with the MTR Corp’s performance during the months-long protests. The rail operator has become a lightning rod for demonstrators’ fury during the more than half a year of unrest, protesters accusing it of colluding with police during the force’s clearance operations. “Unless it is necessary, I don’t take the MTR,” Leung said. A sales worker in his 30s also said he did not mind the closure, as he had other means of getting to work. 	SCMP

Post More than half of those polled said police actions had been harsh or excessive and nearly two-thirds supported setting up a commission of inquiry into the force’s conduct, a core demand of the protest movement. There was even greater agreement among voters on the city’s prospects after the long-running protests: almost 80 per cent of voters across the political spectrum and age groups were overwhelmingly pessimistic about their future in Hong Kong. The online survey, conducted by consultancy Blackbox Research, polled 832 Hong Kong adults between November 30 and December 2 who voted in the district council elections in November, in which the opposition pro-democracy bloc scored a landslide victory by netting almost 90 per cent of the 452 seats at stake. district council elections in November landslide victory by netting almost 90 per cent of the 452 seats at stake   About 54 per cent of respondents said they voted for the pro-democracy bloc, while the remaining 46 per cent said they backed pro-establishment or independent candidates. But 65 per cent of respondents believed the election result would only trigger even tougher measures against future protests, while 54 per cent argued it would force the government to set up an independent probe to look into the police’s handling of the demonstrations.  About 53 per cent of liberal voters said they went to the polls to fight for democracy, followed by 49 per cent who said they cast their ballots to protest against police conduct.  Hong Kong has been rocked by more than six months of anti-government protests, triggered by the government’s now-withdrawn extradition bill. anti-government protests  About 73 per cent of respondents – including 65 per cent of the self-identified pro-establishment voters and 81 per cent pro-democracy voters – said the protests had eroded people’s trust in the police force. For voters, this has emerged to be the biggest negative consequence of the protests, followed by damage to the city’s economy, which 71 per cent agreed had been negatively affected.  Meanwhile, 52 per cent of respondents – 55 per cent of pro-establishment voters and 48 per cent of democracy supporters – said the protests had negatively affected people’s trust in the judiciary. Only 12 per cent of respondents said the protests had brought a positive impact on their estimation of the courts and judicial system, while 36 said there was no impact.   The perception of damage to the police’s reputation was supported by the findings in which 53 per cent of respondents said officers’ actions towards protesters were “too harsh or excessive”. Only 23 per cent of them described it as adequate, while 24 per cent of them called them “too lenient or insufficient”. Around 26 per cent of respondents said they had no trust at all in police, including 10 per cent of pro-establishment voters and 45 per cent of pro-democracy voters. Only 7 per cent were prepared to give police officers their full trust. David Black, founder and managing director of Blackbox Research, said the most stunning result was the finding that a significant portion of Hongkongers did not trust the police force and even treated it as the enemy. Citing the finding that nearly 30 per cent had no trust at all in the police, he said: “It is a figure we expect to see in authoritarian states.” Black suggested the government look into the issue if it wanted to resolve the political impasse.   Among the five demands of protesters, two appeared to have greater across-the-board support than the others: two-thirds of all polled voters supported an independent probe into police conduct during protests, followed by the 61 per cent who asked for universal suffrage. There was, however, less agreement on the other two unanswered demands. More than 40 per cent called on the government to stop characterising the protests as “riots” and only 29 per cent said all arrested protesters should be released and have their charges dropped. Hong Kong police face questions over targeting journalists during weekend protests Hong Kong police face questions over targeting journalists during weekend protests Hong Kong’s embattled leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, in September responded to one of the five demands, which was to fully withdraw the hated bill, while dismissing the need to debate the other demands. About 56 per cent of voters said they were only asking for greater autonomy for Hong Kong, and only 16 per cent of them said they supported the notion of breaking away from China.   Over time, pro-democracy voters also tended to be more tolerant towards more radical protest means but they clearly drew the line between vandalising private and public property. About 42 per cent supported vandalising shops and restaurants said to be linked to mainland China or against the protests, but only 32 per cent agreed with damaging railway and university facilities. New Hong Kong’s police chief on duty after China appointment amid ongoing protests New Hong Kong’s police chief on duty after China appointment amid ongoing protests While the ongoing confrontation has widened the rift in Hong Kong, it appears to have hit conservative voters harder than liberals. Almost 60 per cent of pro-establishment respondents said the protests had harmed social cohesion and the spirit and will of Hongkongers, but around half of their opponents actually said it had brought a positive impact. Chinese University political scientist Ivan Choy Chi-keung lamented that Hong Kong was stuck in a stalemate caused by the intransigence of Beijing and the city government. “Hongkongers’ dissatisfaction with police has not dissipated following the district council elections,” he said. “The central and local governments have refused to order an independent probe and want to see if the movement loses its support as time goes by. But various studies have already proven that it has not happened. That’s the root of the stalemate which has frustrated many people.” 	SCMP

A source close to the government said several retired judges had turned down offers to head an independent review committee to look into the problems, while the chief executive had drawn a negative response from Beijing when she raised the question of forming a commission of inquiry during her duty visit to the capital last week. It was not clear if she brought the matter before President Xi Jinping or Premier Li Keqiang during her four-day trip, which ended on Tuesday. Xi expressed strong support for the city’s police to firmly enforce the law during his meeting with Lam on Monday. While an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct has long been a core demand of the protest movement, Lam is worried about alienating the force when her government is relying heavily on police to curb protest violence. The source said the government had approached a few retired judges over the past two months to take up the chair of the independent review committee, which is being set up instead to investigate the underlying causes of the protests. The Post understands the government favours a retired judge for the position, and Andrew Li Kwok-nang, Hong Kong’s first chief justice, was its top choice. Post  When approached by the Post on Thursday, Li said he had no comment on whether he had been offered the role. Post The city has been gripped by civil unrest and street protests since June, sparked by fierce opposition to the now-withdrawn extradition bill. Hongkongers rally for detained protesters Hongkongers rally for detained protesters Several opinion polls indicate that most Hongkongers support an independent inquiry, but Lam has insisted on leaving all questions over police conduct during the protests to the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC).  The credibility of the process has been further called into question after five overseas experts invited to take part in the investigation stood aside after finding the mechanism ineffective.  Lam said last month an independent review committee would be set up as well to find out the underlying causes of the turmoil. On Monday, Secretary for Labour and Welfare Law Chi-kwong outlined the powers of the proposed panel, which is to look into the socio-economic and political causes. The committee, however, will not make conclusions or adjudicate on individual complaints against the police force, which the government wants left to the IPCC, an organisation that protesters accuse of lacking independence and lacking sufficient investigative powers. On Tuesday, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung shot down the need to give the review committee subpoena powers to compel witnesses to give evidence. Lam admitted on Monday that some people might be worried about being bullied online if they worked for the government, responding to a question on whether it was facing difficulty in recruiting candidates for the review committee. But she remained confident that appropriate candidates would be found. Law said earlier it was unlikely the panel would be in place by the end of this year. 	SCMP

China’s Xinhua state news agency added on Saturday that during the call Xi told Trump that China is deeply concerned about “negative words and actions” by the US on issues relating to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet.  “Xi noted that the US’ behaviours have interfered in China's internal affairs and harmed China's interests, which is detrimental to the mutual trust and bilateral cooperation,” Xinhua said. Lau Siu-kai, the vice-chairman of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said it was possible that the Chinese government had requested the US not to execute the recently passed Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.  The law opens the way for sanctions against mainland Chinese and Hong Kong officials whom Washington deems to have committed human rights abuses against pro-democracy activists. US and China reach ‘phase-one’ trade deal US and China reach ‘phase-one’ trade deal “[Beijing] knows that Trump has to sign the act as it was passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate ... what it could do was ask not to execute this act,” Lau said.  “With the word ‘progress’, Trump might have told President Xi that he would act carefully,” he said. He added that any action taken by the US against Hong Kong could hamper American economic and political interests in the city. The “phase one"" agreement announced last week between the two giants is the latest chapter in an 18-month trade war that has rattled global markets and raised tensions. Much of the deal’s fine print has not been released. But as outlined, Washington agreed to postpone tariffs on around US$160 billion of mostly Chinese-made consumer goods scheduled to go into effect last Sunday. The two sides agreed to leave tougher issues for “phase two” and even “phase three” pacts, although some doubt these instalments will materialise, given how difficult it has been to get this far. North Korea on agenda as US envoy Stephen Biegun visits China 20 Dec 2019 North Korea on agenda as US envoy Stephen Biegun visits China 20 Dec 2019 John Sitilides, a geopolitical strategist at Trilogy ­Advisors in Washington, said that Trump may want to engage with Xi with “greater political momentum and available negotiating leverage than ever”, given impeachment proceedings against the president that seem to have “strengthened his prospects for re-election in November 2020”, as supporters rally around him. Late on Wednesday, the House of Representatives formally voted to impeach Trump on charges that he abused his office and obstructed Congress. The next step would see the accusations go to the Republican-controlled Senate, where they would be almost certain to be voted down. Trump is keen to avoid anything that would act as a drag on consumption, markets and the wider economy, as he gears up for a re-election campaign in 2020, analysts said. But the benefits of this phase one trade deal go both ways, also serving Xi's political interests, they added. Donald Trump becomes third US president in history to be impeached Donald Trump becomes third US president in history to be impeached ""To stave off further tariffs, Mr Xi sees he may have no choice but to negotiate with President Trump in further talks through 2024 on more difficult issues, such as Beijing's protectionist policies over favoured domestic industries and on codifying structural changes to China's constitution,” Sitilides said. The analyst added that Xi also seeks Trump's support in holding back growing US criticism of the Chinese Communist Party's handling of the Hong Kong protests and the Xinjiang human rights violations against Uygur Muslims, as well as Congressional calls for a television boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. Trudeau to Trump: Don’t sign US-China trade deal until Canadians released 20 Dec 2019 Trudeau to Trump: Don’t sign US-China trade deal until Canadians released 20 Dec 2019 Trump signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act last month, while both houses of Congress also have passed legislation requiring a stronger response to Beijing's treatment of its Uygur Muslim minority, although it has not yet become law. Experts noted that the announced trade agreement and the leaders' phone call do not necessarily signal that bilateral tensions will continue to ease. The context, they add, is what some have characterised as deepening strategic rivalry. Sean King, a former official in the US Department of Commerce who is now a senior vice-president at the political consulting firm Park Strategies, said Trump wants to “keep the good economic times rolling and be able to say he's made a deal that no one else could have”. US-China trade deal is a poor bargain for US businesses and consumers 19 Dec 2019 US-China trade deal is a poor bargain for US businesses and consumers 19 Dec 2019 ""[Also,] leaders call each other all the time and President Trump personalises diplomacy more than most. Hence the call doesn't strike me as anything out of the ordinary,” King said He added that Beijing is unlikely to move closer to Washington’s world view on Hong Kong or North Korea so “any real cooperation here suggests [Washington] blinked somewhere along the way”. The North Korean issue may also arise as a battle ground – not as a common ground – between the two states in the future. Pyongyang has been threatening Washington with what it called a “Christmas gift” that US officials interpret as either a nuclear weapons test or a ballistic missile test. On Monday Beijing – along with Moscow – proposed that the UN Security Council lift sanctions against North Korea. But Washington baulked at the idea, with a State Department official saying the move was “premature” for North Korea. Trump impeachment clouds prospects for US-China trade war talks 20 Dec 2019 Trump impeachment clouds prospects for US-China trade war talks 20 Dec 2019 Washington believes that Beijing is not playing enough of a role in denuclearising North Korea, said a former US official who requested anonymity because of the issue’s sensitivity. Soo Kim, a former CIA analyst now at the Rand Corporation, a global policy think tank, noted that China's growing influence in the Korean peninsula presents a challenge to Washington. “Beijing's gravitational pull is drawing in not only North Korea but perhaps South Korea, as well,” she said. “Seoul's ongoing cost-sharing negotiations with Washington and the two countries' divergent positions on dealing with North Korea give reason to suspect [or] fear the US and the ROK [are] going separate ways.” Seoul, the analyst added, has also indicated it might be weighing other options following a meeting between South Korea’s and China’s defence chiefs. “Maybe China will seek a more moderating, truly mediating role between Pyongyang and Seoul to maintain its own interests of stability and reduce the influence of the US in the region,” Kim said. “And obviously, this would also impact the security and stability of Japan.” Additional reporting by Elizabeth Cheung and Reuters Additional reporting by Elizabeth Cheung and Reuters "	SCMP

The force also warned that an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle seized in a follow-up flat raid was the same model used in the 2017 Las Vegas shooting which killed 58 people, adding that the weapon could cause severe casualties as it had a range of up to 800 metres. 2017 Las Vegas shooting As of Saturday evening, the 18-year-old suspect was still in police custody for questioning. “Intelligence and initial investigation showed he was part of the syndicate that involved plots to attack police with bombs and firearms at the massive anti-government march on December 8,” the force insider said. Police foil second bomb plot in under a week and arrest three men 14 Dec 2019 Police foil second bomb plot in under a week and arrest three men 14 Dec 2019 Police said that when officers, acting on intelligence, intercepted the man at the Jade Plaza residential estate just after 9.20pm, he pulled a semi-automatic pistol from his waist and fired one round at them. The bullet did not hit anyone.  After they arrested the suspect, surnamed Su, officers raided a flat at the estate where they seized the AR-15 with 211 rounds of ammunition – 61 rounds in a speed loader and the rest in five magazines. Senior Superintendent Steve Li Kwai-wah from the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau said 44 hollow-point rounds for the P80 pistol the suspect used were collected from the crime scene and the flat they raided. A shell from the gun was also picked up at the scene of the shooting.  “The firearms and ammunition found match the intelligence we collected, which is about someone planning to use guns in public assemblies to hurt people, including officers on duty” Li said, adding that the suspect did not hold any firearm licence. He said the pistol and ammunition seized on Friday night were of the same make as those found during an earlier raid in a North Point flat. Police defuse two home-made bombs found on school grounds 10 Dec 2019 Police defuse two home-made bombs found on school grounds 10 Dec 2019 The arrested man was identified as a suspect detained last December for illegal possession of firearms. He had been in custody until February 28 this year when he was released on bail. Police said he had breached bail conditions on December 8, when the mass march was held.  Another police insider said he believed the suspect assembled the rifle in stages, and that it posed a tremendous threat to public safety. Riot police arrived at the scene soon after the incident to provide support for officers who were escorting the hooded and handcuffed suspect when they were confronted by an angry crowd. Objects were thrown at the officers from above. Police initially raised a warning flag, then fired tear gas at the crowd at around 11pm. They fired another round almost an hour later in an attempt to disperse a crowd that lingered near the scene. Commissioner of Police Chris Tang Ping-keung also visited the site after midnight, and stayed for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Journalists Association condemned police in statement on Saturday evening, accusing the force of brutality on reporters during the incident in Tai Po. The group claimed police used a baton to hit a reporter from local outlet Stand News and pepper-sprayed others, adding that officers had affected press freedom. Earlier this month, police seized two powerful home-made bombs and batches of weapons, including a semi-automatic pistol, believed to be intended for use against officers during protest clashes. The arrested suspects have been brought to court. 	SCMP

Political commentator Johnny Lau Yui-siu said Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speeches during his three-day visit to Macau, which ended on Friday, indicated that the central government was not satisfied with Hong Kong’s failure to match Macau in areas such as the operation of an executive-led political system, and respect for the central government’s authority. Delivering his speech at a banquet in Macau on Thursday, Xi praised the city’s people for understanding that the executive authorities and the legislature should support each other, while also acting as a check and balance, but of the two mutual support was most important. Speaking at the city government’s inauguration ceremony after overseeing the swearing-in of Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng on Friday, Xi said the executive authorities, the legislature and the judiciary “correctly handled their relationship” to ensure the respect for the chief executives' authority, and the smooth operation of the executive-led political system. Lau said Xi had a long-held belief that the three branches of the government in Hong Kong should work together. During his visit to Hong Kong as vice-president in July 2008, Xi called for “mutual understanding and support among the executive authorities, the legislature and the judiciary” to maintain Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity.  “By citing the collaboration between executive authorities and the legislature in Macau, Xi was actually scolding Hong Kong subtly by ostensibly pointing to Macau,” Lau said. The central government doesn’t demand Hongkongers love the Communist Party. It just hopes Hong Kong people not to do anything that would threaten national security Vice-chairman of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies Lau Siu-kai Lau said he expected Hong Kong’s government to step up patriotic education in local schools in the years ahead. CORONAVIRUS UPDATE Get updates direct to your inbox SUBSCRIBE “In recent years, many Hong Kong deputies to the National People’s Congress gave lectures in local schools. We can expect more of such arrangements in the future,” he said.  Xi was the second state leader this month who praised Macau for successfully implementing the “one country, two systems” principle, which applies to the two special administrative regions. Macau marks 20 years since former the Portuguese colony’s return to China Macau marks 20 years since former the Portuguese colony’s return to China Speaking at an event in Beijing on December 3 to mark the 20th anniversary of Macau’s Basic Law, National People’s Congress chairman Li Zhanshu described the city as a role model for implementing one country, two systems, and called on Hong Kong to learn from the casino hub.  Li said the central government had the same demands for both Hong Kong and Macau. Macau introduced its own national security law 10 years ago to implement Article 23 of its Basic Law, and set up a national security commission last year. Xi’s message of pride in Macau seen as a rebuke of wayward Hong Kong 19 Dec 2019 Xi’s message of pride in Macau seen as a rebuke of wayward Hong Kong 19 Dec 2019 The Hong Kong government, on the other hand, backed down from putting Article 23 of the city’s Basic Law in place after 500,000 people took to the streets to protest against it on July 1, 2003. Tian Feilong, an associate professor at Beihang University’s law school in Beijing, said Macau had attached great importance to safeguarding national security, while Hong Kong had not done enough in this aspect. “President Xi’s speech can be seen as a reminder for Hong Kong to do a better job,” Tian said. “If Hong Kong does not take into account the need to safeguard national security but only cares about two systems, the implementation of one country, two systems in Hong Kong will be distorted,” the mainland academic said. What does ‘one country, two systems’ mean? What does ‘one country, two systems’ mean? Tian said while Hong Kong had yet to enact laws to implement Article 23 of the Basic Law, the Hong Kong government and the city’s courts should try their best to safeguard national security. Speaking at the Macau government’s inauguration ceremony, Xi warned against any foreign interference there or in Hong Kong, saying it would not be tolerated. Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of the semi-official think tank, the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said Xi’s key message in his speech on Friday was to rebut the suggestion from some quarters that one country, two systems had failed, in the wake of the anti-government protests. “The central government is confident that Macau has set an example for successful implementation of the one country, two systems,” Lau Siu-kai said. “Although Hong Kong has been rocked by protests for more than six months, Beijing still believes Hong Kong can reboot itself by drawing from Macau’s experience.” Executive councillor Ronny Tong Ka-wah agreed Xi’s speeches over the past few days were an indication of the central government identifying the inadequacies in the governance of Hong Kong. “We’re painfully aware of the shortcomings of the implementation of one country, two systems in Hong Kong,” he said. “But the situation in Hong Kong is quite different from Macau. We hope President Xi understands the reality of that. “The government’s attempt to enact the extradition bill has already caused a big fuss in recent months. Hong Kong could be turned upside down if the government tries to revive the national security legislation.” But Lau Siu-kai believed Beijing only set a minimal requirement for Hong Kong in implementing one country, two systems. “The central government doesn’t demand Hongkongers love the Communist Party,” he said. “It just hopes Hong Kong people don’t do anything that would threaten national security.” 	SCMP

Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung also urged schools to suspend teachers arrested for serious offences, out of concern for students’ safety. Yeung revealed the latest fallout of the ongoing civil unrest, which has seen students make up nearly 40 per cent of the 6,000 people arrested. According to the Education Bureau, there were 123 complaints of protest-related misconduct against teachers between mid-June and late November. While Yeung said 80 teachers and teaching assistants had been arrested so far, the bureau did not say how many of those had also been the subject of a complaint. The bureau also revealed four teachers had resigned or had been suspended by their schools, including a teacher charged with possessing a weapon, and a government-school teacher accused of making bias teaching materials. The bureau failed to provide details on the two other cases.  Among the 123 complaints, investigations had been completed in 74 cases, with wrongdoing confirmed in 13 of those, and dismissed in another 30. The remaining 31 cases were initially substantiated, but some are still being reviewed or waiting for explanations from the teachers involved. Hong Kong protests: arrested teacher suspended following appeal from government Hong Kong protests: arrested teacher suspended following appeal from government 12 Dec 2019 Six teachers were either given a warning or condemnation, while seven others were issued with advisory letters. Apart from the disciplinary action taken by the bureau, Yeung said some schools had also taken other action over the complaints like demotion, postponement of salary increase, or transferring the teachers to another post.  Yeung said at a press conference on Friday most of the complaints the bureau received were related to hate speech or provocative acts, while others involved inappropriate teaching materials or violation of the law.  He said teachers were subjected to a higher standard in their speech and actions, as many pupils were still forming their own values. “Most teachers are dedicated to their job and have taught students in an unbiased way over the past few months. But there are still some black sheep who caused doubts on teachers and left professional educators in shame,” Yeung said. “When we talk about the messages or the remarks they made, we are not just talking about their political opinions, we are talking about hate messages, and some of them were very improper, if judged by the standard of society.” The bureau’s permanent secretary, Ingrid Yeung Ho Poi-yan, also said political views of teachers, or whom they sided with, was not a concern when the bureau was handling complaints. “Our only concern are the values behind their speech, whether their speech amount to hate speech or whether their speech would have a bad influence on our children,” Ho said. One of the government-school teachers was suspended over repeated findings of “inappropriate teaching materials”, the bureau said, and disciplinary action would be taken according to Civil Service Regulations. A 13-year-old Hong Kong protester shares his story A 13-year-old Hong Kong protester shares his story On Friday, the bureau also issued a letter to principals and supervisors of primary and secondary schools listing how schools should handle cases of teachers arrested over the protests. It urged schools to suspend teachers charged with serious offences such as arson, assault, rioting or possession of dangerous materials or weapons for the sake of students’ safety. If teachers were arrested but not charged, schools should also consider whether they were still suitable to teach, or if they should be relocated to other posts. Teachers ‘not given a chance to defend themselves’ after Hong Kong protests 20 Dec 2019 Teachers ‘not given a chance to defend themselves’ after Hong Kong protests 20 Dec 2019 Ip Kin-yuen, an education sector lawmaker and vice-president of the pro-democracy Professional Teachers’ Union, accused the bureau of not providing clear guidelines on what constitutes hate speech, or provocative acts, as many of the cases involved comments teachers had shared privately with friends on social media platforms. “This is completely unacceptable,” he said. “The [Education Bureau] should make it clear which wordings or speech would constitute hate speech, for instance calling protesters ‘cockroaches’,” he said. Yeung said even when teachers’ comments were made on social media, they could have an impact on others. Teachers should act professionally, according to the code of conduct, even online. Ip said the union would provide help to teachers who were suspended, or had resigned. The pro-establishment Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers also agreed the bureau should make public the reasons for punishing a teacher in each case. 	SCMP

Mr Justice Keith Yeung Kar-hung of the High Court granted permission to an application for judicial review filed by social worker and activist Hendrick Lui Chi-hang, who contended the city’s Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) had gone beyond its statutory powers by proactively starting a probe into the civil unrest triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. The watchdog is investigating police’s conduct during some of the large-scale public order events since June 9, with a special focus on the violent clashes outside the legislature on June 9 and 12, and the storming of the Legislative Council on July 1, in a first-phase report to be compiled by January. But the judge found it reasonably arguable that the IPCC had no authority to initiate such a study, given the absence of any express statutory investigative or fact-finding powers. “The report is intended to be submitted to the Chief Executive. If it turns out that the IPCC in fact does not have those requisite powers, the contents of the report may be tainted by materials obtained through processes which are outwith its powers,” Yeung said. Resignations from police watchdog’s protests review reveal system flaws 11 Dec 2019 Resignations from police watchdog’s protests review reveal system flaws 11 Dec 2019 He said priority would be given to the present case in light of its judicial importance and the engagement of the rule of law.  As to the legal basis for commencing the probe, the IPCC cited Section 8(2) of the Independent Police Complaints Council Ordinance, which said the council may do all things reasonably necessary for, or incidental or conducive to, the performance of its functions. Lui argued the legislature had never conferred investigative powers to the watchdog. The IPCC hit back by saying the lack of investigative powers was confined to specific complaints, but it still enjoyed incidental fact-finding powers.  Yeung eventually sided with the applicant after the first round of the legal battle, as he found the existence of incidental fact-finding powers, as suggested by the watchdog, required further inquiry.   The legal bid could pose another bombshell to the police watchdog, after a five-member international expert group announced earlier this month to “stand aside from its role” of helping the IPCC in its investigation. The expert group pointed out the IPCC lacked the powers and resources required to investigate the force’s conduct during protests. IPCC won’t let international experts comment on force’s conduct report 18 Dec 2019 IPCC won’t let international experts comment on force’s conduct report 18 Dec 2019 Hong Kong’s beleaguered government has relied on the IPCC as the key channel to hold police accountable since the unrest unfolded. It has dismissed protesters’ demand for an investigation by an independent committee with statutory powers to call for witnesses and evidence. In September, city leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor floated the idea of an independent review committee to look for the underlying causes of the unrest, but without any subpoena power. Lam floated the idea two months after the IPCC announced on July 2 it would launch a probe into the major clashes. It said in a statement its study aimed at laying the factual groundwork for it to discharge its functions effectively in handling complaints against police actions in protests. 	SCMP

On the global front, Black from Blackbox Research said the Hong Kong protests were also a “real hot button” issue with Singaporeans this year. More than 6,000 people in Hong Kong – 40 per cent of them students, including secondary school pupils – have been arrested in connection with the unrest, which was triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill but morphed into a broader anti-government campaign, with bouts of violence. About one-quarter of respondents rated the protests as the “top global event”. The Christchurch mosque shootings in March, which took more than 50 lives, came in second, followed by US President Donald Trump’s second meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

Protesters who gathered at Statue Square in Central criticised the police’s actions as suppression of the anti-government movement, which was sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill in early June. extradition bill Police revealed on Thursday that the force had frozen about HK$70 million raised by activists via Spark Alliance HK to support the city’s anti-government protesters and also arrested four people aged between 17 and 50 for money laundering. anti-government protesters Officers suspected the funds were used for personal gain and other illegal activities, including participation rewards for young demonstrators, an allegation a source connected to the fundraising platform denied. Apart from slogans to reiterate the demands like setting up an independent inquiry on police use of force during the protests, the demonstrators also chanted: “Support Spark Alliance, protect comrades”. Micky Chan, 39, who held a placard stating “evidence of illicit source for protest funds please”, questioned what evidence police had in stating that the financial source of Spark Alliance was illegal.  “[What police did] lacked evidence. This is quite obvious,” said Chan, who works in the financial sector. “I am worried that police would use the excuse that the case had entered legal proceedings and thus [could] not reveal more details about this case to the public, and freeze the funding for an unlimited period,” he said.

In Kowloon Bay, dozens of demonstrators including residents and office workers marched on streets around Exchange Tower, chanting “Stand with Spark Alliance! Protect Hong Kong!”. Several riot police officers in full gear followed the protesters and displayed a yellow warning flag, but did not disperse them with force.

But University station in Sha Tin will still have limited services, with some exits, turnstiles and display screens out of action, as MTR Corporation staff need more time to return the East Rail line stop to normal. The director behind the repair work said it was too early to estimate the bill for the work, saying only it would be “quite large”. He did not say whether the bill would be passed on to passengers or taxpayers, but commentators believe that unlikely as railway fares are governed by a rigid formula that does not take into account the cost of maintenance and repair work. “I hope everyone will refrain from damaging our facilities, to avoid the substantial cost and damage,” said Tony Lee Kar-yun, MTR Corp deputy operations director, on Friday. Inside the occupied Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus Inside the occupied Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus The East Rail line, running between Hung Hom and border terminals at Lok Ma Chau and Lo Wu, is a key artery connecting Kowloon with the northern New Territories.  The rail firm said last month that University station was so badly damaged that the restoration was no different to rebuilding it. During clashes between protesters and police at the nearby Chinese University campus in November, glass was shattered, communication facilities were destroyed, equipment was taken from the control room, and ticketing machines and turnstiles were trashed. The station was closed from November 12, one of several transport links damaged during the recent months of unrest, and will be the last to reopen.  Lee said the decision to open the station came after a joint assessment with various authorities. Chinese University’s Rocky Tuan named one of world’s most influential academics 19 Dec 2019 Chinese University’s Rocky Tuan named one of world’s most influential academics 19 Dec 2019 “Only basic services can be maintained during the initial phase of the reopening,” he said. “Please give us great tolerance.”  He said one of the station’s four exits, exit D, would remain closed on Saturday, while only some of the turnstiles at other exits would be available.  Platform screens displaying train destinations would remain unavailable, Lee said, meaning staff would hold signs instead. At least 50 staff members would be deployed to help passengers. I will urge everyone not to damage our facilities Tony Lee, MTR Corp deputy operations director A lift and the nearby lobby, which had their surfaces completely burnt off, leaving only a grey layer of cement, remained cordoned off. A customer services counter at the platform was seen without its glass shield. Lee said, however, that all the fire services facilities had been restored to comply with safety standards. He said about 200 technicians, at one point working day and night, had made repairs over the previous weeks. The station fell victim to vandalism and arson attacks during major clashes between protesters and police at the Chinese University campus, which ran for days. The MTR Corp has become a lightning rod for demonstrators’ fury during more than six months of anti-government unrest which has gripped the city. The protesters accuse the rail operator of colluding with police during the force’s clearance operations. As of November 24, radicals had caused extensive damage to 85 of 94 rail stations and 62 of 68 Light Rail stops. More than 1,900 turnstiles, 1,100 ticketing and top-up machines, 1,200 surveillance cameras, 202 lifts and escalators, as well as 190 roller shutters were damaged across all train stations in Hong Kong. Some 54 heavy railway trains and 16 Light Rail vehicles had also been damaged. The MTR Corp revealed last week that the loss related to restoration and repair of the damaged facilities amounted to HK$500 million. Lee said extra security measures had been added to protect the station when it was closed at night, but added there was no way to prevent people from throwing objects onto the uncovered track. “I would urge everyone not to damage our facilities,” he said. About 50 MTR station entrances to become fortresses to defend against further vandalism by Hong Kong protesters 4 Nov 2019 About 50 MTR station entrances to become fortresses to defend against further vandalism by Hong Kong protesters 4 Nov 2019 Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting, whose New Territories East constituency covers the station, said it was understandable the repair work has taken time, as he was told the rail operator had run out of some of the components needed to complete the work. “But this is definitely not what was suggested before, which was to rebuild the station,” he said. Pro-establishment lawmaker Michael Tien said MTR’s fare adjustment adhered strictly to a mechanism, which depended on inflation, staff wages and services performance. “MTR has no power to increase the fares,” said the former chairman of rail operator KCR, which ran the East Rail line before it merged with the MTR Corp in 2007. Former lawmaker Bill Tang Ka-piu, from the Federation of Trade Unions, said the government, which receives annual dividends from the listed train operator, might pocket less because the cost of damages might hurt MTR’s profits. Meanwhile, the MTR Corp said Yuen Long station would remain closed from 1pm on Saturday. Free shuttle bus services between Long Ping and Yuen Long stations will be arranged for passengers after 1pm. Anti-government protesters have planned a rally in Yuen Long on Saturday to commemorate the attack on train passengers by white-clad men on July 21. 	SCMP

Protesters held a rally on Friday near the banking giant’s headquarters to condemn the police crackdown, but supporters of the movement online were split on whether to “punish” HSBC for previously closing the account of fundraising platform Spark Alliance HK. The city’s largest bank was on the defensive a day after police arrested four people for allegedly laundering money for the second-largest pro-democracy funding platform, set up to help those arrested or jailed over the protests. While opposition lawmakers and some legal experts questioned the justification for the crackdown, a police insider pushed back, claiming prosecutors were not required to prove that actual proceeds of crime were involved. Police suspect the funds were used for personal gain and other illegal activities, including participation rewards for young protesters. All four arrested were released on bail on Thursday night, including a 50-year-old man listed as director of a shell company at the centre of most of the financial transactions. HSBC closed the account of “Prime Management Service Limited” in November. Police insiders said the account of the largely dormant company was reactivated around June, when it recorded more than 50,000 deposits totalling nearly HK$81 million, which led to their investigation in early October.  In a rare statement on Friday, HSBC, without stating names, explained its previous decision to shut down Spark Alliance’s account was only in accordance with international regulatory standards. “Our decision is completely unrelated to the Hong Kong police’s arrest of the four individuals on 19 December 2019,” the bank said. “We closed the account in November 2019 following direct instruction from the customer. As we previously stated, the account has not been used for its stated purpose … To reiterate, our decision to close the account is categorically unrelated to the current Hong Kong situation.” Police freeze HK$70 million raised by Spark Alliance for Hong Kong protesters 20 Dec 2019 Police freeze HK$70 million raised by Spark Alliance for Hong Kong protesters 20 Dec 2019   There were mixed reactions from the protest movement on whether to target the banking giant.  More than 100 people joined a peaceful lunchtime protest opposite HSBC’s headquarters to lend their support to Spark Alliance. “Support Spark Alliance, protect comrades!” they chanted, insisting police had no evidence to act against the fundraiser. Radical activists have previously vandalised and petrol-bombed branches and ATMs of state-owned Bank of China. Sunny Cheung Kwan-yang, former spokesman of lobbyist group Hong Kong Higher Education International Affairs Delegation, felt HSBC should pay the price for closing Spark Alliance’s account. “We hope the US Congress can use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to sanction HSBC which helped the autocratic Hong Kong regime to close down the bank account of a democratic foundation,” Cheung said in a Twitter post that was shared thousands of times. Thousands of comments flooded HSBC Hong Kong’s Facebook page, expressing anger and disappointment at the bank. “Simple yes/no question, have you reported to the police, and provided them with records?” wrote newly elected district councillor Timothy Lee Hin-long. Spark Alliance has condemned police for what it called a smear campaign. While police said the director who was arrested was the sole beneficiary of insurance products bought with the funds, raising concerns about donation money being misappropriated for personal gain, a source told the Post the insurance purchases were used purely to inject assets into the bank account to prevent its closure. Post Former legal sector lawmaker Margaret Ng Ngoi-yee, one of the trustees of the largest fundraising platform for the protests, the 612 Humanitarian Fund, expressed shock over the police crackdown and complained that evidence was lacking. “The government cannot stop volunteer lawyers from assisting frontline protesters, so they go and freeze the fund that is used to pay the lawyers,” she said, adding that using insurance as an investment package was not unheard of. HSBC to close corporate account being used to support protesters 19 Nov 2019 HSBC to close corporate account being used to support protesters 19 Nov 2019 But a police source said there was no need to prove actual criminal activity, citing the top court’s landmark 2016 ruling on businessman Carson Yeung Ka-sing’s money laundering case. “It held that it is unnecessary for the prosecution to prove the proceeds are in fact the proceeds of an indictable offence. It also reiterated that the proof of a predicate offence is not required,” the source said. The source cited the “large variety of counterparties, large transactions and incommensurate financial pattern” as forming the basis of the police case against Spark Alliance, with further charges of theft and fraud possible. A former money-laundering investigator suspected the fund included unsourced money disguised as crowdfunded donations. “The group was not registered and no audit and tax was needed,” he said. But veteran criminal defence lawyer Jonathan Midgley said prosecutors would still have to establish that the accused knew or reasonably believed the money they used were the proceeds of serious crime. Meanwhile, thousands of protesters gathered outside the Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre in the rain to show their support for the 79 people who have been held at the detention centre since the anti-government protests began in June. Organisers estimated 6,000 people had filled the pavement along Butterfly Valley Road and the surrounding side streets around the detention centre. Police said the crowd was 1,200 at its peak. Rally-goers remained peaceful and chanted slogans in support of arrested protesters. Family members and significant others of arrested protesters read letters from those being held in detention. The rally, organised by pro-democracy legislators and district councillors, had received a letter of no objection from the police. Lawmaker Fernando Cheung was among those who spoke. “The young protesters have given up their youth to fight for our freedom, and we are here to tell them we will not forget them,” he said.

But, pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung called the claims misleading, and said the world had seen how the law had been “selectively enforced” over the past six months. David Leung Cheuk-yin SC, the director of public prosecutions, hit back in the opening remarks of the Department of Justice’s annual report released on Thursday, and said he was saddened by such a suggestion. It was Leung’s most elaborate public remarks since almost 1,000 defendants were charged in court during the recent civil unrest, although the report mainly focused on prosecutors’ work in 2018, long before the ongoing anti-government protests erupted in June. Leung insisted the department’s role was to minister justice, and distanced his unit from law enforcement, including police officers accused of excessive use of force over the past six months. “We do not take instructions from law enforcement agencies,” he wrote. “They are not our clients or client departments. They carry out their investigative duties and submit all the available evidence to the Department of Justice.”  He said he “made no apologies” for reiterating that prosecutorial decisions were based on evidence and the public interest. “Our role is to ensure that every defendant receives a fair trial,” added the career prosecutor, who rose to the top job last year.  But student activist Wong, who was prosecuted over his involvement in the mass pro-democracy Occupy protest in 2014, called the director’s comments “misleading and irresponsible”.  “International media and Hongkongers have witnessed how police have selectively enforced the law in the past six months,” he said. First wave of alleged Hong Kong rioters released on bail with most handed curfew 1 Aug 2019 First wave of alleged Hong Kong rioters released on bail with most handed curfew 1 Aug 2019 Despite widespread accusations of use of unlawful force, he added, no police officers had been prosecuted. “That is the undeniable example of political prosecution,” he said.  In October, a prosecutor was subjected to verbal abuse after he objected to the bail application of a 15-year-old charged over the protest. Even before the protests, prosecutors had been under fire from both sides of the political spectrum. They were hated by pro-establishment supporters at one point for charging police officers over the handling of the 2014 unrest. And, in 2018, pro-democracy activists accused them of prosecuting with a political motives when the courts tried nine leaders from the same Occupy protests, and dozens of others who took part in a riot in Mong Kok in 2016. “I regret to note that some members of the public accused the prosecution of certain cases having a political factual background as ‘political prosecution’,” Leung wrote. Hong Kong protests: police arrested nearly 4,500 people since in June 18 Nov 2019 Hong Kong protests: police arrested nearly 4,500 people since in June 18 Nov 2019 But, on a more positive note, Leung said he had managed to increase the number of cases handled by in-house prosecutors by 11 per cent from 2017 to 3,730 cases. The number of cases outsourced to lawyers was down 19 per cent to 1,349 cases. Former director of prosecution Grenville Cross called it a “good sign”. “It means less reliance has to be placed on inexperienced private lawyers and greenhorns, which is a healthy development, particularly in the magistrates courts, where conviction rates have hovered at the 50 per cent level in recent years,” he said.

Latest figures from the bureau showed it received a total of 106 complaints of protest-related misconduct against teachers between June and November. Investigation was completed in about 60 cases and wrongdoings confirmed in 30. The pro-democracy Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union (PTU) said on Thursday about 20 teachers against whom such complaints were filed had sought its help over the past four months. About 17 of the cases were related to comments the teachers had made on social media, and nine have been found to be initially substantiated. The union said in five of the cases, the teachers did not get a chance to respond before being notified by the bureau that their cases had been substantiated, mostly on the basis of information provided by their respective schools. “The EDB has not been able to give fair treatment to people, allow them to understand the whole procedure and to make their statement before making its judgment,” education sector lawmaker and vice-president of the union Ip Kin-yuen said. The union said most of the 17 cases only involved the teachers’ personal comments, such as expressing their views on “police violence”, while in some cases there were “mild criticism”. Many of the comments were shared only with their social media friends, which were later used by the bureau as evidence.  Many teachers also told the union a lot of the complaints were made anonymously with the complainants identifying themselves as “a parent of an alumnus of the school” or “a concerned citizen”. The union found it “inappropriate and unfair” as it felt the teachers should also know who were making the complaints. Hong Kong protests: arrested teacher suspended following appeal from government 12 Dec 2019 Hong Kong protests: arrested teacher suspended following appeal from government 12 Dec 2019 Wong Kwan-yu, president of the pro-establishment Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers, said the group had not received any request from the teachers for help. He also agreed it would be “ideal” if the teachers were given a chance to respond before the bureau decided whether their cases could be substantiated or not. But he said the teachers could appeal following the existing mechanisms if they found the ruling unfair. The bureau earlier said follow-up actions were yet to be decided for most of the cases in which they found wrongdoings. The actions could include issuance of warnings, reprimands or even deregistration.  It said in a reply on Thursday that teachers had “abundant opportunities” to ­respond to the allegations, as the schools should provide their ­explanations while forwarding to it any complaint of wrongdoings. Police caution against rise in arrests of students over anti-government protests 28 Sep 2019 Police caution against rise in arrests of students over anti-government protests 28 Sep 2019 Separately, Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung issued a letter to teachers, students and parents on Thursday, sending season’s greetings, while adding he was “saddened and worried” by the arrests of students and teachers in protest-related offences.  Yeung also said in the letter that complaints about teachers’ professional misconduct would be seriously followed up and deregistration would be considered where the nature of the case was found to be serious enough. He took the occasion to reiterate to students they should not organise or take part in activities expressing any kind of political stance, including chanting slogans and forming human chains in schools.

Lau Ka-chun, 26, pleaded guilty to one count of possessing offensive weapons in a public place, after he was found in possession of a dagger, an axe, a machete, and a military knife in Yuen Long on September 21. His lawyer Jessica Chan Wing-yin told Tuen Mun Court her client did not own the weapons, but instead kept them for a protester temporarily to “do him a favour”. She said no fingerprints had been found on the dangerous items seized. But acting Principal Magistrate Cheung Kit-yee did not believe that argument, and said Lau could have handled the weapons using gloves or a cloth. She said the defendant might have used the weapons if necessary. The sentence was by far the heaviest handed down in protest-related proceedings since the anti-government movement swept Hong Kong in June. The court heard that Lau and about 100 protesters gathered at the junction of Fung Kam Street and Fung Yau Street North and chanted slogans at 9.50pm on September 21. Lau was later intercepted and arrested by police during a clean-up operation.  Chan pleaded for leniency on the basis of a positive background report, which said Lau had a good character and was sorry for what he had done. In assessing Lau’s sentence, Cheung set a starting point of 21 months in jail given the serious nature of the offence. She reduced it to 12 months to reflect Lau’s guilty plea and good background.

33	https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3042855/hong-kong-police-unions-fight-back-lawmakers-attempt-deny	2019-12-19	Hong Kong police unions fight back at lawmakers’ attempt to deny officers a pay rise	Two major unions representing Hong Kong police officers have expressed outrage over calls to exclude the force from the annual pay rise review for civil servants. The Disciplined Services Consultative Council (DSCC), and the Junior Police Officers’ Association (JPOA) have increased pressure on pan-democrats, a day before the Legislative Council’s Finance Committee resumes its scrutiny over the funding application for the pay rise concerning more than 176,000 civil servants on Friday. The pro-democracy bloc, backed by almost 400 newly elected district councillors from the same camp, earlier issued a joint letter asking the government to remove police from the funding request. The two unions, who had earlier sent letters to the committee, said on Thursday the proposed arrangement would undermine the force’s efforts to protect life and property in a city rocked by six months of anti-government protests. “As procedural justice is always on the lips of pan-democrats, they should stick to the established mechanism and not let their political stance override the benefits for civil servants,” said Lam Chi-wai, chairman of the JPOA. The existing annual civil service pay adjustment mechanism hinges on six factors, including the net pay trend, the economy, and public servants’ morale. DSCC’s acting chairwoman, Bonnie Lo Hoi-sze, said the performance of individual disciplined services should not be considered.  But she refused to comment on the HK$950 million (US$122 million) overtime allowance granted to 11,000 police officers since the start of the civil unrest in June. In a written reply to the legislature, the Civil Service Bureau revealed the payroll expenses for the force had reached HK$7.95 billion (US$1 billion) in November.   If the proposed pay rise was approved, an estimated HK$410 million in back-payment in salary – and another HK$50 million in back-payment of overtime allowance – would be required, it added. Civic Party lawmaker Jeremy Tam Man-ho rejected Lam’s argument, and said the attempt to block a pay rise for law enforcement was in line with public opinion, and abided by procedural rules in Legco.  Also on Thursday, Citizens’ Press Conference, a group which claims to represent protesters, released an online survey of what it said was more than 63,000 respondents, which found more than 99 per cent opposed a pay rise for police, while 92 per cent agreed to have the force excluded from the review.

Xi Jinping On the second day of his three-day visit in the casino hub to mark the 20th anniversary of its return from Portuguese to Chinese rule, Xi praised the city’s residents for putting their love of the country and Macau before the core values of democracy, rule of law, human rights and freedom. He also complimented the Macau government for understanding the importance of harmony, unity and consultation, as well as avoiding disputes and internal friction. While he made no mention of Hong Kong, his remarks were once again interpreted as a rebuke of the former British colony which has been rocked by anti-government and anti-Beijing protests since June. Analysts said it was clear Xi was deliberately contrasting his strong approval of Macau with his silent disapproval of Hong Kong ’s performance in integrating with the motherland since its 1997 return to Chinese sovereignty. protests The Hong Kong government revealed on Thursday night that Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor had led a delegation of her officials to meet the president. Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor According to the official Xinhua news agency, Xi fully acknowledged her commitment and courage in these “unusual times”. Lam informed him she would work on restoring public order in Hong Kong as soon as possible. Xi heaps praise on Macau as he begins handover anniversary visit 18 Dec 2019 Xi heaps praise on Macau as he begins handover anniversary visit 18 Dec 2019 When Lam met Xi earlier this week in Beijing, Xinhua reported, she told him of her plans and was offered full support. Lam met Xi earlier this week  Addressing about 150 people from all walks of life, including government officials, at the Macau East Asian Games Dome, Xi said: “I hope you can take a clear-cut stand on major matters of principle and sound out positive voices, and become the strong backup force for the chief executive and the government to govern in accordance with the law. “I hope all of you continue to steadfastly support the chief executive and the special administrative region government and give full support to it to implement reform and resolve thorny issues.” The Chinese leader, visiting Macau for the second time since 2014, is expected to announce new policies aimed at diversifying the casino hub’s gaming-dependent economy and developing it into an international financial centre. Heightened security for his visit has seen activists and journalists from Hong Kong being barred entry this week. Heightened security Xi Jinping praises Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam over handling of protest crisis Xi Jinping praises Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam over handling of protest crisis Xi urged Macau, which was run by the Portuguese until December 1999, to find new growth points in its economy, while promoting inclusiveness and unity to build an even more stable and harmonious city.  He said he was proud of Macau’s development over the past two decades, pointing to the 36 million visitor arrivals last year and its per capita GDP of more than US$80,000, the second highest in the world.  Macau’s economy is heavily reliant on its casino industry. Last year, about 80 per cent of the government’s revenue came from gaming tax. Delivering another speech at a dinner banquet, Xi praised Macau for forming a national security committee last year and for passing its national security bill under Article 23 of the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution. Macau saw no large-scale protests when the bill was passed in 2009, unlike in Hong Kong when the government tried to do the same in 2003 and was forced to give up after half a million people took to the streets, fearing their rights and freedoms would be undermined. No problem with mainland officers holding Macau-bound Hongkonger, says Cheung 17 Dec 2019 No problem with mainland officers holding Macau-bound Hongkonger, says Cheung 17 Dec 2019 “Loving the country and loving Macau has become the core value of the entire society. The government and people from all walks of lives understand that Macau’s future and fate are connected with that of the motherland,” Xi said. He applauded the Macau government for implementing “patriotic education” in schools, saying it allowed them to pass on the torch of patriotism and deepened their understanding of the “one country, two systems” principle. Primary and secondary schools as well as universities in Macau, Xi noted, provided classes on China’s constitution and the Basic Law under the one country, two systems principle, which also applies to Hong Kong and promises the two cities a high degree of autonomy. Xi declared that Macau’s executive-led political system had been running smoothly. Macau-based commentator Larry So Man-yum said Xi was giving Hong Kong a lecture without naming the city. This was especially apparent when Xi talked about the importance of harmony and love for the country, So said. “Xi was telling Hong Kong what a good boy should be like, and that if Hong Kong could do everything that Macau has done, then Xi would consider it a good boy, too,” So said. Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of semi-official think tank the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said Xi had used Macau’s experience to illustrate what was meant by full and accurate implementation of the one country, two systems policy. The political turmoil in recent months is more proof of Hong Kong falling short of the central government’s expectations Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies “In my memory, state leaders have never spelt out the criteria of full and accurate implementation of one country, two systems in such a detailed manner,” Lau said. “In terms of respect for the central government’s authority and the operation of executive-led government, Hong Kong has a long way to go to catch up with the achievements made by Macau. The political turmoil in Hong Kong in recent months is more proof of Hong Kong falling short of the central government’s expectations.” Lau said he expected both the Beijing and Hong Kong governments to take steps in the years ahead to rectify the situation in Hong Kong. “Otherwise, it wouldn’t be good for Hong Kong and the central government,” he said. Outgoing Macau Chief Executive Fernando Chui Sai-on said the casino hub had shown the world that one country, two systems was working and supported by the people. 	SCMP

Officers suspect the funds were used for personal gain and other illegal activities, including participation rewards for young demonstrators. Hong Kong’s anti-government protesters A police insider said that initial investigations indicated dozens of teenagers were paid thousands of dollars each through fundraising platform Spark Alliance HK to join protests, an allegation a source connected to the group strongly denied. Acting senior superintendent Chan Wai-kei of the Narcotics Bureau’s financial investigation unit said the four, aged between 17 and 50, were arrested during a raid on Thursday. Officers seized HK$130,000 in cash and a receipt for HK$165,000 spent on supermarket coupons, two laser pointers, six arrows and a large amount of protest gear such as helmets and gas masks. Spark Alliance, set up after the 2016 Mong Kok riot to help arrested or jailed activists, had crowdfunded about HK$80 million over the past six months. But police said they had come across suspicious financial transactions, including large amounts spent on personal insurance products. HSBC to close corporate account being used to support protesters 19 Nov 2019 HSBC to close corporate account being used to support protesters 19 Nov 2019 “We also do not exclude the possibility that the funds were used as a reward to encourage teens to come out and join the civil unrest,” Chan said. The suspects – three men and a woman – were identified as a student, two clerical workers and a human resources manager.  Officers started investigating a shell company behind the crowdfunding effort after finding its financial transactions suspicious. One of the suspects, a 50-year-old man listed as the director of the company, was the only beneficiary of the personal insurance products bought with the donations.  “Purchasing such products raises suspicions as the group did not say they were collecting funds for investments. The amount is huge as well,” Chan said, adding that the shell company had not paid taxes over the past few years.   “This could involve crimes related to money laundering,” Chan said. He added that the platform had used the funds to pay some arrested protesters, and that anyone who dealt with the possible crime proceeds could be deemed to be involved in money laundering. Spark Alliance confirmed the arrests hours later, saying all “comrades” were receiving legal support. “We condemn the police attempt to use false representation to smear our platform as being involved in evil purposes like money laundering,” it said in a Facebook post. We condemn the police attempt to use false representation to smear our platform Spark Alliance In November, the group announced that HSBC had suspended its account, after the bank found its activities failed to match business purposes as originally stated. A police investigator with experience in money-laundering cases said people could easily commit an offence if they did not ask about the source of funds, or if they turned a blind eye to the source and dealt with such amounts. “If one day someone gave you HK$10 million out of the blue and asked you to transfer it into 10 bank accounts, or to buy an insurance product or even protection gear, you could be deemed as laundering money even if you did not ask where it was from,” the source said. “Therefore all banks or money service operators are highly alert and will shut down some accounts as they do not want to get involved.” Website offers up to HK$1 million for help to track down suspects in protests 28 Aug 2019 Website offers up to HK$1 million for help to track down suspects in protests 28 Aug 2019 But veteran criminal defence lawyer Christopher Morley said such arrests on the grounds of money laundering might be a “bit of a stretch”. “If police want to proceed with a prosecution, they would have to establish that the persons being charged had reasonable grounds to believe that they were handling money from crime proceeds,” he said. But he added the arrests might lead to investigations into whether the group was involved in inciting or aiding and abetting criminal activities. Under the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance, those convicted of money-laundering charges face a maximum penalty of 14 years behind bars and a HK$5 million fine. A 16-year-old frontline protester, who only gave his name as Bosco, accused police of trying to frame Spark Alliance. “Police are deliberately trying to weaken such platforms so protesters would not be able to receive any help,” the high school student said. A 24-year-old construction worker and hard-core protester, who only identified himself as K, said the platform would not stop because of the police action. “It is an important platform as even the parents [of protesters] know that they should contact Spark Alliance if their children are arrested,” he said. “They would become lost without help from the group.” Spark Alliance is the second-largest crowdfunding platform for the protests, but it has not publicly disclosed its financial statements or amount of donations received. The largest platform is 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund, whose founders include former lawmaker Margaret Ng Ngoi-yee, Canto-pop singer Denise Ho Wan-sze, and retired cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun. That fund said it had raised HK$97.1 million as of November 30 and helped 6,946 people while spending HK$23.3 million, mostly for direct economic aid or legal and medical needs involving protesters.

The same group, Social Welfare Sector Strike Committee, was behind a three-day strike in the sector that began on Tuesday in support of the ongoing anti-government protests. Speaking before the march set off at 2.30pm, committee member and social worker Doris Leung called on more countries to make laws over the human rights situation in Hong Kong. “We hope leaders of various countries can pass … acts so to sanction Chinese and Hong Kong officials that erode human rights in Hong Kong,” Leung said. The United States has already passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act that allows the State Department to sanction individuals deemed to have undermined the city’s autonomy. Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act The act also allows Washington to suspend Hong Kong’s special trading status based on an annual certification by the department about whether the city retains a sufficient degree of autonomy under the “one country, two systems” framework.  Marchers submitted petition letters at eight consulates, including that of Canada, Japan and the US, as well as the European Union’s office in the city. The march spilled out onto roads and came to a halt at around 3.30pm after reaching Justice Drive.  Riot police asked the crowd to return to the pavement to continue their march but some protesters did not budge.  After a mild confrontation lasting about an hour, the remaining crowd was allowed to continue walking along the road. The committee said more than 1,000 people attended the Thursday afternoon march, which was followed by a rally at Edinburgh Place, Central the same night, which organisers said was attended by about 1,500. At the rally, the committee said more than 2,000 social welfare workers from some 40 organisations were involved in the three-day strike. “If the adults are willing to go on strike, the young would not need to clash with police,” the crowd chanted on their way from Wan Chai to Central. More than 6,000 people have been arrested since the protests over the now-withdrawn extradition bill began in early June. About 40 per cent of them are students. A social worker in his 40s, who called himself KK, had been on strike for three days. “Most social workers are peaceful, rational and non-violent, if we are united, we can do more [for the protest movement],” he said. He believed the three-day strike was effective in enhancing unity within the sector for future industrial actions. “The number of people on strike [this time] does not need to be huge, it is only the start,” he said. Donald Trump signs Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act into law 28 Nov 2019 Donald Trump signs Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act into law 28 Nov 2019 A 37-year-old social worker who worked with young people, and spoke on condition of anonymity, said she believed striking was a peaceful and effective way to put pressure on the government in responding to protesters’ demands. “Although there isn’t an economic impact, we want to tell Hongkongers that we do not want the young people to [take radical actions] on behalf of us,” she said. She said clashing with police would not bring long-term change to society, and added: “We should take aim at the government.” The Social Welfare Department said only a small number of government-subsidised services were affected by the strike. “The service units concerned have made contingency arrangements by, for instance, rearranging activities to other date, and have informed their service clients concerned,” the department said. Separately, Democratic Party lawmaker Ted Hui Chi-fung has kick-started a HK$3.3 million crowdfunding campaign to launch legal actions against alleged police brutality. Those involved hope to launch private prosecutions against the police officer who shot a student in the chest in Tsuen Wan on October 1, and another who drove into a crowd of protesters in Kwai Fong on November 11. They also plan to apply for a civil injunction to stop the force from using mainland-made tear gas canisters. 	SCMP

No, says pro-Beijing lawmakers who vote down bid by opposition	Pro-establishment lawmakers in Hong Kong on Thursday blocked a proposal by the opposition to invoke special legislative powers to investigate alleged brutality in police’s handling of protests, saying it was “inappropriate” to single out the force. But a member of the camp, Liberal Party’s Peter Shiu Ka-fai also offered a public apology during the five-hour debate, for allowing the administration to press ahead with the hated extradition bill before it was suspended in June. The bill, which sparked the ongoing social unrest, would have allowed for the transfer of fugitives to jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no such agreement, including mainland China. Pro-democracy lawmakers in push to invoke special Legco powers for police probe 19 Dec 2019 Pro-democracy lawmakers in push to invoke special Legco powers for police probe 19 Dec 2019 On Thursday, three motions centred on police action on June 12 – when tens of thousands protested outside the Legislative Council – were all voted down following a debate among lawmakers in both the geographical and functional constituencies. The pro-government bloc holds a majority of seats in both categories. The June 12 incident involved protesters trying to disrupt the second reading of the extradition bill in Legco, leading to police declaring the event a riot and firing hundreds of tear gas rounds, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds to disperse crowds.  Pro-establishment lawmakers who spoke on Thursday said they believed it was inappropriate to use Legco powers to single out police and investigate their actions on a particular date. “The alleged police brutality on June 12 was a result of provocative actions by protesters. Why doesn’t the opposition call for a probe into their violence as well?” Junius Ho Kwan-yiu, a hate figure for the movement, argued. Why doesn’t the opposition call for a probe into [protesters’] violence as well? Junius Ho, lawmaker The Liberal Party, though sharing similar views, was the only group from the bloc which apologised for “non-action” despite strong public opposition against the bill before it escalated into a full-blown political crisis.  “We cannot shrug off our responsibilities for letting the administration proceed with the bill that aroused deep concerns in society,” Shiu of the pro-business party said. “We must apologise for that.”  Three days ahead of the clashes on June 12, an estimated 1 million people had taken to the streets in a protest march. We cannot shrug off our responsibilities for letting the administration proceed with the bill Peter Shiu, Liberal Party member The three motions put forth by pan-democrats called for a select committee under the Legislative Council (Power and Privileges) Ordinance, and to summon the police commissioner to give evidence on the force’s handling of protests. “As both the Independent Police Complaints Council and the government’s independent review committee do not have investigative capabilities, Legco should exercise its powers to step in,” Council Front lawmaker Eddie Chu Hoi-dick said. Deputy security minister Sonny Au Chi-kwong defended police in the debate, urging the public to allow time and space for the force’s watchdog to complete its thematic study due to the complexities of cases. The pro-Beijing camp won the vote on the motions by a narrow margin in the geographical constituency 16-14, after pan-democrats Au Nok-hin and Gary Fan Kwok-wai were unseated on Tuesday as the city’s top court refused to let them challenge lower court rulings that declared their elected positions invalid. Meanwhile, Legco will resume on January 8 to discuss the necessity of setting up an investigation into an attack on civilians and protesters by a white-clad mob at Yuen Long MTR station on July 21. Police were accused of showing up late to restore order as thugs with wooden sticks and metal rods assaulted people. Lawmakers will also vote on whether inquiries should be set up for a controversial police clearance operation inside Prince Edward MTR station on August 31, and the general policing of recent protests.

But the child, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was made subject to a care or protection order that imposes a curfew and compels him to take part in social activities as directed by the Social Welfare Department (SWD) for two years. The boy pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal damage at a previous hearing on November 21, after a plain-clothes police officer spotted him vandalising the wall of Mong Kok Police Station and Prince Edward MTR station on October 3. Boy, 12, is youngest to be convicted over Hong Kong protests 21 Nov 2019 Boy, 12, is youngest to be convicted over Hong Kong protests 21 Nov 2019 At West Kowloon court, Magistrate Pang Leung-ting ordered the removal of the charges against the child – a power granted to the Juvenile Court under section 15 of the Juvenile Offenders Ordinance – because of his good background and the less serious nature of the offences. The ruling means the boy avoids having a criminal record. The defendant was the youngest to plead guilty in court among more than 980 suspects charged in protest-related proceedings since this year’s outbreak of demonstrations.  Police revealed on Monday that 6,105 people had been arrested over the anti-government protests, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, since the first mass demonstration was staged on June 9. Of all those arrested, 2,430 people, or 39.8 per cent, were students. The 12-year-old was brought to court after a police officer in plain clothing saw him at 7.30pm on October 3 in a mask spraying “damn rogue cops” with black point on the wall of Mong Kok Police Station, alongside an obscenity about force families.  The officer tailed the boy to Prince Edward MTR station, where the minor sprayed “divine annihilation, free HK” on the wall of exit B1.  The boy was traced to his residence by the officer, who waited outside until 7am the following day, when the boy went to school in uniform. When he was intercepted and taken back to his home, a police search found a bottle of black paint and clothing, which officers seized.   In interviews under caution, the boy, accompanied by his grandmother, said he committed the offences alone and was remorseful. On Thursday, defence lawyer Jacqueline Lam described “very positive” probation and social welfare reports on the boy, who had support from his family and relatives in court. Mass arrests of Hong Kong protesters ‘could radicalise’ peaceful marchers 3 Sep 2019 Mass arrests of Hong Kong protesters ‘could radicalise’ peaceful marchers 3 Sep 2019 She urged Pang for leniency, saying painting graffiti was less serious than similar acts of criminal damage. “He knows that he used an inappropriate method [to express his views]. He has learnt his lesson,” Lam said. The boy confirmed to Pang that he had committed the crimes under the influence of other unknown protesters. He promised he would not be swayed by others in future. Pang accepted the recommendation made by the SWD officer and placed him under a care or protection order with immediate effect. Under the order, the boy is committed to the care of his grandmother, with whom he has been residing since his parents’ divorce. During a two-year period, the boy must stay at home every night between 7pm and 6am, and follow the instructions of the SWD officer in joining various activities. The court will hear a progress report of the boy on June 18 next year. 	SCMP

He said the weapons seized from inside the campus were the most “frenziedly designed” he had ever seen in his 37 years of service. long-drawn-out battle with anti-government protesters “Did anyone want to leave the premises which we disallowed? No,” Cheuk said. “Did anyone need medical attention which we refused? No. “If they wanted to walk out without consequence, then it has nothing to do with humanity but the rule of law,” he said, rebutting claims police trapped protesters for almost two weeks and denied them basic supplies. Critics including former chief secretary Anson Chan Fang On-shan described the situation as a “humanitarian crisis”.  Some protesters tried to escape down a filthy drainage pipe while others abseiled from a bridge to motorbikes waiting below. “If we allow anyone to walk free after they have trashed a beautiful university, the surrounding area and the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, then it is a crisis for the city’s rule of law,” Cheuk said.  According to the assistant police commander, around 1,500 protesters left the campus in the end. Among them, around 800 adults were arrested and about 400 people were sent to hospital without being arrested on the spot.  He said police were still investigating 324 minors who had their details recorded before being let go. None of the protesters who walked out from PolyU had been prosecuted yet. “Helping these minors, most of whom were still in secondary school, leave such a dangerous place and get home safely, might be one of the most meaningful things I did during the crazy days of the past six months,” Cheuk said. After searching the campus for evidence and removing hazardous items, police seized a total of 3,989 petrol bombs, 1,339 pieces of explosives and 601 bottles of corrosive liquid, alongside 573 other items classified as weapons. These included hammers, air guns, 28 bows and about 200 arrows and 12 giant catapults used to launch bricks. police seized a total of 3,989 petrol bombs Police earlier described an “assembly line” to make and transfer petrol bombs inside PolyU. What caught Cheuk’s eye was a large canister rounded by sharp nails. Hong Kong's PolyU siege : From beginning to end Hong Kong's PolyU siege : From beginning to end “I have never seen such large quantities of weapons, not to mention such frenziedly designed weapons.” The siege began on November 17 after pitched battles between protesters hurling petrol bombs and police responding with tear gas turned the campus entrance into a war zone. Police sealed the exits and asked all those inside to leave with more petrol bombs thrown, including many which set a force armoured car alight. An officer was also shot in the leg by an arrow from a bow. “The most difficult time was the following dawn,” Cheuk said. Inside the besieged Hong Kong Polytechnic University Inside the besieged Hong Kong Polytechnic University “I felt everyone had just reached madness. Petrol bombs were passed on by human chains and some even bought beer in a convenience store to make more on the spot. Countless petrol bombs were hurled at us,” Cheuk recalled. The veteran who joined the force aged 17 and spent years battling against Triads, said it was saddening to see protesters take justice into their own hands and trash shops that had opposing views to them. “I can’t see how the unlawfulness links to the five demands. The attacks are cruel … They trashed shops during business hours. Is there any difference with triad activities? Maybe the protesters are even worse.” 	SCMP

Ronald Lam Siu-por, Cathay Pacific’s chief customer and commercial officer, said November was “very challenging” for the airline, and travel sentiments were “still weak”. “Overall, our expectation is that the rest of 2019 will remain incredibly challenging,” Lam said. Cathay Pacific Airways offers lifeline to pilots at troubled Hong Kong Airlines Cathay Pacific Airways offers lifeline to pilots at troubled Hong Kong Airlines 12 Dec 2019 “We continue to see a significant shortfall in inbound advance bookings for Hong Kong, particularly from mainland China and other regional markets, as compared to the same period last year. This shortfall has been partially offset by the improvement in transit passenger traffic,” he added. Hong Kong’s flagship airline earlier said its profit expectations in the second half of 2019 would be “significantly” less than that of the first half. Cathay’s year-on-year inbound traffic shrank 46 per cent in November, which was followed by a 35 per cent shrinkage in October. In August and September, the year-on-year contraction of inbound traffic was 38 per cent.  The airline's pivot to transit traffic – which makes up almost half of its passenger mix – to shore up its business appears to be working. Hong Kong International Airport said on Sunday it handled 5.02 million passengers in November this year, some 969,000 fewer than November last year.

Cathay’s outbound traffic from Hong Kong fell by 8 per cent in November, which was only a slight improvement from that of October, the company said.  Mainland China continued to be a major problem for Cathay in the wake of the citywide protests and the punishment from the mainland’s aviation regulator on safety grounds. Cathay’s employees who supported the protests were not allowed to work on mainland-bound flights. The airline’s management has also been overhauled. 	SCMP

The activists gathered in Edinburgh Place in support of anti-government protesters and to condemn police’s handling of the demonstrations during six months of unrest. A strike committee from the social welfare sector, which is made up of union members and concern groups, had organised for the industrial action to run from Tuesday to Thursday. Patrick Lam, an occupational therapist and one of the strike’s organisers, encouraged people across different sectors to set up trade unions and hold demonstrations to hammer home protesters’ five demands, which include a judge-led inquiry into police conduct. Hong Kong principal wants amnesty for protest-related arrests, on both sides 20 Dec 2019 Hong Kong principal wants amnesty for protest-related arrests, on both sides 20 Dec 2019 “The social welfare sector works for the people and we treasure the value of human beings,” Lam said. “We really want to show the government and the world that we are very concerned about the escalating police violence and the tightening of basic personal freedoms.”  Away from the action in Central, regular lunchtime protests took place in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon Bay, Kwai Chung, Sha Tin and Tai Koo, with dozens gathering in each location. Hong Kong has been gripped since June by anti-government protests, initially triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. Violent clashes have escalated between protesters and police, resulting in more than 6,000 arrests, nearly 40 per cent of which involved students. Khalio Fung, a social worker for young people who decided to join the strike in solidarity with the city’s youth, especially those injured or arrested in the protests, said a successful strike would show that the movement had not lost momentum.  However, he said it might not be enough to force the government to deliver concrete responses to protesters’ demands.  Tsang Koon-wing, who works with poor families and new immigrants with the Caritas Social Work Services Division, said social workers must “reach out to our communities and people from all walks of life to have a political dialogue”. Police receive 1,200 complaints over handling of Hong Kong protests 28 Nov 2019 Police receive 1,200 complaints over handling of Hong Kong protests 28 Nov 2019 “We all have different political stances but we can all represent the demands from different socio-economic backgrounds to the government,” he added. Before the rally, the Social Welfare Department contacted some community centres and NGOs asking how many social workers were expected to join the strike and whether day-to-day services would be affected. Tsang, a social worker of 28 years, said that while he understood the department had to ensure basic services remained in place, he was concerned that monitoring from the government could pose a political risk for social workers.   At 1.15pm, another social worker, Tonica Wong, led those gathered at Edinburgh Place for a period of silence to unite with protesters and young people involved in violent clashes this year. Police have repeatedly defended their response to the protests, saying they have used “minimum force” to clear protesters who have engaged in violence, vandalism and unlawful assembly. Nearly US$128 million spent on police overtime pay since protests broke out 13 Dec 2019 Nearly US$128 million spent on police overtime pay since protests broke out 13 Dec 2019 During the ongoing protests, hard-core elements of the movement have vandalised and started fires at railway stations and universities, while also targeting businesses with links to mainland China and setting roadblocks on major thoroughfares. Separately, the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, which operates 18 secondary schools, said on Tuesday that its schools had started to issue letters to parents this week reminding them to look after their children during the holidays and to prevent them from doing things which could “cause a nuisance or affect the interests of others”. In a letter issued by one Tung Wah school, students were also urged not to “participate in illegal activities or any radical acts in uniform” during Christmas and the new year holidays, as it would “bring negative impact to themselves as well as their school”. Last month, five students from one Tung Wah secondary school were penalised after they blocked train doors to disrupt public transport amid calls for a citywide strike. 	SCMP

Teddy Tang Chun-keung, a secondary-school principal of more than 25 years, told the Post the experience at the Hung Hom campus had left him heartbroken, and made him see the importance of finding common ground to resolve the ongoing political crisis. Post “We have seen people from both sides of the political divide breaking the law since protests erupted. When we talk about [an amnesty] and a pardon, it’s not targeting just one side,” Tang said, referring also to the arrests of some pro-government supporters who clashed with protesters, or even police officers being accused of using excessive force. He was among those who liaised with police and led more than 100 principals, teachers and social workers to PolyU, where they eventually persuaded 300 underage students to leave the cordoned site safely, after securing a deal with officers that minors would not be arrested immediately. It has been one month since police first surrounded PolyU on November 17, declaring the unrest a riot after protesters blocked roads and set fires nearby, which led to violent clashes between radicals and police. More than 1,000 hard-core protesters and their supporters were inside when police surrounded the campus.  According to police, apart from the 300 underage students, more than 800 people were arrested when they left or tried to escape from the university. Nearly 4,000 petrol bombs were later found on the campus. Tang, who assumed the role of chairman of the Hong Kong Association of the Heads of Secondary Schools last year, said he felt relieved that the PolyU siege had come to an end peacefully, but believed “a tragedy like that should not happen again”. Hong Kong protests: battered Polytechnic University faces six months of repairs 30 Nov 2019 Hong Kong protests: battered Polytechnic University faces six months of repairs 30 Nov 2019 The 59-year-old said it was on November 18 – a day after the siege began – when some secondary school principals started to receive messages from parents saying their children remained inside PolyU. As head of the association, Tang was also asked to recruit other principals to help by education sector lawmaker Ip Kin-yuen.  “We just wanted to safely bring these students out because we received so many messages for help,” Tang said.  While the principal successfully persuaded some 200 minors to leave on the first night, Tang also said it was the same evening he saw a father walk out with his son and daughter, both secondary school students. “He [the father] was immediately taken away, separated from his two children. The two kids looked terrified,” he said. “It was really upsetting to see young children having to witness their own parent getting arrested – a tragedy which should never have happened.” Tang said the adults who insisted on staying behind were of different ages and occupations, and he believed they would have been law-abiding individuals under normal circumstances. “Shouldn’t we rethink whether this is really a mere problem of law and order, or whether it is more of a political issue?” Tang said. He said the PolyU experience suggested common ground was needed to resolve the crisis, and officials should consider granting an amnesty or pardoning those arrested or convicted over the protests. Former association head Lee Suet-ying, also among those who went inside PolyU to help during the siege, agreed that an amnesty could be granted after considering factors such as age, motive and past criminal records. While granting an amnesty is among protesters’ five key demands, the government has rejected it, saying it goes against the rule of law. Latest police figures show that more than 6,000 people have been arrested in connection with the protests over the past six months, and nearly 40 per cent were students. 	SCMP

China’s domestic security chief was a surprise attendee at Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s meeting with President Xi Jinping on Monday, underscoring Beijing’s growing unease about national security in the city. Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s meeting with President Xi Jinping Monday’s meeting was part of the city leader’s annual duty trip to brief the president, an event at which the president is usually joined by a group of top Beijing officials overseeing Hong Kong and Macau. This time, the group included Vice-Premier Han Zheng, the top Communist Party leader on the two cities’ affairs; foreign affairs chief Yang Jiechi; United Front Work Department head You Quan; Xi’s chief of staff Ding Xuexiang; Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Zhang Xiaoming; and Wang Zhimin, the head of central government’s liaison office in Hong Kong. But Guo Shengkun, the head of the party’s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, was also present. Guo Shengkun Like Yang and Ding, Guo is one of the 25 members of the decision-making Politburo, but he also oversees China’s police force, spy agency, prosecutors and judiciary.  His attendance comes three months after Guo’s subordinate, Minister of Public Security Zhao Kezhi, made a similarly unexpected appearance at a meeting between Xi and Macau’s new leader, Ho Iat-seng. Minister of Public Security Zhao Kezhi, made a similarly unexpected appearance One source familiar with the duty visit’s arrangements said Guo had led an inter-agency rapid-response team set up in Shenzhen to monitor Hong Kong’s anti-government protests, now in their sixth month.  Observers said that Guo’s attendance – his first at such a meeting – spoke volumes about the attention Beijing was paying to Hong Kong’s police and law enforcement.  Li Xiaobing, a law professor at Nankai University in Tianjin, said Guo’s presence was probably related to coordination between security agencies in Beijing and Hong Kong. “Efforts to end the city’s violence are still under way and [Carrie Lam’s] briefing would naturally touch on the Hong Kong government and police work in this area … as well as how to coordinate with the central government,” Li said. “Thus Guo’s attendance probably has this consideration.” Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping’ protests in several malls across city lead to vandalism of outlets and clashes 16 Dec 2019 Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping’ protests in several malls across city lead to vandalism of outlets and clashes 16 Dec 2019 Gu Su, a political scientist at Nanjing University, said Guo’s presence might also reflect Beijing’s concerns about “foreign interference” in the city’s affairs. “The Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission also oversees the national security apparatus,” Gu said. “They might look into things related to foreign entities, like US groups of NGOs travelling to the city.” During the Monday meeting, Xi also stressed that China would resolutely oppose foreign forces that sought to interfere in the city’s affairs. It was unclear from the official accounts of the meeting whether Guo and Lam had any exchanges. Guo was also present at a senior-level symposium to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the handover of Macau earlier this month. Xi is visiting Macau this weekend to mark the anniversary. In a key party meeting in October, Beijing called on Hong Kong to enact a national security law, and introduce a law enforcement mechanism for national security. 	SCMP

The Tuen Mun Court heard that Chui Tin-lok, 27, who worked at SKH St Simon’s Lui Ming Choi Secondary School in Tuen Mun, purportedly made the radio-controlled explosive with unemployed Kwan Ka-yiu, 27, and electrical technician Freeman Ho Kin-chung, 40, on the hillside of Siu Lang Shui Road on Saturday. All three men were denied bail on Monday. At the time of their arrest, police said the suspects were testing explosives that were were intended for use at mass protests, but it was unclear which chemicals or explosives were involved as the bombs had been detonated. Prosecutors on Monday said the bomb might have been set off from up to 50 metres away by heating up a metal coil that was immersed in an unknown chemical. They said the police thought the device had considerable power because the men had shields, helmets and bulletproof vests for protection. Hong Kong police foil second bomb plot in under a week and arrest three men 14 Dec 2019 Hong Kong police foil second bomb plot in under a week and arrest three men 14 Dec 2019 According to the prosecution, the bomb was part of the suspects’ conspiracy to unlawfully and maliciously wound Hong Kong police officers with intent to do them grievous bodily harm. The three Tuen Mun residents were charged with one count each of making an explosive substance and conspiracy to wound with intent. They were not required to enter a plea in their first court appearance because the police needed more time to examine the seized device and the defendants’ mobile phones.  The men will be remanded in custody until their next hearing on March 30, when they could face additional charges after the police investigation. Making explosives carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in jail, while conspiracy to wound with intent is punishable by life imprisonment under the Offences Against the Person Ordinance.  	SCMP

The increase, which was made public on Monday, was requested despite a 6.8 per cent rise in Star Ferry’s farebox revenue in 2018 – to HK$53.07 million (US$6.8 million) from HK$49.7 million in 2017. The ferry also reported a modest increase in daily passengers on its two ferry routes – from Tsim Sha Tsui to Central and Tsim Sha Tsui to Wan Chai – from about 52,800 passenger trips in 2017 to 53,900 in 2018.

But in a paper scheduled for discussion during Friday’s meeting of the Legislative Council’s transport panel, the Transport Department said: “In the fallout of the recent social events, Star Ferry, which is a transport mode much preferred by visitors normally, saw a year-on-year drop of nearly 20 per cent in its total patronage between July and October this year.” The department continued: “In particular, the average daily patronage in August this year [around 38,500 passenger trips] dropped by over 30 per cent compared with that in August last year [around 56,800 passenger trips]. It is expected that the patronage would hardly return to the previous level in the short term.” It is expected that the patronage would hardly return to the previous level in the short term Transport Department The Star Ferry is applying to raise weekday fares on its two routes to HK$3.20 from HK$2.70 for adults. On Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays, the proposed rise is to HK$4.20 from HK$3.70 for adults. raise weekday fares  For Tsim Sha Tsui–Central route, proposed lower deck fares are HK$2.60 for adults during weekdays, and HK$3.60 for weekends and public holidays. According to the department, the total operating cost of the Star Ferry rose about nine per cent from HK$90.85 million in 2016 to HK$99.07 million in 2018. But total revenue went up by only 6.4 per cent over the same period, from HK$90.51 million to HK$96.35 million.  Established in 1898, Star Ferry has been served as dependable public transport and a famous symbol of Hong Kong. National Geographic listed Star Ferry as one of the “Hong Kong must-dos” and rated the Star Ferry crossing as one of the 50 “places of a lifetime”. A transport panel member, Wilson Or Chong-shing, of the Democratic Alliance for Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, said he appreciated the difficulties faced by the Star Ferry but was concerned about the price increase. the price increase  “Although it may not make Star Ferry unaffordable for most commuters or tourists with a 50 cents increase in fare, in the wake of the looming recession, it is not the right time for the government to approve the fare rise,” Or said.   Richard Tsoi Yiu-cheong, spokesman for the concern group Coalition to Monitor Public Transport and Utilities, shared similar views. “The crux of the matter is that the government lacks a ferry service policy,” he said. “We have a beautiful harbour and a long coastline. The government should encourage ferry companies to expand their services, like more harbour cruises [and] more island-hopping cruises.” To alleviate the pressure for fare increases, the government allows the Star Ferry to sublet commercial and retail space at its piers to generate non-farebox revenue. The rental income accounted for 35.4 per cent of the company’s total revenue in 2017 and 29.9 per cent of its revenue in 2018. pressure for fare increases 	SCMP

The broadcaster slipped into the red for the first time in a decade last year, recording a net loss of HK$199 million (US$25.5 million) compared with a profit of HK$243.6 million in 2017, due to a write-off on bond holdings issued by Chinese theatre operator SMI Holdings Group. A source familiar with the situation said TVB chairman Charles Chan Kwok-keung was expected to step down in early January next year after the US$106 million loss arising from the investments was revealed in May. Last year, TVB was forced to write off HK$500 million from its exposure to the default of the secured and unsecured bonds it bought earlier in the year. Hong Kong’s largest television broadcaster TVB defends neutrality of news coverage 16 Jul 2019 Hong Kong’s largest television broadcaster TVB defends neutrality of news coverage 16 Jul 2019 About four months after the broadcaster’s purchase, SMI’s financial troubles surfaced with HK$300 million outstanding in salaries and cinema rents and 150 million yuan (US$21.7 million) for unpaid licensing fees.  SMI is a Hong Kong-based producer and distributor of movies and television dramas and one of the two major shareholders of cinema operator Chengdu Runyun Culture Broadcasting. Francis Lun Sheung-nim, CEO of brokerage GEO Securities, said Chan should already have stepped down for the investment blunder. “It is long overdue,” he said.  A TVB spokeswoman said any change in directors would be announced in accordance with listing rules. The social unrest shows no signs of abating. It is impossible to predict when social order will be restored and the economy will recover Mark Lee, TVB group CEO Lun said the prospects for electronic media remained difficult, partly because of competition from the internet.  TVB’s Lee said the company’s lay-offs were the result of a re-engineering of certain parts of the business process to improve efficiency, amid uncertainty brought about by anti-government protests and the recession. recession Figures released earlier showed the economy in the third quarter shrank 3.2 per cent from the previous quarter, which had seen a drop of 0.5 per cent. Lee said advertising, television broadcasting, newspapers and other media did not escape unscathed from the protests, which have dragged on for more than six months and dealt a heavy blow to tourism, food and catering, and retail industries. “The uncertain outlook of Hong Kong is the most worrying,” Lee said in the memo. “The social unrest shows no signs of abating. It is impossible to predict when social order will be restored and the economy will recover. In the face of this severe situation, all enterprises must take appropriate measures to ensure the business sustainability and retain core capabilities.” He promised to inform staff who would lose their jobs by the end of the year at the latest. He also said the company would compensate the employees with payment in lieu of notice and a special gratuity payment according to labour laws.  The affected employees would be granted a discretionary bonus equivalent to half a month’s salary, while those promoted would get a performance-linked pay rise, he said.

The demonstrations remained peaceful with a minimal police presence, as participants were not seen blocking roads. In Central, hundreds of protesters, mainly office workers, gathered in the atrium of the IFC Mall at 1pm, responding to online calls for a flash mob against alleged police brutality. “Disband the police force now,” they chanted, a day after protesters marched through various shopping malls and police fired tear gas in late-night street clashes in Mong Kok, where protesters threw projectiles and started fires on the roads. I guess many Hongkongers do not feel the warmth this winter. But I believe as long as those who have the same beliefs come together, at least we are not lonely Christmas message written by Ally Lai, a second-year Chinese University student Crowds were also seen in Causeway Bay, with black-clad protesters giving out Christmas cards to passers-by, asking them to write messages for the injured or arrested. A supporter of the event said they had collected more than 100 Christmas cards, which would be handed to Spark Alliance HK, a non-profit organisation, which will distribute the cards to arrested protesters.  Over more than half a year of regular violent street clashes between protesters and police, more than 6,100 people, aged 11 to 84, have been arrested, according to the force. The Hospital Authority said more than 2,600 have been admitted to hospital with injuries related to the protests, at which officers have used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon, and demonstrators have regularly hurled bricks, petrol bombs and other projectiles. Ally Lai, a second-year Chinese University student, said she hoped to write to those arrested, including some of her classmates, because “they have sacrificed a lot for our freedom and the next generation’s”.   A 47-year-old Japanese housewife living in the city, who identified herself as Chinatsu, said she felt “saddened” by the huge numbers of arrested people. She said she hoped that, by writing them a Christmas card, she could let them know they still had support and should not give up.  “They are so young, and many have given up their futures,” she said, before offering a story of her gratitude towards a group of protesters.

Secretary for Labour and Welfare Law Chi-kwong outlined for the first time the powers of the proposed panel, which is to look into the political and socio-economic causes of the anti-government unrest that has roiled the city for six months. anti-government unrest “The government has not considered at this initial stage giving it the subpoena powers, but I believe different parties would want to cooperate since the issues involved are important,” he told a radio programme. He added the government would rely on other evidence, such as reports from the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC), the force watchdog. Law’s comments went further than those made by other top city officials. Last week, Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah did not rule out giving investigative or subpoena powers to the body when asked by the press.  Hong Kong has been gripped by civil unrest and street protests since June, which were sparked by fierce opposition to the now-withdrawn extradition bill. now-withdrawn extradition bill Demonstrators have since expanded their demands to include calls for universal suffrage and an independent commission of inquiry, led by a judge, into allegations of police brutality.  But the government has resisted those pleas, offering instead an independent review committee to probe causes of public anger and to come up with solutions.  The committee, however will not make findings or adjudicate on individual complaints against the police force, which the government said was best left to the IPCC, an organisation that protesters accuse of lacking independence and not having sufficient investigative powers. Giving examples of the panel’s remit, Law said: “For instance, the independent review committee will look at how some so-called peaceful, rational and non-violent protesters have turned radical, or how some have gone from giving backup support to appearing on the front line.” Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping’ protests Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping’ protests The welfare minister also said some experts from local think tanks had agreed “on a preliminary basis” to join the committee, but added it remained unlikely the panel would be in place by the end of this year. In Beijing, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said she remained confident that appropriate candidates could be recruited to launch the committee. “Some people may be worried about being bullied on the internet if they work for the government. But, I think we can find the right people as we continue to explain our work to them,” she said. In the wake of the disastrous district election results for the pro-establishment camp last month, Lam said the government was in the process of setting up an independent review committee to look at the underlying causes of the protests.

Law also defended his bureau’s record on tackling poverty during his radio appearance. The government’s annual Hong Kong poverty situation report, released on Friday, showed more than 1.4 million people, or one in five Hongkongers, were living below the poverty line in 2018, representing a 10-year high and a 0.3 per cent year-on-year rise to 20.4 percentage points.   The poverty line is set at 50 per cent of median household income per month before taxation and government policy interventions, including social welfare payments, such as allowances for the elderly and low-income families. Law said the number of people in poverty had dropped to 910,000, a reduction of 40,000 from the year before, after taking into account recurrent and one-off government allowances. But critics have pointed to the fact that post-intervention poverty numbers still rose by 0.2 per cent from 2017 to 14.9 per cent, when only regular welfare payments were counted.

Meeting Lam on the second occasion in two months, this time during her third duty visit to the capital, President Xi Jinping noted that Hong Kong’s situation this year was the most critical and complicated since it returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Xi Jinping Xi Jinping praises Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam over handling of protest crisis Xi Jinping praises Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam over handling of protest crisis “Facing difficulties and pressure, Chief Executive Lam has stood firm on the ‘one country, two systems’ principle, governed in accordance with the law, and remained dedicated. You did plenty of work in difficult situations,” Xi said in his opening remarks to the city’s leader, adding that her government had “rolled out policy initiatives to support businesses, alleviate people’s woes, and seriously solve deep-rooted conflicts and problems in society”. “The central government fully acknowledges your courage and commitment in these unusual times,” he told her. Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping’ protests Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping’ protests Xi also expressed strong support for the city’s beleaguered police force to firmly enforce the law, and urged other sectors to do their part as well. police force  “I hope that different sectors in society can be united, work together to push forward Hong Kong’s development, and get it back on track,” he said. ‘Hong Kong remains free’: city launches new PR blitz overseas ‘Hong Kong remains free’: city launches new PR blitz overseas Xi also reminded her of his remarks at the BRICS summit in Brazil last month, when he made clear Beijing’s “unswerving determination” to protect national sovereignty, security and development interests, to implement the guiding principle of one country, two systems, and to oppose any external force interfering in Hong Kong’s affairs. Lam replied by thanking the president for his “care and guidance” over the past six months, as well as his “trust and support” in her handling of the worst crisis since the handover. During their previous meeting in Shanghai on November 4, Xi lent his full support to Lam, quashing speculation she would be replaced, even as he signalled that her government must quell the ongoing turmoil. ongoing turmoil  While he demanded “unswerving efforts to stop and punish violent activities” in accordance with the law, the president also called for more dialogue with different sectors of society.  Earlier on Monday, Premier Li Keqiang complimented Lam for her efforts in dealing with the unrest which had dealt a “serious blow” to Hong Kong’s economy. “You have been leading the government in doing the utmost to safeguard social stability, and rolled out a series of measures to help businesses and stabilise employment. It can be said that you rose to the challenges,” he told her. “The central government fully acknowledges the efforts made by you and the city’s government.” We can say that the city is facing unprecedented, serious and complicated situations Premier Li Keqiang But the premier also reminded Lam that she still had her work cut out for her. “Hong Kong has yet to come out from the difficulties. The city’s government must continue to make efforts in stopping violence and ending chaos in accordance with the law, and restore order,” Li said. “It must also study with urgency the deep-rooted conflicts and problems in Hong Kong’s socio-economic development, and safeguard the city’s long-term prosperity and stability.” Li also lamented the harm the protest movement had inflicted on society as a whole. “Obvious recession has emerged in Hong Kong’s economy, and many sectors were dealt a serious blow. We can say that the city is facing unprecedented, serious and complicated situations,” he said. Asked later in a media briefing if the two state leaders’ reminders about putting a stop to the chaos and violence reflected her lack of progress in that regard, Lam insisted they had endorsed her administration’s efforts to tackle the crisis. “It’s difficult to compare each word the state leaders used in my duty visit. But I feel encouraged that the president understands the pressure I faced,” she replied when asked if she felt their support was diminishing. As for Premier Li’s concerns about the impact of the protests, Lam admitted Hong Kong had faced a grim situation on the political, economic and social fronts over the past year. The city recorded a significant economic downturn over the first six months, she said, but attributed it primarily to external factors, such as the ongoing US-China trade war. US-China trade war “There will be a more significant downturn in the third quarter because of the internal social unrest,” Lam added. Political commentator Johnny Lau Yui-siu said the two state leaders’ remarks showed the central government was not fully satisfied with Lam’s performance in stopping the violence, but still chose to continue to support her. “Xi Jinping’s appreciation of Lam sticking to the bottom line of the ‘one country, two systems’ indicates that Beijing puts the chief executive’s political loyalty as a top priority,” Lau said. “Beijing has not changed its tough stance on Hong Kong, despite the pro-establishment camp’s humiliating defeat in last month’s district council elections.” humiliating defeat Restart universal suffrage talks to defuse Hong Kong protests, trade boss says 16 Dec 2019 Restart universal suffrage talks to defuse Hong Kong protests, trade boss says 16 Dec 2019 Lau said Beijing was still holding onto its long-standing view that the deep-rooted problems in Hong Kong stemmed from failure to boost the city’s economic development and address the wealth gap. “Beijing still skirts Hong Kong people’s calls for political reform as reflected in the anti-government protests since June,” he said. Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of the semi-official think tank Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said the top leaders’ latest remarks signalled the unlikelihood of the government meeting protesters’ remaining demands for an independent investigation into the police’s handling of the protests, amnesty for those arrested and the implementation of universal suffrage.   “Beijing holds the view that Hong Kong’s ongoing crisis is the result of foreign interference, so they reiterated their support for Lam and the police, believing that a hardline approach is best to end the street protests,” he said. Li Xiaobing, an associate professor at Nankai University’s law school, said Xi’s recognition of Lam’s performance had quashed speculation of a city leadership reshuffle. “Replacing the leader is not the best option in Hong Kong as these problems still have to be fixed following the reshuffle,” he said. But opposition lawmaker and Civic Party leader Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu said Beijing’s stance would not help end the stalemate. “It feels like the central government is not entirely connected to what’s happening on the ground,” he said, also warning that the strong endorsement of the city’s police force could empower it to crack down harder on the protests.

Peter Levesque, who runs one of the city’s largest container terminal operators, bemoaned the “missed opportunity” for democratic reforms five years ago, as he warned of a widening wealth gap between generations that made it too expensive for many Hongkongers to start a family.

But the former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said the situation was “fixable” by focusing on fresh dialogue for universal suffrage and helping people to buy their own homes. universal suffrage “I have seen over the last 20-plus years since the handover, that ‘one country, two systems’ has been very successful,” Levesque told the Post, referring to the principle under which the city is ruled from Beijing but promised a high degree of autonomy.

Hong Kong has been pummelled by the ongoing political crisis and the US-China trade war, leading the city to slip into recession in the third quarter of this year.

He identified resolving housing affordability and restarting talks on universal suffrage as two priorities for defusing the crisis. “If it takes 80 months of basic salary to put a down payment on a 250 square foot flat, that’s a problem. If you can’t afford to start a family and to live on your own, that’s another problem,” he said. “And on universal suffrage, there was such a missed opportunity around suffrage back in 2014.

The 38-year-old, who lives across the border in Guangzhou, used to visit the city every month but said the unrest had alerted her to the fact that “some people in Hong Kong may not like mainland people. We were not aware of that before”. She continued: “As parents, we have to be worried if we send our children to Hong Kong.” For almost two decades, many mainland Chinese, especially those who live just north of the border, have regarded Hong Kong as their second home, visiting regularly for shopping and entertainment, for business reasons, to visit relatives or for medical check-ups.   But the mass protests – triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill – and increasing violence have prompted some to have second thoughts about their southern neighbour. Xie, a housewife married to a businessman, used to visit Hong Kong almost every month with her family – for everything from an annual medical check-up to a day out at the city’s theme parks.  But the six months of unrest made her so worried about her daughter’s safety that she even refused to take the girl there for a ballet exam. Now she has abandoned a plan to send her eldest daughter to an international school in Cheung Sha Wan, and will instead look to the United States.  “Our daily lives used to be closely tied,” Xie said of the cross-border link. “Now it has become quite uncomfortable.” Hong Kong protests: restaurants spray-painted and diners harassed in ‘Christmas shopping’ action 16 Dec 2019 Hong Kong protests: restaurants spray-painted and diners harassed in ‘Christmas shopping’ action 16 Dec 2019 Jade Shi, a video producer who also lives in Guangzhou, said she had decided to stop visiting the city because of the reaction of her friends to the protests.  Previously she had made regular cross-border trips – stocking up on everything from soy sauce and shampoo to clothes. “I shopped at Sogo [a well-known store in Causeway Bay] every year when it put on its annual sales promotion,” Shi said. “I didn’t just come for the discounts but also because I liked the feeling of being a consumer in a cosmopolitan city.” But now her friends have persuaded her to change her shopping habits. “Some of my friends were shocked by the protests in Hong Kong,” Shi said. “They saw videos of the violence [in the protests]. I understand that the news may have been manipulated but you cannot argue with the people around you.” For other mainlanders there is a real financial cost to the protests. Ken Lee, who runs a “daigou” business, a type of shopping agency, said business was down by 20 per cent because he faced problems in getting items such as cosmetics from Hong Kong. “The parallel importers were too afraid to go to Hong Kong and I couldn’t get new supplies,” Lee said. “Luckily the situation has improved after the district council elections [which saw the pro-establishment camp suffer heavy losses].” But Lee had already started looking further afield for suppliers, saying: “I now source half of my goods from South Korea and Japan and don’t depend on Hong Kong as much.”   For others, the losses will be harder to recover. Robin Wu, a 34-year-old insurance broker from Hong Kong, said she had lost about HK$100,000 (US$12,800) in commission income over the past few months because some of her clients in Guangdong would not come to Hong Kong to close the deal. During one of her recent business trips to Dongguan, a boom town midway between Guangzhou and Hong Kong, she was told bluntly by business contacts that they would delay their investment decisions until next year, saying “who dares to go to Hong Kong now?”. “I feel worried that I may lose my job [if this continues],” she said. Empty flats near Hong Kong universities a sign protests are keeping mainland students away 14 Dec 2019 Empty flats near Hong Kong universities a sign protests are keeping mainland students away 14 Dec 2019 But the three mainlanders all said they hoped that Hong Kong would return to normal soon. When she last visited Hong Kong in August, Xie was struck by the orderliness of the protesters and noted how clean things remained after a demonstration. However, in the evening the city’s streets and restaurants were deserted. “This was not the Hong Kong that I have known and I hope calm will return one day,” she said. “I can understand what the young people want, although what they are calling for may be more complicated than what I can imagine.” 	SCMP

The Hongkonger works as a property consultancy executive in Shanghai, and for him, the pan-democrats’ landslide victory was disappointing. district council election results “I feel terribly sad about the results, and some of my [Hong Kong] friends here feel the same, because the winning candidates didn’t denounce the protesters’ violence,” said the 47-year-old, who has worked in mainland China for more than a decade. He said he could not openly discuss how he felt about the November 24 elections because he feared a backlash, and that Hong Kong – where he was born and raised – was not the place it once was. “Hong Kong used to be a pretty safe city and inclusive of different opinions. But now if you say you support the police or the Communist Party, you could get beaten up in the street,” the real-estate professional said. Stay or go: Hongkongers consider emigration options amid protests Stay or go: Hongkongers consider emigration options amid protests For the past six months, the city has been gripped by protests sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill. These have since broadened into an anti-government movement calling for greater democracy, which has seen increasingly violent clashes with police. gripped by protests Seen as a de facto referendum on the protests, the polls saw the pro-democracy camp win control of 17 out of 18 district councils, all of which previously had a pro-establishment majority. Caught in the middle Hongkongers like Robert who live and work in the mainland are finding themselves saddened by the events back home, and caught in the middle between their friends in the city and those over the border. Bail denied for suspects caught with powerful radio-controlled bomb 16 Dec 2019 Bail denied for suspects caught with powerful radio-controlled bomb 16 Dec 2019 There are no official figures on how many Hongkongers work and live in mainland China since their travel permits allow them to freely move across the border. But the number is estimated at 100,000 in Shanghai alone.  Most of those who spoke to the South China Morning Post asked for their names and companies to be withheld because they feared for their safety and that their Hong Kong offices could be targeted. South China Morning Post Another Hongkonger, who leads an architecture firm in Shanghai, was also concerned about the protesters’ use of violence, saying it would not resolve the situation.   Other Hongkongers based across the border have lost friends over the protests. In Beijing, 27-year-old investment analyst “Alex” said some of his friends in Hong Kong stopped talking to him when they found out he did not agree with them on the protests.  “Some of them argued with me and some even deleted me from their social media contacts. We clashed over topics like the behaviour of [Hong Kong] police officers, and who was right and who was wrong – the officers or the rioters,” he said. “So recently when I got together with Hong Kong friends for dinner, we just avoided these topics altogether.” ‘Hong Kong remains free’: city launches new PR blitz overseas 17 Dec 2019 ‘Hong Kong remains free’: city launches new PR blitz overseas 17 Dec 2019 Alex’s relationships with his mainland friends are better. He said many had studied overseas and used virtual private networks to access international media reports on the Hong Kong protests, many of which are blocked in the mainland. Those who read only local news, which is tightly controlled, wanted to know how Hong Kong had turned so chaotic and violent. “I explained the whole situation to them, and our friendship has not been affected by this issue,” he said. Terence Lin, the 30-year-old founder of an internet company based in Shenzhen and Xiamen in Fujian province, is also trying to keep his mainland friends informed about what is happening in Hong Kong. “I tell them the situation is not as tumultuous as the reports suggest, that the protesters announce where they will go before each protest,” he said. Lin noted that mainland media reports were aimed at deterring readers from sympathising with the protesters. He said the protests were a result of “political and economic structural problems”. Mainland China beckons Over the border, work opportunities and the economy are big draws for Hongkongers. Robert noted that the mainland economy had seen rapid growth over the past decade while Hong Kong was sluggish. Hong Kong’s gross domestic product grew about 2 to 3 per cent annually over the past five years, compared with the mainland growth rate of 6.6 to 7.8 per cent in the same period. But he said although the economy and innovation was thriving on the mainland, Hong Kong still had the advantage of freedom of speech. “At least we can use Facebook in Hong Kong,” he said. Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping’ protests Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping’ protests Alex said he was drawn to the mainland after he graduated in finance from a US university three years ago. Working in financial investment in China, where the market is promising and there are many start-ups, was an obvious choice and he wanted to try somewhere new. “When I started working in Beijing, I was surprised by how hard-working my mainland colleagues were. Compared to them, many young people in Hong Kong tend to complain a lot,” he said. Many young Hongkongers held negative views of mainland China, he said, seeing it as a place where people were poor and not well educated, and many – especially those who supported the protests – had not been over the border. “Mainland tourists have been flooding in to Hong Kong over the past decade, but when they behave in an uncivilised way, like the nouveaux riches, it doesn’t help to improve impressions [of mainland China],” Alex said. Meet the mainland Chinese who are living in fear in Hong Kong 8 Oct 2019 Meet the mainland Chinese who are living in fear in Hong Kong 8 Oct 2019 He also said he believed mainland China was too big for democracy to work. “I do actually understand [Beijing’s] rationale. There are 1.4 billion people in China – if it is as free as Hong Kong it will be doomed,” he said. Property executive Robert agreed that Hong Kong people did not have a good understanding of mainland China. “I think an important factor behind the protests is that many Hongkongers don’t understand China. They didn’t learn much about Chinese history in school,” he said. Overseas students in the US debate on Hong Kong protests Overseas students in the US debate on Hong Kong protests Internet company founder Lin said he hoped Beijing would reflect on the results of the district council polls. “The Hong Kong government is the rich people’s government and I am totally disappointed with it,” he said. “My hopes are pinned on the central government to launch political and economic reforms in Hong Kong. I also hope the central authorities can think about why the majority of Hongkongers voted for pro-democracy candidates in the election.” 	SCMP

In the worst drop in more than a decade, the airport handled 5.02 million passengers, some 969,000 fewer in November, a drop of 16.2 per cent compared to the same period in 2018. The Airport Authority, which runs one of Asia’s premier air transit and cargo hubs, attributed the sharp fall to a drop in arrivals, in contrast, the number of passengers transiting and departing experienced marginal growth. “Passenger volume continued to be affected by weak visitor traffic, with passengers to and from the mainland and Southeast Asia experiencing the most significant decreases,” the authority said in a statement. Between August and November, the airport handled 3.3 million fewer passengers. October saw a drop of 802,000 travellers, September was down 710,000, and August fell 851,000. The drops equates to a reduction of 12-13 per cent. In June 2009, passenger traffic fell 18.9 per cent at the height of the global financial crisis.  The slump caused by the effects of the protest have been far-reaching, with the airport’s passenger numbers growing in the first half of the year – up 1.03 million in the year to July against the same period of 2018. To date, the airport has processed 65.8 million travellers. At the same point up to November 2018, the figure stood at 68.1 million. Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping’ protests Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping’ protests   The authority said it had seen a 6 per cent rise in transit traffic, while outbound Hong Kong resident travel grew 5 per cent in November. It did not specify the drop for inbound passengers. Airlines in Hong Kong extend cuts to passenger capacity into spring 2020 13 Dec 2019 Airlines in Hong Kong extend cuts to passenger capacity into spring 2020 13 Dec 2019 Hong Kong’s largest airline, Cathay Pacific, is targeting connecting passengers who do not want to stop in Hong Kong, as the carrier offsets reductions in inbound and outbound travel.  To do this, Cathay, which relies on almost half its passenger mix on connecting passengers, has wooed transit travellers with even cheaper airfares. November was also the biggest month yet for airlines cutting back in and out of Hong Kong, with close to 10 per cent of scheduled seats removed through cancelled flights and routes, according to data from the International Air Transport Association. Last month, Cathay Pacific said its capacity for November and December would be between 6 and 7 per cent lower in response to weaker passenger demand. Mainland carriers led the sharp pullback, with the likes of Xiamen Airlines eliminating the bulk of its 26 weekly flights, while China Eastern scaled back Shanghai Pudong-Hong Kong flights to 32 from 56 a week. November was equally tough for Hong Kong Airlines as the trading conditions pushed the city’s third largest airline to the brink of collapse, as it slashed more services to stem its losses. As the Airport Authority noted, travel from China was very weak as citizens from the mainland steer clear of the civil unrest in Hong Kong. Cathay Pacific is also a victim of the boycott of mainland tourists and simmering punishment from China’s top civil aviation regulator. Outside the seasonality of the post-Lunar New Year travel period, November typically is one of the quieter months of travel for the year, but the extent of the protests worsened the situation. Also amid the US-China trade tensions, cargo volumes continued to fall, down 3.4 per cent to 450,000 tonnes, in a traditionally peak period for freight. Hong Kong’s airport may see a 7 to 8 per cent drop in passenger volume through fiscal 2020, ending March 31, because of fewer visitors amid social unrest, according to S&P Global Ratings. It also penned in a tepid zero to 2 per cent growth in the following two years linked to the city’s GDP growth. 	SCMP

Chan also gave encouraging words to the victim’s wife during Saturday’s low-key visit to the hospital where the victim is recovering, which was revealed in a message posted by pro-Beijing legislator Elizabeth Quat on her Facebook page on Sunday. Quat, who has been helping the man, who cannot be named because of a court order, said she accompanied Chan during his visit. The 57-year-old construction worker was involved in an argument with masked protesters who rampaged through Ma On Shan MTR station on November 11.

The man was very pleased when he saw the financial secretary.” A picture posted on Quat’s Facebook page showed the man sitting up, with both of his hands wrapped up in gauze. On his face were patches of new skin and burn marks. The picture did not show Chan however.  Quat said the man wanted to thank the public for their care and support.

Hong Kong has been rocked by months of social unrest, sparked by a controversial extradition bill. The bill has been withdrawn, but the protests have morphed into an increasingly violent anti-government movement. Meanwhile, in a piece posted on his official blog on Sunday, Chan called on protesters to stop the violence and vandalism. “No matter what our differences may be, we are always able to find a way out by holding talks, negotiating, and discussion,” he said.

A small number of hard-core protesters smashed the glass panels of the atrium in New Town Plaza, Sha Tin – one of the day’s main trouble spots – where they also vandalised restaurants under the Maxim’s chain and spray-painted slogans on the floor. In Mong Kok, late on Sunday night, police fired several rounds of tear gas – the first such incident in two weeks – after a small crowd had gathered on the streets. Earlier in the day, riot police stormed into New Town Plaza mall – and Telford Plaza in Kowloon Bay – to chase after and subdue protesters, triggering clashes between officers and those in black. Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping’ protests Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping’ protests Families and onlookers were caught up in the maelstrom with one young boy appearing to be hit by pepper spray intended to drive protesters away. A first-aider tended to the child in Kowloon Bay who was heard saying his eye hurt. A woman in Sha Tin who argued with protesters was spray-painted in the face and was helped away by paramedics. While the so-called Christmas shopping protests took place in at least seven malls across the city in the afternoon, elsewhere thousands gathered in Tamar Park in Admiralty to voice support for the city’s beleaguered police force and condemn violence by radical activists. The unprecedented social unrest, triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill which then morphed into a wider movement for police accountability and democracy, has been roiling Hong Kong for more than six months. social unrest extradition bill Protests see travellers avoiding Hong Kong in record numbers 16 Dec 2019 Protests see travellers avoiding Hong Kong in record numbers 16 Dec 2019 In New Town Plaza, demonstrators took over the atrium from 2pm while others marched around the mall, singing protest songs and shouting anti-government and anti-police slogans.  They vandalised a restaurant under the Maxim’s chain – a popular target of protesters’ ire on account of critical remarks made by the founder’s daughter Annie Wu Suk-ching – shouted at diners and sprayed graffiti on the storefront. In another incident, a small crowd surrounded a woman, pushed her around and threatened her for about 15 minutes. They accused her of taking pictures of protesters’ faces, then grabbed her phone and smashed it.  The woman, who gave her surname as Ng, said she had not taken any photos of people’s faces.  “What power do you have to search my identity card or phone?” she said afterwards. “We are all Hongkongers, a family. Why do we need to give in to political conflict and deprive others’ freedom? I feel some people have lost all reason.” A 16-year-old secondary school pupil, who only gave her name as Olivia, said she hoped Sunday’s protests would force businesses to cut ties with the government or police. “Since the movement reached this stage, neutrality is essentially equal to supporting the government or police,” she said, adding the force must be held accountable for its handling of demonstrations. Clashes soon broke out as police entered to stop protesters blocking mall entrances and staircases.   Officers used batons and pepper spray on protesters, who threw projectiles and water in return. A few arrests were made. Officers also pointed crowd-control guns at those gathered inside the mall. As police retreated, a smoke bomb was thrown into the bus terminus outside Sha Tin railway station. The force condemned the “extremely irresponsible” act that “could have caused chaos and panic”. Similar scenes played out at Telford Plaza and Metroplaza in Kwai Fong, where protesters hurled verbal abuse or chanted slogans at diners, while disrupting the operation of restaurants. There were also protests in Times Square in Causeway Bay, PopCorn in Tseung Kwan O, Cityplaza in Tai Koo Shing and Harbour City in Tsim Sha Tsui. Over in Tamar Park, those rallying to offer their backing to police waved national flags. “What’s the problem with police doing their job, which is to protect Hong Kong?” tourism industry worker Joe Yeung, 51, said. “If there was no violence from the rioters, there would be no tear gas.” Leo Leung Hoi-fung, organiser of the pro-police rally, called on people to support “blue” shops – the colour symbolising the pro-establishment side – such as Maxim’s. Police estimated 11,200 attended the event at its peak. Meanwhile, at a separate rally at Edinburgh Place in Central, hundreds of social workers vowed to stage a three-day strike from Tuesday. One social worker in his mid-20s, who gave his surname as Yeung, said the strike was a change in tactics after months of increasingly violent protests, which had resulted in more than 6,000 arrests. “Organising a strike is more powerful than violent action,” Yeung said. According to Patrick Lam, a member of the All-In Strike Committee of the social welfare sector, at least 2,000 social workers so far had said they would take part. “We are not sure how many units or services will be closed, but we are expecting a vast effect,” he said. Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po, writing on his blog on Sunday, again expressed concerns that the months of unrest would drive away foreign investors and warned that Hong Kong would lose its competitiveness in holding international conferences, exhibitions and major events. It also emerged that Chan had on Saturday visited a man who was set ablaze by radical protesters last month and who had undergone three rounds of skin grafts and was recovering. man who was set ablaze Chan also spoke to the man’s wife during the visit, which was revealed in a Facebook post by pro-Beijing legislator Elizabeth Quat on Sunday. “[Chan] had asked me about the man’s condition several times before,” Quat wrote. “[He] brought a handwritten card and the man was very pleased when he saw the financial secretary.” Later on Sunday night, scores of people gathered outside the upmarket Pacific Place mall in Admiralty to remember Marco Leung Ling-kit, who fell to his death hanging a banner from an external wall. Some laid flowers on the pavement, while others lit candles and sang songs. People also chanted popular protest slogans such as “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times!” In Mong Kok, near the Langham Place shopping centre, a confrontation broke out at about 9pm between dozens of residents and police, who used pepper spray to disperse the crowd. They also raised a blue flag warning that those there were taking part in an illegal assembly. Police had stopped and searched a man on the street, sparking verbal abuse from people around. A heavy police presence remained on Portland Street outside Langham Place two hours after the initial incident. At another flashpoint in Mong Kok, outside the Hang Seng Bank offices on Nathan Road, officers fired pepper balls to disperse a crowd. A reporter was hit and attended to by volunteer medics. Several rounds of tear gas were fired on Sai Yeung Choi Street South after police raised a black warning flag. At about 11.45pm, police fired tear gas again, on Nathan Road near Soy Street, as they headed towards their vehicles. But there was no sign of protesters or any clashes.

Soon, her boss began questioning her, asking about her political stance. Then she found herself accused of being irresponsible, and she was asked to resign. “My boss was from the mainland. He did not understand the protests and was worried that my involvement would cause him trouble,” Chan said. It took a few months before the design graduate found work doing design and administration in a home office, for HK$50 per hour, a big pay cut. But she is grateful she found a job in the midst of an economic downturn, and happy her new employer shares her outlook on the anti-government protests, now in their seventh month. She got her job through “Find a good boss”, a channel of the Telegram instant messaging application, that helps people out of work because of the protests get back on their feet by matching them with available jobs.  It is one of several channels that have sprung up in recent months, offering protesters everything from counselling to accommodation, transport and health-related services. The jobs channel was set up by a 28-year-old social worker who preferred to be identified only as Pop, who said he came up with the idea after a friend who was arrested for rioting got laid off from work in July. Almost 6,000 protesters have been arrested so far.  “The whole prosecution process takes a few years. Many arrested protesters are constrained by bail conditions and they have to report to the police station at least once a week,” Pop said.  “That makes it hard for them to find jobs, not to mention that there are employers reluctant to hire them because of their political stance and alleged offences.” It is a leaderless movement in general. But without active coordination, the movement could not be so resilient City University associate professor Edmund Cheng Wai Pop launched the jobs channel at the end of July and found there were far more people needing help than he thought. Since August, the channel has attracted 2,000 jobseekers for around 1,700 job vacancies, and 680 applicants have been matched with employers so far. The response was so overwhelming that Pop quit his job in September to run the channel full-time, with the help of four volunteers. “There are now about 50 new applicants every day, with 50 fresh vacancies openings,” Pop said. The jobs include part-time cleaning jobs to positions in sales, restaurants, as designers, office workers and as assistants to newly elected district councillors. Employers leave their contact information via the channel, whose administrators then connect interested applicants after checking their basic personal information. The jobs channel is one of more than 100 Telegram channels centred on the protests. With his social work background, Pop has helped in another channel, working with 20 professional counsellors to offer consultation services round-the-clock to those in need. Edmund Cheng Wai, an associate professor in the public policy department of the City University of Hong Kong, said the coordination of groups in Telegram or Facebook had evolved with the development of the protest movement. “It is a leaderless movement in general. But without active coordination, the movement could not be so resilient,” he said. He pointed out that the coordinators behind these channels do not behave like leaders of large organisations, but appear to be more “self-mobilised” individuals making use of their own networks to get things done. “Everyone, according to his professional expertise or occupation, can find his own role and offer support to the movement,” he said, noting that those in the movement have evolved from organising protest marches to making beautiful promotional leaflets, and providing practical support such as with jobs.

At least one help channel for protesters has spawned another. Fung, a final-year university student of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and an active protester, wanted to move out of his home because he needed a break from his parents, whom he described as “deep blue”. Through a Telegram channel finding temporary accommodation for protesters, he found a place to stay. His host told him he knew of many frontline protesters who suffered from coughing after being exposed to tear gas, but were reluctant to seek medical help. Fung checked and found that there were indeed many with symptoms such as runny nose and headaches as well. “I wondered if we could come up with some herbal formula to help them,” he said. With an initial capital of HK$5,000 raised from his friends, he contacted a registered TCM practitioner who concocted a herbal powder to soothe sore throats. Then Fung launched a Telegram channel announcing the product, and recruited first aiders at the protests to distribute the herbal medication to anyone needing it, free of charge. Soon, more TCM practitioner offered help, and donations began flowing in too. Fung’s group now offers more products – a herbal powder for cough, another for diarrhoea, and a cream for burning skin, an after-effect of pepper spray. The products are distributed free of charge at various spots, including protests and “yellow” shops which support the movement. The channel is now backed by more than 60 TCM practitioners who give advice to those who seek help via Telegram or visit their clinics. Hongkonger ‘shot in eye by police while in protest area’ threatens legal action 16 Dec 2019 Hongkonger ‘shot in eye by police while in protest area’ threatens legal action 16 Dec 2019 Fung said more than 6,000 cases have been handled so far, comprising those who sought advice online only, and those who went to the clinics. Patients pay what they can afford to the platform for the medical service, and the practitioners submit claims. Fung has made the channel’s finances public, showing it received more than HK$750,000 in payments from patients and donations from supporters, and paid the practitioners HK$230,000. The channel received HK$300,000 from the 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund, which raised more than HK$7 million through crowdfunding to help protesters pay for medical expenses and legal fees. The financial support enabled Fung to rent premises in Lai Chi Kok to use as a clinic and for storage, and he hires protesters at HK$100 an hour when he needs to pack the herbal powders. “This is better than giving money directly to protesters in need. They want dignity as well,” he said. 	SCMP

Joshua Wong In an only-at-the-UN moment, the words “Berlin process” were unexpectedly chopped from the text of a Security Council statement on Libya early this month at China’s insistence, diplomats said. Libya While the document flagged contributions from the African Union, the League of Arab States and the European Union to help end the conflict, there was no mention of Germany, a key mediator.

Xinjiang  “We must stand up for our values and for human rights,” UK Deputy Permanent Representative Jonathan Allen tweeted on October 29, the day of the diplomatic clash. “Important that this statement was made.” Germany has taken on a leading role in Libya recently, partly because it’s seen as a relatively neutral player. Berlin has sought to bring major powers on the Security Council together for discussions with Egypt, Italy, Turkey and the UAE. In a briefing to the council last month, UN envoy Ghassan Salame sounded an optimistic note on the so-called Berlin process and said a summit in the German capital expected early next year could serve to jump-start negotiations between the warring sides.

The suspects were testing the strength of remote-controlled devices, which were intended for use at mass protests, police said, but it was unclear which chemicals or explosives were involved as the bombs had been detonated. Acting on intelligence, officers from the organised crime and triad bureau ambushed the trio in scrubland off Siu Lang Shui Road in Tuen Mun in the early hours as they carried out tests. The operation came as police said three men and two women, aged 15 to 18, had been arrested in suspected connection with the death of a 70-year-old man who was hit by a brick during a fight between masked protesters and Sheung Shui residents last month. had been arrested death of a 70-year-old man According to a source, police were seeking legal advice on whether the “joint enterprise” principle, which allows for accomplices of the person who strikes the fatal blow in a murder to be convicted of the same crime, could apply. CCTV and online clips did not show the five throwing bricks directly at the man, but some did throw bricks and wound others, the source said. In the Tuen Mun operation, officers also seized a radio-controlled detonation device and protective gear, including shields, bulletproof vests, a steel plate and gas masks at the scene. The tools were believed to have been used during the tests.

The suspects were also testing chemicals and officers would collect soil samples, he added. “This worries us a lot … because many hikers also passed by today. It posed a great risk to the public,” Li said.   Earlier in the week, police defused two powerful home-made bombs in Wan Chai. Suryanto said the detonation method in both instances was the same, but the electrical parts inside the devices were a bit different. defused two powerful home-made bombs  “As the suspects [arrested on Saturday] were just testing the chemicals, we found a small area, 4 inches by 5 inches, that was burnt,” Suryanto said. He said a tiny amount of chemicals and explosives were discovered on the trio, and that the devices were not easily found in the market. “We believe they were testing whether the explosives were functional.” The trio were arrested for causing an explosion likely to endanger life or property and detained for investigation. Li said they had an active role in the plot, including building the bombs. But he refused to disclose if the suspects had previously taken part in anti-government protests, or if they had professional knowledge about bomb making. anti-government protests “They had prepared protective gear during the testing, meaning they didn’t even know the power of the bombs,” Li said. A senior police source said one of those arrested was a 27-year-old laboratory technician from SKH St Simon’s Lui Ming Choi Secondary School in Tuen Mun while another man, 40, worked as an electrician. The third was unemployed.

Officers in the evening escorted one suspect to the school as part of their investigations. Separately, police said on Saturday they found 34 petrol bombs, 20 smoke bombs, 12 corrosive bombs and a number of easily flammable items after receiving a call from City University staff about suspected dangerous items on the Kowloon campus. suspected dangerous items The university also discovered dangerous chemicals on campus last Friday, which were disposed of by police’s explosive ordnance disposal bureau. On Monday, police seized two powerful home-made bombs, packed with 5kg (11lb) each of high-grade explosives along with shrapnel in the form of nails, at Wah Yan College Hong Kong in Wan Chai. Detectives believed they were intended for an attack the previous day on police at a massive anti-government march, which around 800,000 protesters attended. intended for an attack Rents down near Hong Kong universities as mainland students stay away 14 Dec 2019 Rents down near Hong Kong universities as mainland students stay away 14 Dec 2019 It was understood the remote-controlled devices – which officers said had a potential blast radius of up to 100 metres – would not have gone off where they were found, because two mobile phones connected to them, for use as detonators, were turned off. The apparent bomb plot, which emerged after six months of social unrest and political turmoil, prompted the city’s biggest police association to warn that the security situation in Hong Kong was at its “most alarming” in decades, even worse than during a wave of armed robberies in the 1990s. Meanwhile, dozens of people joined a rally on Saturday night calling on Britain’s newly elected parliament to consider terminating the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, the agreement that paved the way for the city’s handover in 1997, because Beijing “had violated declaration promises including ‘one country, two systems’”, but the crowd was smaller than at a similar rally held on Wednesday. Activists said the rally, held outside the British consulate and organised by the Hong Kong Independence Party, was held because at least two Conservative Party MPs who supported their cause were successfully elected in Thursday’s general election.

Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor was also scheduled to meet Vice-Premier Han Zheng, the state leader overseeing Hong Kong and Macau affairs, over dinner on Saturday. Zhang Xiaoming, head of the State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, was expected to attend the dinner. But, unlike in previous years, no separate meeting had been arranged for Lam to meet Zhang personally. After meeting Lam on Monday, Xi will visit Macau on Wednesday to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the casino hub’s return from Portuguese rule and officiate at the inauguration of the city’s new leader and cabinet on Friday. All eyes on President Xi as Carrie Lam heads to Beijing for duty visit 11 Dec 2019 All eyes on President Xi as Carrie Lam heads to Beijing for duty visit 11 Dec 2019 When Lam met Han last month, the vice-premier described the violent protests in Hong Kong as “extreme and destructive acts” that would not be tolerated in any country in the world. He said ending the turmoil was the responsibility of the entire administration – the executive, legislature and judiciary. Commentators previously told the Post that Xi could use Lam’s visit to brief her on issues ranging from protecting national security to rebuilding ties with the pro-establishment camp. Post  Lam did not answer media questions as she arrived at Hong Kong airport on Saturday morning. When she arrived at her hotel in Beijing that afternoon, she was asked whether her meetings with state leaders would touch on national security legislation. She ignored those questions too. Some pundits had warned that, with pro-Beijing ­politicians’ unprecedented losses in district council polls last month, state leaders could discuss with the chief executive plans to replace her or some of her ministers. Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Lam’s deputy, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, was asked on Saturday if a cabinet reshuffle would be on the agenda for Lam’s meeting with Xi. But he said he would leave it to the chief executive to comment on Monday.  “We will continue to do our utmost to tackle difficulties. We are determined in handling the challenges, and we believe that we can overcome them,” Cheung said.  The unrest in Hong Kong, now in its seventh month, was sparked in June by anger at a government bill which would have allowed transfers of fugitives to jurisdictions with which the city lacks a formal extradition agreement. By the time officials withdrew the legislation, the demonstrations had grown into a wider anti-government movement. Protesters and police have regularly clashed on city streets, the former hurling bricks and petrol bombs, and the latter using tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon. Separately, Lam wrote on her Facebook page on Saturday that, starting from this month, her ministers would use live streams on the site to explain policies and engage residents. “The secretary for commerce and economic development and the secretary for labour and welfare will be the first ones to do so in the coming two weeks, and others will follow suit,” she wrote.

Flats which usually get snapped up in December because they are close to campuses and popular with mainlanders are still vacant, and landlords have begun dropping rents. Some mainland students already in Hong Kong are also desperately seeking new flatmates, after others went home in a hurry to escape anti-government protests now in their seventh month. Checks by the Post show almost 200 private flats near the worst-hit campuses have no takers. Post Apart from students who are staying away, the University of Science and Technology told the Post it had suspended all undergraduate exchange programmes for non-local students for the next term “in light of uncertainties in the situation in Hong Kong”. Post Agents said rents have come down by at least 10 per cent for properties near Polytechnic University (PolyU), Chinese University (CUHK), and the University in Hong Kong (HKU), which were hardest hit by clashes between protesters and police last month. Polytechnic University (PolyU), Chinese University (CUHK), and the University in Hong Kong (HKU), which were  Given that foreign students usually share accommodation with two or three to a flat, having 200 vacant flats in Hung Hom, Sha Tin and Western District may indicate that considerably more are not heading to those three universities. The agents said it is unusual that they have not received enquiries from mainlanders for the new semester starting in January.  Mainlanders make up the bulk of non-local students in Hong Kong universities. In the 2018-19 academic year, there were 12,322 mainlanders enrolled as undergraduates at the eight main universities under the Hong Kong University Grants Committee. As Hong Kong protests reflect anti-mainland China sentiment, Carrie Lam boosts cross-border ties 6 Sep 2019 As Hong Kong protests reflect anti-mainland China sentiment, Carrie Lam boosts cross-border ties 6 Sep 2019 The last time mainlanders stayed away was the year after the 2014 Occupy protests, when pro-democracy protesters shut down parts of the city for 79 days. Mainland applications to universities in the city fell by 20 to 40 per cent.  The Post asked the eight publicly funded universities for details of mainland and foreign students who have decided to quit their studies because of the protests, and if new applications have dropped. All said the number who have withdrawn or suspended their studies remained “more or less the same”, with none providing concrete details. Post Some mainland students in Hong Kong say that this year, other mainlanders have been put off by the tear gas, violence and growing anti-mainland sentiment since the protests erupted in June. Some are refusing to return and continue their studies, while newcomers are hesitating over coming to the city. That is reflected in the empty flats near universities. At Harbour Place in Hung Hom, a private estate with 2,527 flats near PolyU and popular among mainland students, 40 flats are available for rent – double the number from this time last year, said Alanlie Wong, senior sales manager of Midland Realty. “Normally by now, we would receive one or two enquiries a day since mainland students would be looking for flats for the new semester, but no one has approached us so far,” Wong said. PolyU was the scene of ugly clashes last month between radical protesters and police, who locked down the campus for 13 days and arrested about 1,100 people. Wong said the monthly rent for some 590 sq ft three-room flats at Harbour Place had come down from HK$28,000 to around HK$24,000. Property consultant James Lau of Ricacorp knew of two cases last month of mainland students cancelling their one-year lease to go home, after being in their flats for just about four months. They were so determined to go, they forfeited eight months’ rent of about HK$180,000 paid in advance. “The owner was happy,” Lau said. Trashed university in Hong Kong ‘will take more than six months to repair’ 30 Nov 2019 Trashed university in Hong Kong ‘will take more than six months to repair’ 30 Nov 2019 Near CUHK, two major private residential estates, Festival City in Tai Wai, and City One in Sha Tin, have 120 empty flats and no takers, agents said. Paul Chow, sales manager of Midland Realty, said many owners were willing to offer discounts after protests hit the university last month. A three-bedroom apartment is now going for $22,000 a month, 10 per cent less than last month. He is not optimistic that the mainland student market will pick up any time soon, given the lack of takers for available flats and the absence of enquiries. On Hong Kong Island, more than 30 flats popular with non-local students are vacant in the old tenements near the University of Hong Kong. A property agent said the owners are willing to lower the rent to draw clients. Some mainlanders already in Hong Kong are looking for new flatmates. “One of our roommates decided to return to the mainland, so her room is available for rent for $6,000 per month,” said CUHK student Jing, who shares a flat in Festival City with four others and asked to be identified by her first name only. The CUHK campus in Sha Tin was occupied by radical protesters for five days last month, during which the mob dropped objects from a bridge at the university onto the Tolo Highway and railway tracks below. During the clashes, police responded by firing 2,300 rounds of tear gas and deployed water cannon too. Some mainland students there were so frightened they requested help and left by police boat from a pier near the campus. Dou Roukin, a physics doctoral student and president of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association of CUHK, has decided to return to continue his studies. “Some students are worried about food safety, as the university was affected by tear gas, while some worry about anti-mainland sentiments on campus,” he said. But he added that many have no choice but to stay, having paid their costly tuition fees. “I still have two more years to go before graduation,” he said.

Police said they had found 34 petrol bombs, 20 smoke bombs, 12 corrosive bombs and a number of easily flammable items after receiving a call from university staff about suspected dangerous items on the Kowloon campus. Universities, including CityU, are gradually reopening their campuses after shutting down during a week of intense clashes between radical protesters and police as part of a citywide strike in November. CityU on Saturday said it had increased security at all entrances after being vandalised. It also said part of the library would reopen for use on Monday. Hong Kong has been gripped by six months of protests triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, which would have allowed fugitives to be sent to mainland China, but later spiralled into a wider anti-government movement. The university also discovered “dangerous chemicals” on campus last Friday, which were disposed of by police’s explosive ordnance disposal bureau.  In a statement to the Post, police said the case was being dealt with by officers from Sham Shui Po Police Station. Post During the violence in November, radicals vandalised CityU's main administrative building, destroyed the president’s office, and broke into laboratories.  Other places on the Kowloon Tong campus were damaged and set on fire on different days. Roadblocks were set up outside the university’s student residence as protesters heeded calls for citywide traffic disruptions. Police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd while radicals hurled petrol bombs.

The university later reported dangerous chemicals missing from its labs, including toxic, corrosive and flammable substances such as concentrated nitric acid, and concentrated sulphuric acid. Chinese University and Polytechnic University also reported missing chemicals. After the strike, 8,000 petrol bombs were found at Chinese University, which was the site of intense clashes on November 12, with protesters hurling petrol bombs, and police firing more than 1,000 rounds of tear gas into the campus. At PolyU, where protesters barricaded themselves inside for almost two weeks, 3,800 petrol bombs were found after radicals left. 	SCMP

Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung also said police would fully cooperate with the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) and let members interview any officer they wished to see. “The chief executive and police commissioner have promised to cooperate 100 per cent,” Cheung said. “Whichever police officer [the council] want to see, they will be happy to cooperate, there will be no refusal.” Cheung also responded to a question from the media on whether it was possible to grant more power to the council. A five-member panel of international experts said on Wednesday it would “formally stand aside from its role” after its request for more investigative powers to be granted to the council was denied. The council presently has no legal powers to issue subpoenas for documents and witnesses for its investigation.  “On the issue of [the council’s] powers, whether the council will review its role, this could be the next step of their work,” Cheung said. “But I think the most practical work for [the government] is to wait for the report.” Cheung did not elaborate on what the review could entail, and the Post has reached out to his office for comment. Post  The council’s report of the policing of the ongoing protests sparked by the government’s now-withdrawn extradition bill is expected to be submitted to the chief executive by the end of December, and to be published in late January at the earliest.  The first report will cover events up to July 1. Democratic Party lawmaker Helena Wong Pik-wan, a former council member, said Cheung’s claim that the watchdog would be able to summon any officer was untrue. “We don’t know which officer is sent where,” Wong said. “If the police do not arrange for the relevant officers to be interviewed, it will affect the council’s investigation.” Wong said interviewees would not be speaking under oath in front of the council. “How much the officers will tell you is up to them,” Wong said. Wong also said the council’s powers were stipulated in the Independent Police Complaints Council Ordinance, and those powers were unlikely to change unless the government proposed an amendment to the ordinance. Instead, Wong said the government should just launch a commission of inquiry that has the statutory powers to summon witnesses and request documents from relevant parties. Separately, Secretary for Labour and Welfare Law Chi-kwong said there was no timeline for the establishment of an independent review committee into the social unrest, or who will be drafted onto the panel.

But a number of its neighbourhoods have recently been battered by civil unrest. Nathan Road, Prince Edward MTR station, Mong Kok Police Station and Polytechnic University have all been seriously affected by anti-government protests, now in their seventh month. The area now has pro-democracy, anti-government graffiti scrawled across walls, gaping holes in pavements where protesters ripped out bricks to block roads or hurl at police, and signs of damage to shops and MTR stations that were vandalised or torched. Once a bustling area packed day and night with tourists and shoppers, it is quieter now. Fiona Sun looks at Yau Tsim Mong district, and the impact of the protests. Fiona Sun Where is Yau Tsim Mong district? Where is Yau Tsim Mong district? One of Hong Kong’s 18 districts, Yau Tsim Mong is in the southern part of the Kowloon peninsula, and named after its three main neighbourhoods – Yau Ma Tei, Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok. With a gross land area of about 7 sq km and a population of 342,970 according to the 2016 by-census, it has a population density of 49,046 people per square kilometre, second to Kwun Tong district’s 57,530 people per square kilometre.  Apart from a Chinese majority, the district is home to about 53,300 non-Chinese, or 16 per cent of the total. The largest ethnic minority groups are Nepalis, Filipinos, Indonesians and Indians. Originally called Yau Ma Tei district, it was renamed Yau Tsim in 1988, to clear the misconception that Tsim Sha Tsui was a separate district. In 1994, it merged with Mong Kok district to take its current form. What are the district’s landmarks? What are the district’s landmarks? Harbour City on the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront is Hong Kong’s largest shopping mall, spanning 2 million sq ft. With more than 450 shops, 70 food and drink outlets, an art gallery, an observation deck, three hotels and a cruise terminal, it is a tourist magnet all year round. In August, the newest local mall, K11 Musea, opened in the heart of Victoria Dockside with 1.2 million sq ft of luxury shopping over 10 floors.  Walking distance from the luxury malls are some of the city’s oldest street markets. Traders at the Temple Street Night Market in Yau Ma Tei sell everything from cheap electronic products to clothes, jade and antiques, while fortune tellers and Cantonese opera performances attract their own crowd too. Mong Kok’s Ladies’ Market draws crowds to more than 100 stalls along a 1km stretch.  The 17-storey Chungking Mansions opened in 1961 and gained notoriety as centre of drugs, criminal activity and illegal immigrants. Immortalised in the 1994 Wong Kar-wai film Chungking Express, the place is today a hub of budget hotels and restaurants that cater to tourists and locals, and a gathering place for ethnic-minority residents. Chungking Express Tsim Sha Tsui’s major arts attractions include the Hong Kong Cultural Centre, Museum of Art, Science Museum, Space Museum and Museum of History. The West Kowloon Cultural District, built on reclaimed land west of Yau Ma Tei, is a major cultural infrastructure investment that has been plagued by delays and controversy. Yau Tsim Mong is a major transport intersection, with MTR lines, the Cross-Harbour Tunnel and Western Harbour Tunnel linking Kowloon with Hong Kong Island. The Star Ferry, which has been crossing Victoria Harbour since 1888, is still going strong. The newest addition is the West Kowloon terminal of the cross-border high-speed rail link, which opened in September last year and connects the city with mainland Chinese mega-cities Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Other landmarks include the 44-metre red-brick-and-granite Clock Tower, the last vestige of the former terminal of the mostly demolished Kowloon-Canton Railway station, built in 1915, and the historic Tin Hau Temple in Yau Ma Tei, built around 1864 to honour Tin Hau, goddess of the sea.

How has Yau Tsim Mong figured in the protests? Various places in the district have been common protest sites. A 3.6km strip of Nathan Road between Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok has been the scene of regular protests, including violent clashes between protesters and the police. Lined with malls, shops and restaurants, the area has taken a beating from more than six months of protests. Shoppers who once thronged the area have been put off by the disruption, graffiti, ripped-up pavements and damaged MTR stations. Prince Edward MTR station has become a flashpoint for protests since August 31, when police entered the station. Protesters allege that, once inside, they beat passengers indiscriminately. Demonstrators have engaged in frequent stand-offs and clashes with officers from the nearby Mong Kok Police Station. The city’s biggest mosque, Kowloon Mosque in Tsim Sha Tsui, was affected on October 20, when a police water cannon involved in clearing the streets sprayed blue dye on the mosque’s steps and fence, and a handful of people outside. The incident sparked criticism of the police, and city leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and then commissioner of police Stephen Lo Wai-chung went there to apologise to local Muslims. In November, Hong Kong Polytechnic University saw the worst clashes after more than 1,000 radical protesters and their supporters occupied its Hung Hom campus. They blocked and damaged entrances and toll booths of the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, which had to be shut for two weeks. They set fire to nearby bridges and attacked the police with petrol bombs and bows and arrows, setting fire to an armoured vehicle and piercing an officer’s calf with an arrow. The police sealed all campus exits. The 13-day stand-off ended with more than 1,100 people arrested and extensive damage to the campus, which will take half a year to repair. Nearly US$128 million spent on police overtime pay since protests broke out 13 Dec 2019 Nearly US$128 million spent on police overtime pay since protests broke out 13 Dec 2019 What impact have protests had? What impact have protests had? The political unrest has taken a toll on the district’s tourism, cultural and retail scene, as well as its image. According to the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, protests between August 1 and December 1 forced the Science Museum to close for 19 days, as well as closing the Hong Kong Cultural Centre and Museum of History for 17 days and the Space Museum for 16. The Hong Kong Museum of Art was forced to close on December 1, just a day after reopening following more than four years of expansion and renovation work. Hong Kong’s visitor arrivals have plunged, with official figures for October showing a 43.7 per cent drop year on year to 3.31 million – the worst decline in a single month since May 2003, during the outbreak of the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome, or Sars. Ice cream seller Wong, 73, who asked to be identified by his surname only, says his sales are down 70 per cent at the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront. “Long queues of people buying ice cream used to be a common sight, but now fewer people come here,” he says. Things have never been worse, says Wong, who has been selling ice cream for more than 40 years. He says he has lost more income than during the Sars outbreak, which did not last as long as the ongoing turmoil. English tourists Nicholas Griffiths, 34, and Catherine Curran, 29, stayed in Hong Kong for four days on their way to New Zealand. “We were aware of the situation. It’s all over the news,” Curran said. They arrived on December 1, when a march was held by thousands of protesters from Tsim Sha Tsui to Hung Hom and police fired tear gas and projectiles to disperse the crowds. “The protests definitely affect our travelling experience here,” Curran said. “We’ll just be aware of the situation, and avoid protests.” Can the district recover? Can the district recover? Derek Chu Kong-wai, a newly elected Yau Tsim Mong District Council member, says the broken traffic lights and ripped-up pavements make it inconvenient for residents, especially the elderly and disabled, to get around. Repairs, mainly along Nathan Road, Argyle Street and Sai Yee Street, are under way, he says. The Transport Department expects repair work to be completed by this month, he adds. Chu says the key to restoring the district lies in resolving Hong Kong’s political unrest. “The city is facing a big problem,” he says. “Regardless of different political views, people hope the government and those who have the capability to solve the problem will do so as soon as possible.” 	SCMP

They connected on the dating app Bumble, met, and got along so well the Hongkonger, who works in human resources, thought he might be heading for a serious relationship. Within weeks, however, it was over. She sent him a curt text message saying: “I don’t want to continue any more.” Though disappointed, Joe (not his real name) guessed it was because he had revealed he was anti-police and “light yellow” – on the side of pro-democracy protesters, as opposed to “blue” pro-establishment supporters. Thousands of Hongkongers pay homage to deceased student Chow Tsz-lok Thousands of Hongkongers pay homage to deceased student Chow Tsz-lok “I never thought my political views would get in the way of my dating life,” he says. With Hong Kong’s anti-government movement now into its seventh month, singles seeking dates online have begun stating their political views, some making it plain they are not interested in people from the opposite camp.  “I feel that revealing your political stance has become a must on these apps,” says Joe, whose Bumble profile now states that he is not looking to meet anyone who supports the police. “It’s like we now have another filter.” Where people previously described themselves, the kind of movies or songs they enjoyed, or what they were looking for in an ideal date, more now state their political preferences. Local university applications from Hong Kong school leavers hit new low 13 Dec 2019 Local university applications from Hong Kong school leavers hit new low 13 Dec 2019 Phrases such as “No blue ribbons” or “No yellow ribbons” are common on profiles. It is not uncommon to see protest slogans such as: “Add oil, Hongkongers.” Some even post photos of themselves at protests.  The trend has caught on among users of dating platforms like Tinder, OkCupid and Coffee Meets Bagel, among others. Tinder was ranked first by Hongkongers for fame and respectability, according to a 2017 survey conducted by YouGov. It also found that four in 10 citizens used online dating apps, including almost one in two millennials.  Matchmaker Yubi Wong Ka-yu, founder of HK Romance Dating, which helps people meet face-to-face with no dating apps, is concerned about the latest development. “People can be much less vigilant when someone claiming to be on the same side politically approaches them,” she says.  “Everyone can see your profile on dating apps, and scammers might make use of that to get to you,” she cautions. Political stance reflects one’s logical thinking and how one judges what is right and wrong. So when huge social events happen, people have the chance to think about how different their values are, even at the early stage of a relationship. There is no way to dodge political discussion any more Frank Leung, psychologist and counsellor Looking back, Joe believes he got rejected because his date knew too many couples who argued over politics and did not want to end up that way too. He says they discussed politics only when they met in person and, over dinner, she mentioned that she was “neutral” as far as the protests were concerned. “But it was still quite a happy date, as we avoided judging who’s right and who’s wrong,” he recalls. They stayed in touch for another two weeks, until Joe posted a message on Facebook saying: “You should unfriend me if you support the police”. He backs the protesters’ allegations that the police use excessive violence when dispersing crowds, a charge the force denies. His date was one of those who blocked him on Facebook. She then told him it was over between them. Joe says he has been on dating apps for two years and used to care very little about potential matches’ political views. He was more interested in their lifestyle, and whether they were heavy drinkers or had a “crazy nightlife”. While he thinks hooking up with someone who is a “yellow ribbon” like him will give them one thing in common, he does not believe political preferences should be the deciding factor, “as long as we agree on where to put it in the relationship”. Tinder user Ben (not his real name) says the first thing he checks these days is a potential date’s position on the protests. “If she’s ‘blue’, I won’t bother to chat further,” says the 25-year-old university graduate. Before the protests, he says, he assessed potential dates by their looks, hobbies and interests. Now his profile reveals personal information and his favourite songs, but also protest statements such as “Liberate Hong Kong; Revolution of our times” and “This life, I will only marry yellow ribbons and frontline protesters”. “Having different political stances means we don’t have shared values,” he says. “It’s better to let the other person know who I am at the very beginning.” Coming from a pro-establishment family, Ben tries to avoid confrontation with his parents. “When I go to protests, I just tell them I’m out eating or shopping,” he says. “With a ‘yellow’ girlfriend, I will have someone to go through thick and thin with me.” Yubi Wong, whose matchmaking company has about 20,000 members mostly aged between 28 and 36, says: “Stating political views used to be scarce on the dating scene. Very few Hong Kong people used to ask about that.” Traditionally, Hong Kong singles looked mainly for partners with similar income and education background. “Due to pressure from parents, such criteria were more important than having similar lifestyles or habits,” Wong says. She estimates that about 10 per cent of her clients now ask to filter out people from the opposite political camp. In a sense, Wong adds, the rise of political awareness in the dating scene also reflects the city’s strong family values. “They think about establishing a family and how to educate their children. Many feel that this will go more smoothly if they know their partner’s political views beforehand,” she says.   Wong says she advises clients to avoid “sensitive topics” on their first three dates, and these include asking about previous relationships, religion and politics. “The key is not to impose your view on the other, and try to find common ground,” she says. “After all, love is about tolerance and understanding.” Frank Leung King-wai, a psychologist and counsellor, says love-seeking young Hongkongers always attached great importance to personality and values, and the ongoing protests have raised their awareness of checking on the latter. “Political stance reflects one’s logical thinking and how one judges what is right and wrong,” he says. “So when huge social events happen, people have the chance to think about how different their values are, even at the early stage of a relationship. There is no way to dodge political discussion any more.” Discussing these matters can be a positive thing for those who are dating, and may even reduce the possibility of future conflict. IPCC rejected experts’ request to comment on Hong Kong protest report 12 Dec 2019 IPCC rejected experts’ request to comment on Hong Kong protest report 12 Dec 2019 “When it comes to topics such as whether the use of violence is good or not, it is particularly hard to argue or make the other accept your view,” he adds. “But if two people are mature and rational enough to find common ground, it can help them to grow closer.” Hongkonger Sulley, 24, and her Singaporean boyfriend Mike, 30 (not their real names) have had to work their way through these issues. They met on OkCupid this year and are in a long-distance relationship, with him visiting Hong Kong several times to see her. Describing herself as “anti-police but peaceful, rational and non-violent”, she says: “I knew that he had been in the army, so it’s natural for him to be more pro-establishment. But I don’t think it is that big a problem.” The couple recall getting into an argument when they were at Nathan Road in Tsim Sha Tsui one day, and saw police chasing a group of protesters. Sulley, who had witnessed similar clashes, did not want to walk closer to the scene. “I am very non-confrontational, and I wanted my man to respect that,” she says. Mike, who happened to be wearing a black T-shirt, the colour of the protesters’ garb, saw no reason to walk away. “I don’t understand why you need to be afraid of the police if you haven’t done anything bad,” he says. They talked about their disagreement later and were able to move on and even joke about it. “It’s not like our personal views about the protest or politics define who we are,” Sulley says. Mike says that despite their differences, he never avoids talking about Hong Kong politics with Sulley. “Being partners means you share about things, however complicated it could get,” he says. “You just need to be patient enough, and agree to disagree. And that’s how we click.” 	SCMP

The “shocked and livid” 27-year-old, who gave his name as Fu Jai, said he was walking home through Mong Kok when he was hit with what he believed to be a pepper ball fired by an officer. A spokeswoman for the force said they used “minimum force” to disperse the unlawful assembly on Tuesday.

Post “I will engage lawyers to explore my next steps, including taking them to court to get justice,” the air conditioner maintenance worker said.  “Of course I want to know the name of the officer involved and why he shot me, given I was not involved in any protests or committed any violent acts towards them [police] that night.” Fu Jai is at least the third person suffering eye injuries after allegedly being shot by a police weapon since the anti-government protests erupted in Hong Kong six months ago. anti-government protests  A young woman said she was hit by a beanbag round in her right eye in August during clashes between police and protesters in Tsim Sha Tsui, while Indonesian journalist Veby Mega Indah was blinded in one eye by a projectile fired by police during a dispersal operation in Wan Chai in September. hit by a beanbag round blinded in one eye Sparked in June by fierce opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill, the demonstrations, many of which have descended into violence, have developed into an anti-government movement demanding the revival of the city’s stalled political reform process and an independent investigation into police conduct at protests. now-withdrawn extradition bill   Girl, 13, who burned Chinese flag during protest gets 12 months’ probation 13 Dec 2019 Girl, 13, who burned Chinese flag during protest gets 12 months’ probation 13 Dec 2019 He said up to seven riot police and Special Tactical Squad officers, known as “Raptors”, stood on nearby Nathan Road, holding but not raising a blue flag that warned protesters to disperse or face force, while shouting at people to leave. “I was slowly walking away with 10 or so pedestrians, when suddenly the officers charged at us with one yelling loudly,” Fu Jai said. “Startled by the loud voice, I turned around and was immediately shot at close range with a pepper ball in the eye. “I felt stinging and it was very painful, and I could not open both of my eyes. The officers had run away before I could see their faces or warrant numbers.”   He said he was not wearing a mask or googles, and was dressed in a grey coat and trainers. Video clips circulating online show a group of pedestrians pushed and on the receiving end of pepper spray and balls, with some falling to the ground. Fu Jai was taken via ambulance to Kwong Wah Hospital in Yau Ma Tei before being transferred to Caritas Medical Centre in Sham Shui Po for eye surgery under anaesthesia for a ruptured eyeball and internal bleeding. Police’s pepper spray use under fire but force insiders defend officers 3 Nov 2019 Police’s pepper spray use under fire but force insiders defend officers 3 Nov 2019 After an operation, he said he was still suffering from blurred vision, and could not open his eye fully under sunlight. “My eye looks a bit lopsided to the left now, and my physicians were still uncertain about the long term ramifications. I dread to think if I would suffer a permanent loss of sight.” Pepper balls contain chemical irritants similar to those found in pepper spray and are fired from non-lethal guns. Jeffrey Pong Chiu-fai, a specialist in ophthalmology who has seen the patient’s notes, said a rupture and laceration in the eye globe and cornea was likely in Fu Jai’s case, which would result in at least a 10 to 20 per cent permanent loss of vision. “Eye rupture is a serious injury and it appears the impact at close range was strong. Recovery will depend on whether there is any future infection, which can even spread from one eye to another,” Pong said.

I never thought an innocent person like me would get attacked in this way.”   A police spokeswoman said that at the time of the incident protesters had gathered at an unlawful assembly and blocked roads in Mong Kok, including Shantung Street, Portland Street and Nathan Road.

A girl, 15, and her 16-year-old boyfriend were among those arrested in relation to a fight that broke out between two groups in Lung Wan Street, Sheung Shui, on November 13. Police said in a statement in the early hours on Saturday that three men and two women, aged 15 to 18, were arrested in suspected connection with a murder case and had been detained at the New Territories North Regional Headquarters in Tai Po for further inquiries. “After investigation, the three men and two women were arrested in Sheung Shui and Tai Po for murder, taking part in a riot and wounding,” the statement read. Son of 70-year-old killed by brick during protest calls for peace Son of 70-year-old killed by brick during protest calls for peace Police offered an HK$800,000 (US$102,000) reward for information on the killer of cleaner Luo Changqing earlier this week. The bounty is the largest posted on the force's website. But a police source said the arrests were made based on officers' own investigation and had nothing to do with the tips generated from the offer of a reward.  “We have swept a lot of CCTV and online clips, which showed the five suspects’ presence in the area,” the source said. “Although no clips showing the five threw bricks directly at the deceased man, some did throw bricks and wound others. They could have acted in joint enterprise when it comes to the murder case. We will seek further legal advice.”  The “joint enterprise” principle allows for accomplices of the one who strikes the fatal blow in a murder to be convicted of the same crime.  He said the arrested boyfriend had hurled bricks at a 61-year-old man whose left eye retina was damaged. Chaos erupted during a heated argument on November 13 outside North District Town Hall between about 20 black-clad protesters and Sheung Shui residents, who had been clearing bricks left on the street earlier by activists.   Online video footage showed the two sides had been throwing bricks at each other when Luo, who was taking pictures at the scene, was hit on the head and fell to the ground. The contract cleaner for the government was certified dead in hospital at 10.51pm the next day, on November 14. Liam Lam Tsz-king, a North District councillor-elect, said the family of a 16-year-old boy approached her on Friday after his arrest and she helped them find a lawyer.

The incident on November 13 lasted about one minute before the black-clad gang opened umbrellas to shield themselves and began their retreat. Police searched the area, but no arrests were made at the scene. After the elderly man’s death, the central government's liaison office in Hong Kong expressed its “deep condolences” and urged Hongkongers to “denounce violence and protect the rule of law and stability of society together”.

Most airlines in the city have already pared back their flight schedules for as late as March, the figures from the Air International Air Transport Association (IATA) reveal, which could amount to millions of fewer seats going on sale. The decision by carriers to reduce the availability of tickets for Hong Kong flights well into next year comes after the sector has been hammered by six months of ongoing anti-government protests. anti-government protests Hong Kong received 2.3 million fewer passengers between August and October compared with the same period last year. Tourist arrivals in October alone plunged 43.7 per cent. The new data from IATA, obtained by the Post, shows there are 10 per cent fewer seats up for sale in November and December year over year, which is more than double the level of earlier cuts highlighted in late October. Post  There is also a 6 to 8 per cent reduction in the number of seats offered from January to March next year, meaning airlines will suffer reduced sales deep into 2020 even if the anti-government demonstrations ease off in the new year. Alexandre de Juniac, IATA director general and CEO, said Hong Kong International Airport – one of the biggest air transport hubs in Asia – had been “severely affected”, which he said justified a speedy roll-out of concessions from the government for passenger airlines.  Speaking to the Post at an annual meeting with journalists in Geneva, he said Hong Kong would feel the “positive effect” of reductions in charges, which could include landing and parking fees. Post  Almost every airline flying out of HKIA has cut flights, including Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Qantas and United Airlines. Cathay Pacific cut its seat capacity by up to 7 per cent for November and December, and by 1.4 per cent in 2020. Airlines in mainland China lead fresh cull of Hong Kong flights amid protests 18 Nov 2019 Airlines in mainland China lead fresh cull of Hong Kong flights amid protests 18 Nov 2019 New data from Cathay Pacific and the airport on their respective performance in November is due in the coming days, and is likely to show another sharp decline in passenger numbers. According to a report of CAPA Centre for Aviation, an international research company on global aviation news, Hong Kong airport’s seat capacity was down 12 per cent year over year for the week of December 2.   Hong Kong Airlines, beset by financial troubles, cut its seat capacity for the week of December 2 by 18.4 per cent, wiping out its growth for the past three years. The Cathay Pacific Group is also managing a decline of 3.8 per cent. beset by financial troubles “Demand should begin to return to previous levels if the protests – or at least headline-grabbing violent incidents – subside. Traffic from mainland China could take longer to recover, however,” the CAPA report concluded. Luya You, a transportation analyst at Bocom International, said there was no end in sight for the “free fall” in arrivals. “If the unrest extends significantly beyond the first quarter of 2020, for example, we believe airlines with substantial Hong Kong-based operations may even cut routes outright,” You said. No relief measures for airlines at Hong Kong airport despite protests 18 Nov 2019 No relief measures for airlines at Hong Kong airport despite protests 18 Nov 2019 A report from Bocom concluded that transit passengers had saved Hong Kong from a larger collapse in air traffic. “HKIA’s position as one of the most connected hubs in the world provides some assurance to airlines, as key routes and transit volumes won’t be diverted in the short term, in our view,” You added. You warned that although the drop of tourism arrivals is less than the reduction recorded during the three-month severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) health crisis in 2003, consecutive 30 to 40 per cent drops in tourism arrivals over many months could be more “devastating” than steeper 60 per cent falls over three months. Hong Kong citywide strike hits international airport, stranding travellers Hong Kong citywide strike hits international airport, stranding travellers IATA said the government should be well aware of the “effect” that charge reductions for airlines had in the wake of Sars in encouraging passengers to return to Hong Kong with cheaper fares. Ronald Lam Siu-por, chairman of the Board of Airline Representatives and Cathay Pacific chief customer and commercial officer, said: “We would definitely welcome relief measures by the Hong Kong government so that airlines operating in Hong Kong can maintain viability through this extremely difficult time … as a global aviation hub.” Hong Kong’s airport authority, airlines to offer discounts on cargo charges 11 Dec 2019 Hong Kong’s airport authority, airlines to offer discounts on cargo charges 11 Dec 2019 The Civil Aviation Department had earlier said it would not take back runway slots from airlines up to at least March 28, making it easier for carriers to suspend flights amid the drop in demand. Flight schedules for the summer season from March 29 until late October are due to be unveiled soon, which could indicate the levels of confidence airlines have in the Hong Kong market over the longer term. Mass demonstrations against the now-withdrawn extradition bill, which sparked a wave of unrest in June, have morphed into a broader anti-government movement, fuelled by allegations of police brutality and the campaign for more democracy. now-withdrawn extradition bill 	SCMP

The sentence at Tuen Mun Court meant the Form Two student, who could not be named for legal reasons, would be left with a criminal record, after she committed the offence during a demonstration approved by police on September 21. The girl’s lawyer Douglas Kwok King-hin had urged the court to exercise its discretion and give the girl one more chance by passing a sentence that would maintain her clear criminal record. But magistrate Kelly Shui accepted the recommendation made by the girl’s probation officer and sentenced her to probation. She told the pupil: “The court cannot pass a lenient sentence every time because you are young. The court has its duties.” Hong Kong protester who desecrated Chinese flag ‘out of fun’ gets 200 hours of community service 29 Oct 2019 Hong Kong protester who desecrated Chinese flag ‘out of fun’ gets 200 hours of community service 29 Oct 2019 The girl was the second Hong Kong protester to be convicted of desecrating the national flag, and by far the youngest to plead guilty to flag-related charges during the anti-government protests that had gripped the city for over half a year. anti-government protests The court heard at 3.43pm that day, the girl and two unknown protesters had pulled down the national flag outside Tuen Mun Town Hall. She then set fire to the flag with a lighter.  The incident was captured by the press, allowing police to identify the girl. Officers followed the girl to a shopping centre in Sham Tseng and arrested her, according to prosecutors. At the previous hearing on November 22, Kwok told the court the girl had no premeditated plan to burn the flag, but was caught up in the march and influenced by other protesters. He also said the girl and her parents had been subjected to harassment online and she had received anonymous threats of rape, kidnap and even murder. She did not dare to take part in other public events, the lawyer added.  On Friday, Kwok said the girl had a “detailed” discussion with the probation officer, who was satisfied that a probation period could help correct her impulsive behaviour. He submitted two letters written by her school principal and football coach, who described her as a student of good conduct. You should not be ignorant of the fact that some people have lost their freedom over their convictions Magistrate Kelly Shui In passing the sentence, Shui reminded the girl to think twice every time before she acted. She also warned that the girl might face jail the next time she committed a more serious offence.  “The social movement currently has no end in sight … You may be swayed one way or another by others. This is very dangerous,” Shui said. “You should not be ignorant of the fact that some people have lost their freedom over their convictions. You don’t want that to happen to you as well.” Shui also ordered the girl to follow the order of the probation officer in participating in community work, group counselling and rehabilitation programmes. The girl must also obey a curfew between 7.30pm and 7am every day, unless she went out at night in her parents’ company or otherwise permitted by the officer.

The amount was disclosed on Friday in a Security Bureau paper to the Legislative Council as lawmakers met to scrutinise the government’s funding request for a pay rise for civil servants. Opposition pan-democratic politicians had asked the administration to remove police from the funding request, arguing that there should be a separate discussion on pay rises for the 30,000-strong force, which has come under fire from some quarters over its handling of anti-government protests since June. anti-government protests The ongoing protests have stretched the Hong Kong Police Force to the limit, and the government has been trying to cope by recruiting “special constables” from other disciplined services, including the Correctional Services Department. Hong Kong Police Force Sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, the protests have developed into a wider anti-government movement, with escalating levels of violence as radicals clash with police. extradition bill In the government paper, the Security Bureau revealed that in each of the past six months, about 11,000 police officers had received a Disciplined Services Overtime Allowance (DSOA).  “The relevant expenditure in total was approximately HK$950 million,” it read. That would mean each of the 11,000 officers received HK$14,394 a month on average in overtime pay since June.  Legco approved the government’s 2019-20 budget in May, including a provision of around HK$20.2 billion for police salaries, allowances and other operating expenses. The paper said the financial secretary could seek more funding if the approved provision was not enough. In the 2018-19 year, police spending was HK$19.5 billion.   The bureau also noted there were rules in place on overtime payments.  “Time off in lieu is the normal recompense for OT work performed … Where the granting of time off is, or is likely to be, impracticable within 30 days of the date on which OT work is performed, payment of DSOA to eligible officers may be approved,” it said. The bureau also said while the maximum amount of overtime work a civil servant could undertake was normally 60 hours a month, the force had adjusted the ceiling. But it did not elaborate further. A police source said the overtime ceiling for operation Tiderider, launched in June to target anti-government protests, was capped at 150 hours per month. Officers of chief inspector rank or below could earn overtime pay, which was calculated by the hour based on their salary, while superintendents or above would only receive compensation leave. A chief inspector, who has been on the protest front lines since June, said he worked an extra 150 hours each month on top of 190 regular hours. His monthly salary was around HK$100,000 but he earned an extra HK$60,000 a month, or HK$360,000 in total, since June. But the extra money could not compensate for the extreme physical and mental exhaustion, he said, and he would rather not work overtime. “We are not talking about working overtime for a week, but six months non-stop. There are so many times I’ve worked a 36-hour shift and I have also missed my son’s and wife’s birthdays,” he said. “HK$1 billion sounds massive. But we didn’t cheat to get the money. It is hard-earned money. We are exposed to life-threatening risks and doxxing. I would rather go back to my normal shift and my normal life.” New People’s Party chairwoman Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, a veteran pro-establishment politician and former security chief, said the overtime pay was a result of an unusually large number – more than 900 – of public order events this year. “Police have to serve very long shifts, it is only reasonable that people are compensated for the work they do. I believe police would rather society was peaceful and they worked less overtime,” she said. But opposition lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting said the pan-democrat camp would “use all means” to stop the government paying the overtime allowance to police, or giving them a pay rise. “Over the past six months, police have been involved in numerous incidents of abuse of violence and power,” the Democratic Party lawmaker said. “It is absolutely unacceptable for the public that the government now requests that police are paid an OT fee with public money.” Council Front lawmaker Au Nok-hin also called for a review of the financial secretary’s power to seek unlimited overtime payments for civil servants. Meanwhile, at the Legco Finance Committee meeting on Friday, pan-democrats urged the government to send representatives from the police force to answer their questions. “It is not only us who have grievances, but over half of citizens have given police a zero score,” Democratic Party chairman Wu Chi-wai said, referring to a poll by a local university. “It is just reasonable for police representatives to come to Legco and address our concerns.”   But Secretary for the Civil Service Joshua Law Chi-kong rejected the calls, saying lawmakers should not consider the performance of the civil service in the meeting. “Lawmakers have other channels including the civil service panel to follow up on the performance issue,” he said. “We are handling a livelihood issue here, the issue of the pay scale for all of the civil service.” Pan-democrat lawmaker Gary Fan Kwok-wai urged all citizens to recognise the faces of pro-establishment lawmakers who rejected the need to have police attend the meeting. “It is you who are sending bullets to police who shoot Hongkongers and create a humanitarian crisis in the city,” he said. The pro-establishment camp fought back, with lawmaker Priscilla Leung Mei-fun saying police had ensured the safety of Hongkongers amid the violence of rioters. Pro-establishment legislator Holden Chow Ho-ding accused the pan-democrats of destroying Hong Kong’s systems. He said his camp was dissatisfied with the Education Bureau, as it had failed to punish teachers who incited hatred in society, but the bloc would not pinpoint a particular authority in scrutinising the funding request. “If all departments are required to attend the meeting, the funding cannot be passed for a long time,” he said. The bloc shot down pan-democrats’ demands, but Ted Hui Chi-fung further requested that Commissioner of Police Chris Tang Ping-keung be summoned to the meeting. In the afternoon session of the meeting, lawmakers engaged in a debate over the procedure for summoning officials to meetings. Tang did not appear.

The story buttressed a main claim of the protesters, that Beijing was intervening heavily in the city’s affairs. A state-run newspaper denounced the story as “fake” and “shameful.” The article was quickly made inaccessible to readers in mainland China. It was not the Chinese government that blocked the story. The article was removed by Refinitiv, the financial information provider that distributes Reuters news to investors around the world on Eikon, a trading and analytics platform. The article was one of a growing number of stories that Refinitiv – which until last year was owned by Reuters’ parent company, Thomson Reuters – has censored in mainland China under pressure from the central government. Since August, Refinitiv has blocked more than 200 stories about the Hong Kong protests plus numerous other Reuters articles that could cast Beijing in an unfavourable light. Internal Refinitiv documents showed that over the summer, the company installed an automated filtering system to help with the censorship. The system included the creation of a code to attach to some China stories, called “restricted news”. As a result, Refinitiv’s customers in China have been denied access to coverage of one of the biggest news events of the year, including two Reuters reports on downgrades of Hong Kong by credit-rating agencies. Nearly 100 other news providers available on Eikon in China have also been affected by the filtering. Censorship in China has been intensifying in recent years under President Xi Jinping, and Western businesses have come under increasing pressure to block news, speech and products that Beijing deems politically dangerous. Refinitiv generates tens of millions of dollars of annual revenue in China. As Reuters reported in June, citing three sources, Refinitiv began the censorship effort this year after a regulator threatened to suspend its Chinese operation.  Refinitiv was formed last year when a consortium led by private equity giant Blackstone bought a 55 per cent stake in Thomson Reuters’ Financial & Risk business, which included the Eikon terminal business, for about US$20 billion and rebranded it. A new Chinese browser claims to let people legally visit foreign websites 15 Nov 2019 A new Chinese browser claims to let people legally visit foreign websites 15 Nov 2019 Refinitiv began ramping up its efforts to purge offending China coverage. Internal Refinitiv documents and emails described how the company over the summer created an automated filtering system – referred to as the “strategic China filter” – to block certain stories to Eikon users in mainland China. In July, Refinitiv’s news platform architecture director requested that a code be created, called restricted news, that could be added to articles. He asked that it “should be hidden for all users [internal and external],” according to notes from a conference call on July 17 where the code was discussed. One reason was that Refinitiv did not want to give its mainland China customers the ability to disable the filtering.  In an email to colleagues, the platform director explained the code: “The flag is to highlight news that requires additional processing, due to Chinese government restrictions, prior to consumption in China.” The filtering system is designed to block stories for readers in mainland China but allow them to be accessed in other markets. It looks for restricted keywords in headlines, such as “Hong Kong” and “protest”, a source said.  Refinitiv employees also discussed by email whether the restricted news code should be China-specific or “generic”, so it could be used to block stories in other countries. The email exchange indicated that they opted for a generic code. Reuters found no evidence that Refinitiv has deployed the filtering system in other nations. Refinitiv did not comment on whether it planned to use the restriction code elsewhere. Eikon users outside mainland China can retrieve stories about the Hong Kong protests by clicking on headlines, or by searching for keywords or codes. For users inside China, however, articles that are blocked bring up this message: “You do not have access to this story.” Editor of Global Times questions Beijing’s online censorship 19 Sep 2019 Editor of Global Times questions Beijing’s online censorship 19 Sep 2019 Refinitiv’s blocking of protest stories intensified after August 30, when Reuters reported that Beijing had rejected a bid by Lam to compromise with the protesters. Before that date, all but five of 246 Reuters articles that had run in 2019 containing the words “Hong Kong” and “protest” in the headline were accessible on the mainland. By contrast, between August 30 and November 20, Refinitiv blocked nearly four out of five such articles that Reuters filed – 196 out of 251. The censorship was especially heavy between September 4 and October 7, when all 104 Reuters articles containing those words in the headline were blocked. At the time, demonstrators were on the streets of the city and police responded with water cannon and rubber bullets. Refinitiv also censored potentially market-moving stories that would have been of interest to its core clientele of financial professionals. These included a September 6 report that Fitch Ratings had downgraded Hong Kong’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating. Also blocked were stories on the effect of the protests on stock prices and initial public offerings. Besides Reuters articles, the filtering has also blocked one or more stories from 97 other news providers that are available inside China on the Eikon system – including Xinhua, China’s official news agency. On December 3, Refinitiv blocked a Xinhua story about a small demonstration in Hong Kong by pro-Beijing residents. They were quoted heatedly denouncing Washington over a new United States law that gave support to Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protesters. Refinitiv chief executive David Craig and Thomson Reuters chief executive Jim Smith have held talks, as recently as this week, in an effort to resolve the issue, sources said. Smith “was very concerned” upon learning about Craig’s decision to impose the filtering, said a senior Thomson Reuters official. It was not clear how close the sides were to a solution both sides find agreeable, another source said. “We recognise that the processes that were put in place earlier this year need to be improved and are actively working on enhancements,” Refinitiv spokesman Patrick Meyer said of the filtering system. “As a global business, Refinitiv must comply with the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate. This is a challenge that not just Refinitiv faces, but also other companies and distributors of financial market information.” And news relevant to investors is still being censored. Eikon users in mainland China could not read this story soon after it was published. It was blocked. 	SCMP

Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor The Joint University Programme Admissions System (Jupas) – the main route for school leavers seeking entry to local tertiary institutions – on Thursday released figures on applications for the next academic year. Some 41,238 applications were received for the 2020 school year, down from 44,054 a year ago. Mainly because of a drop in the student population, applications have been falling steadily in recent years, from 69,172 for the 2013 school year to 46,346 for 2018. Lingnan University associate vice-president Professor Lau Chi-pang, said: “Some students may shun local universities because of the recent social disruption. Coupled with rumours that some local employers will avoid hiring those who graduate locally in coming years, it is possible the downward trend may continue.” Hong Kong Association of the Heads of Secondary Schools chairman Teddy Tang Chun-keung took a similar view. Hong Kong’s battered universities work to recover from protest turmoil 9 Dec 2019 Hong Kong’s battered universities work to recover from protest turmoil 9 Dec 2019 “Students from better-off families will tend more to go abroad to study,” Tang said. “For ordinary students, we have also heard that more have opted for courses that are better recognised overseas. Probably, students are planning to leave Hong Kong anyway after graduating from local universities.”  International education consultancy IDP said inquiries about studying abroad had increased by more than 10 per cent since the protests broke out in June. The main countries of interest were Britain, Australia and Canada. “The reasons for the increase in inquiries are varied and could include dissatisfaction with the education system, but we have seen an obvious rise since the social movement started,” IDP senior manager Calvin Chan Shing-kit said. Hong Kong's PolyU siege : From beginning to end Hong Kong's PolyU siege : From beginning to end He added the inquiries covered primary schools up to university.  “Those three countries tend to be more popular because Hongkongers may have family members there,” Chan said.  Ng Po-shing, a guidance consultant at student counselling group Hok Yau Club, however, said it was too early to jump to conclusions. “The downward trend in applications has continued in recent years, mainly because of a drop in the student population,” Ng said. “With fewer applicants, it also means competition will not be as keen. Last year, some students with 19 points got a university place. This year, 18 points might be good enough,” he said, referring to the grades a student needs in the Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE) examination to gain entry as a freshman. In 2016, some 36.3 per cent of DSE candidates met the minimum entry requirements for local universities. The proportion rose to 42.1 per cent in 2019. The protests, sparked in June by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, have morphed into a wider anti-government movement, with demonstrators demanding more democracy and an independent inquiry into police actions, among others. Protests have become increasingly violent, with radicals attacking police, vandalising and setting fire to shops, banks, and metro stations, and throwing petrol bombs. Last month, several universities were forced to close after they became battlegrounds as radical protesters clashed with riot police. At least three, City University, Polytechnic University and Chinese University, later reported to police that toxic, corrosive and flammable chemicals had been stolen. battlegrounds Education sector lawmaker Ip Kin-yuen urged Lam to act promptly to stop a potential exodus of talent. “The government should respond to the protesters’ demands so as to bring peace back to society. If peace is restored, people leaving will also consider returning.” Additional reporting by Zoe Low Additional reporting by Zoe Low 	SCMP

He did not elaborate. The promise of at least a ceasefire in the prolonged trade war delighted the investment community, as stocks surged soon after the tweet, with the S&P 500 hitting a record high.

Washington and Beijing had been expected to meet after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Santiago last month to sign the interim trade agreement, which would see China buy more US agricultural goods and increase intellectual property protections. But the plan to complete the deal fell through after the Apec meeting was cancelled and tensions between the two countries rose over the Hong Kong protests and China’s treatment of its Muslim ethnic Uygur people in Xinjiang region.

Post The revelation came after a five-member panel announced it was to “stand aside” from the Independent Police Complaints Council’s ongoing probe on Thursday, saying their dialogue “has not led to any agreed process”. Critics said the bombshell cast doubts over the credibility of the IPCC’s investigation, especially after the experts proposed giving the watchdog more power to launch a full investigation into officers’ conduct during the protests triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill. The IPCC is currently investigating the handling of major protests on June 9 and 12, July 1, August 1 and 31, as well as a mob attack on demonstrators and passengers at Yuen Long MTR station on July 21. But an “interim” report, due to be published in late January, would only focus on three dates: June 9 and 12 and July 1. It was unclear when the rest of the investigation would be completed. Tony Tse Wai-chuen, vice-chairman of the IPCC, said some members of the panel, made up of policing experts from Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, had their views about the report, including the issue of giving the watchdog the power to subpoena documents and witnesses.  But Tse said the council felt it was inappropriate to allow the panel to comment at this stage, especially when the experts had reservations about the strength of IPCC’s investigatory power.   “We can’t wait forever for comments to come back and then [ponder on] whether we should adopt them,” Tse said. “We just don’t have time.” According to Tse, the panel’s request for a schedule of the next round of investigation was also declined.  The experts said in a previous statement that they would be ready to support the IPCC, “if and when it develops the necessary capabilities and provides its interim report on the protests, confrontations and policing of events between June and September 2019”.  An IPCC spokesman said the interim report was not complete and would be available for the panel to comment when it was ready. All five panel members have either declined to comment further or not responded to requests for a reply. Lawmakers’ bid to deny police a pay rise challenged by unions 12 Dec 2019 Lawmakers’ bid to deny police a pay rise challenged by unions 12 Dec 2019 A separate source with knowledge of the situation said the IPCC was also wary about the risk of potential leaks. Tse said he personally believed the panel should only be involved once the report was finalised and ready for publication, adding it had been agreed that the experts’ views would be reflected. A third source said the IPCC had originally said it would allow panel members to comment at the same time as watchdog members. Violent clashes between Hong Kong protesters and police on July 1st Violent clashes between Hong Kong protesters and police on July 1st The government has rejected protesters’ demands to set up an independent commission of inquiry into alleged police brutality during the demonstrations, saying the established mechanism of the IPCC should be tasked with the job. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said in November that she would also set up an independent review committee, drawing experts to look into the underlying political and socio-economic reasons behind the unrest. Critics argued such a committee would not have the same powers to summon witnesses. A government source said the committee would not be the same as a commission of inquiry and was not likely to be announced before Christmas. A separate political source said the government had found it difficult to recruit members to lead the committee. Barrister Ronny Tong Ka-wah, an adviser in Lam’s de facto cabinet, the Executive Council, said he believed the government was considering all options. “An independent review committee and a commission of inquiry are not that different,” he said. “But society’s view is that you must deliver what we want. This is not a good way to solve conflict. I hope there will be an announcement after Lam’s duty visit to Beijing.” Another Exco member, Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, said the committee, with or without the power to subpoena, was no solution to unrest. “We should not encourage revenge … If we want to punish wrongdoing, we need to rely on our criminal justice system,” Ip said. Rather than dwelling on the power of the committees, more effort should be spent actually resolving social and economic issues, she added.

Chow Tsz-lok, a 22-year-old Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) student, died in hospital on November 8 after suffering a severe brain injury. His funeral will be held on Friday. died in hospital on November 8 The student was reported to have fallen from the third floor to the second floor of a car park in Tseung Kwan O on November 4, near the site of a protest and police clearance operation. On Thursday evening, Chow’s family held a public Christian service at Po Fook Memorial Hall in Tai Wai. Before nightfall, a long queue had formed outside the hall with people wanting to pay their respects to Chow. They included secondary school pupils, university students, workers and some dressed all in black and wearing masks. Although the service was scheduled to end at 8pm, the doors were kept open because of the large turnout.  A black-clad man in his 20s, who did not want to be named, said he had been active in the ongoing anti-government protests, and that he wanted to pay respect to Chow and others he believed had lost their lives during the movement. anti-government protests   “The investigation must go on, regardless of what the truth is [about Chow’s death],” he said. A 45-year-old housewife, surnamed Ng, brought white flowers to the hall.    Kelvin Leung Ming-hin, vice-president of the university’s student union, said he hoped people would not forget about Chow and the circumstances surrounding his death. Leung also said he hoped Chow’s family could eventually recover from the loss. There were dozens of wreaths from family, friends and HKUST staff and alumni, as well as from local politicians including Civic Party leader Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu. IPCC rejected experts’ request to comment on Hong Kong protest report 12 Dec 2019 IPCC rejected experts’ request to comment on Hong Kong protest report 12 Dec 2019 Inside the hall, attendants laid white flowers in front of Chow’s portrait, as a video slide show of the young man’s photos was played on a screen. The video showed Chow as a child, young student and sportsman. HKUST president Wei Shyy, dean of engineering Tim Cheng Kwang-ting and school council chairman Andrew Liao Cheung-sing attended the service but did not speak to the media, and neither did Chow’s family. Cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun and singer Denise Ho Wan-sze, a pro-democracy activist, were also there. Memorials in Hong Kong for death of student, Chow Tsz-lok Memorials in Hong Kong for death of student, Chow Tsz-lok The exact circumstances of Chow’s fall remain unclear, but many blame police, who were at the time conducting clearance operations nearby against protesters trying to disrupt an officer’s wedding. Some also alleged police delayed medical help for Chow, who was only put into an ambulance about 30 minutes after he was found. The force said no officers entered the car park in that time. Chow’s death sparked both peaceful and violent protests involving clashes with police. Link Reit, which runs the car park, released security camera footage from inside the facility, but the clips did not capture the fall. Meanwhile, thousands of people gathered at Edinburgh Place in Central on Thursday night to commemorate the six-month anniversary of the protest on June 12, when police fired tear gas against protesters who tried stop the legislature from debating the controversial extradition bill. That legislation, since withdrawn, sparked the protests which have grown over the past six months into a wider anti-government movement. The organiser estimated 43,000 people joined the rally, while police said turnout peaked at 5,800. The protesters observed a minute of silence for Chow, and reiterated the five demands that they said the government should address, including setting up an independent inquiry into the police force’s response to the unrest. Some protesters set up roadblocks on nearby Lung Wo Road at about 9.30pm, but were soon removed by rally marshals and police. The rally ended peacefully at about 10pm. 	SCMP

The incident came just hours after police arrested a 29-year-old man, and two teenagers, a boy and a girl, in separate incidents involving KMB buses in Kowloon. The MTR Corporation said black-clad “rioters” hurled petrol bombs at two escalators and a Maxim’s Cakes shop at Ngau Tau Kok MTR station in Kowloon at around 1am. They also vandalised ticket machines and other facilities on the concourse. “An immediate evacuation and closure were needed at Ngau Tak Kok station,” the MTR Corporation wrote in a statement. “The MTR Corporation expresses strong anger that its rail station has once again been targeted by the attack and malicious vandalism. It strongly condemns these illegal acts.”  The suspects fled before police arrived, no one was injured, and rail services resumed as normal this morning. On Wednesday evening, police arrested a 16-year-old boy at 8.14pm on suspicion of pressing the emergency buttons on four KMB buses, forcing them to pull over at the junction of Nathan Road and Argyle Street in Mong Kok. Officers found a pair of gloves and a hammer on the teenager, who was also arrested on suspicion of possessing an instrument fit for unlawful purpose.  The boy suffered head injuries during the arrest and a police officer suffered minor hand injuries while subduing the suspect. They were taken to hospital for treatment.  Later, a 15-year-old girl and three black-clad men intercepted a KMB vehicle, pressed its emergency button and broke its window in Nathan Road, near the junction with Waterloo Road in Yau Ma Tei. Officers arrested the girl who fell over trying to escape, her accomplices got away. According to police, a 29-year-old man tried to stop officers arresting the girl, and after verbal warnings were ignored, police pepper-sprayed the man and arrested him as well. More than 8,000 petrol bombs primed for Hong Kong streets ‘found in weapons factory at Chinese University’ 19 Nov 2019 More than 8,000 petrol bombs primed for Hong Kong streets ‘found in weapons factory at Chinese University’ 19 Nov 2019 The last petrol bomb attack on the city’s rail network was on December 1 in Whampoa, when protests turned ugly after thousands marched from Tsim Sha Tsui harbourfront to Hung Hom. Since the pro-democracy camp gained a landslide victory in district councils last month, there have been fewer clashes between protesters and police, and vandalism of railway facilities has also been reduced. But businesses thought to have links with the mainland, like Maxim’s, are still not spared from being attacked. The rail operator emerged as a key target for radicals in August, two months after the anti-government protests broke out, after they accused it of bowing to pressure from Beijing following a scathing attack by mainland media, which said the company facilitated the actions of mobs by laying on extra trains during protests. Missing chemicals from universities spark fears over public safety 19 Nov 2019 Missing chemicals from universities spark fears over public safety 19 Nov 2019 Since then MTR Corp has taken a tougher stance against protesters by obtaining a court injunction to prevent disruptive acts on its network, and closing stations ahead of planned protests, but it has denied bowing to pressure from Beijing. As of November 24, radicals had caused extensive damage to 85 of 94 MTR stations, and 62 of 68 Light Rail stops. Affected facilities include turnstiles, ticketing machines, surveillance cameras, lifts and escalators and rolling shutters. Last week, the rail giant said it would incur HK$1.6 billion in costs because of lower revenue from train services, repair costs for damaged facilities, extra expenses for bolstering security, and concessions to its retail tenants. As a result, the corporation warned of a significant decline in profits in the financial year ending December 31 from last year. 	SCMP

The separate submissions from the Hong Kong Senior Government Officers Association, Government Employees Association, and Model Scale 1 Staff Consultative Council (Staff Side), came a day ahead of the legislature’s Finance Committee meeting, which was set to scrutinise the funding application for the pay rise concerning more than 176,000 civil servants. The development was prompted by a joint letter from pro-democracy lawmakers and almost 400 newly elected district councillors from the same camp on Monday, where they asked the government to remove police from the funding request. They argued there must be a separate discussion on pay rises for police, with the force coming come under fire for its handling of anti-government protests since June. The Hong Kong Senior Government Officers Association said the pay rise mechanism hinged on six factors, including the economy, the government’s financial situation and public servants’ morale. “It does not include any consideration over the performance of individual departments or staff,” it wrote. The association appealed to lawmakers to respect the existing mechanism, which had been recognised by both the unions and the government for years.  The Government Employees Association, which has close ties with the Beijing-friendly Federation of Trade Unions, said the pay rise should not be politicised and members of the public should express their discontent towards civil servants through established channels. “Police officers are part of the civil service. We do not agree with the suggestion to hive off their pay rise from the funding request,” it wrote. “There is no precedent for that.”  The Model Scale 1 Staff Consultative Council (Staff Side), which represents junior staff, said the funding application for pay increments had already been postponed for months.  The item was originally expected to be scrutinised before the Legislative Council’s summer recess, but it was forced to close early after protesters stormed and vandalised the building on July 1. Thomas So Chau-ming, chairman (staff side) of the Disciplined Services Consultative Council, said the pan-democrats’ suggestion was unfair. “There is no mechanism to single out a force or a department when it comes to public servants’ annual pay rise,” said So, who is a Government Flying Services representative on the council. “This time the politicians are not happy with police. What if next time they are not satisfied with the service of the Immigration Department or others?” But Democratic Party leader Wu Chi-wai argued police had been dragging down the city’s governance and that the civil service unions’ attitude was not helpful in easing the deadlock. “By bundling the funding request, the government is actually hijacking the welfare of all civil servants who deserve the pay rises,” he said. “Handling the pay increments for police and the rest of the civil servants separately is actually the most desirable way to solve the problem.” Five Civic Party lawmakers on Thursday also wrote to Finance Committee chairman Chan Kin-por, urging him to invite Commissioner of Police Chris Tang Ping-keung to attend the meeting and directly address questions from legislators regarding the funding requests concerning the force. In June, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and her Executive Council decided to give senior civil servants pay increments of 4.75 per cent, and rises of 5.26 per cent for those in the lower and middle salary bands. Human rights group and pan-democrats have criticised police for their heavy-handed approach towards protesters in increasingly violent confrontations. Since June, more than 16,000 rounds of tear gas, 10,000 rubber bullets, 2,000 beanbag rounds and 1,850 sponge grenades have been fired at protesters, who have thrown petrol bombs and bricks at police, and targeted them with bows and arrows.

Unionists and campaigners took to the stage in Edinburgh Place, Central, to encourage Hongkongers to set up new unions to turn the screws on a government already squeezed by the protests sparked six months ago by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. The organisers said 1,800 people attended the rally at its peak, but police put the figure at 550. A spokesman for the rally’s organiser and a public hospital nurse, Law Cheuk-yiu, said: “If we unite, we will get stronger. When we have strength, our actions will have impacts and our voices will be heard. And we can resist the political suppression [by the government] more forcibly. “We hope to be able to set up unions for different disciplines in the sector, so we can plan our future actions, including possible strikes.” He said those who joined the rally mainly included employees of public hospitals, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and those working in the field of medicine and medical devices.  They criticised police for using “excessive force” in handling protests over the past few months, citing examples of firing tear gas near hospitals. “It will affect the patients. But the Hospital Authority did not make any noise about that, while it asked medical staff not to hold any rallies at hospitals to ensure patient services were not affected,” said Law.  Carol Ng Man-yee, a veteran unionist and the chairman of the pro-democracy Confederation of Trade Unions, said the previous calls for general strikes were “not too successful” because there were not enough unions to mobilise workers from various trades. Hundreds of thousands joined Hong Kong’s first march approved by police since August Hundreds of thousands joined Hong Kong’s first march approved by police since August “The more unions we set up, more trades will be covered and represented. Then our resistance can be more sustainable,” she said.  One of the new unions formed on Wednesday was from the pharmaceutical and medical device industries sector. One of the organisers, Tsang, 27, said the months-long unrest had prompted him to register with a union. “There had been calls for general strikes since June. But many feared of retributions and consequences. Therefore we hope those from our sector will find a channel to voice our opinion and fight for our rights and benefits by forming a union,” he said.

In Admiralty, about 100 separatists led a rally outside the British Consulate to call on London to “annul” the treaty it signed with Beijing in 1984, resulting in Hong Kong’s handover to China, and help the city build an independent democracy. The activists, from the Hong Kong Independence Party, claimed London no longer had any obligation to honour the Sino-British Joint Declaration because Beijing had “breached it in the first place by failing to adhere to the ‘one country, two systems’ principle”. They cited the example of a Causeway Bay bookseller who was taken to mainland China without going through any process under Hong Kong law. Thousands of Hong Kong medical workers and supporters hold anti-police rally 27 Oct 2019 Thousands of Hong Kong medical workers and supporters hold anti-police rally 27 Oct 2019 Ma, 24, a marketing sector employee who was among the participants, admitted the chances for the activists to succeed in their appeal were slim. “But that doesn’t mean it is impossible,” she said, adding that she hoped “genuine autonomy” and universal suffrage could be achieved in the long run. The 1984 treaty paved the way for Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule in 1997 in an arrangement under the “one country, two systems” principle. But the anti-government protests of recent months have sparked concern that the firewall between the two systems is being eroded. London is of the view that the agreement remains in effect and is legally binding, which must be honoured. But Chinese officials have referred to it as an “historic document” that had “completed its mission”. The activists said a representative of the consulate received their petition before the rally started at 8pm. 	SCMP

While not referring directly to the US, the comments by Chinese vice foreign minister Ma Zhaoxu at a human rights forum in Beijing on Wednesday followed advances in the US legislative process for bills on Hong Kong and Xinjiang. Hong Kong Xinjiang “Some countries are making colour revolutions all over the place to force regime change under the banner of human rights,” Ma said, referring to various protest movements in former Soviet bloc countries in the early 2000s. “This has led to conflicts and instability, and one humanitarian crisis after another. This is an important source of chaos in the world today.” Uygur woman describes torture in China’s Xinjiang ‘vocational training’ camps Uygur woman describes torture in China’s Xinjiang ‘vocational training’ camps China has accused the US of fomenting months of mass anti-government demonstrations in Hong Kong, refusing to recognise protesters’ demands for direct elections for the city’s leader and legislature. Beijing has also been angered by two pieces of US legislation, which it said amounted to interference in its domestic affairs.  Earlier this month, the US House of Representatives passed a bill condemning the mass detentions of an estimated million or so Uygurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. passed a bill condemning the mass detentions The bill proposes sanctions against Chinese government officials deemed responsible for human rights abuses in the far western region.

Ma also indirectly attacked US trade policy at the China-sponsored South-South Human Rights Forum in Beijing on Wednesday, saying that a trade war that has engulfed the two countries for more than a year was triggered by “self-interest”. “Some nations are wielding ‘sanctions batons’ recklessly and stepping up economic blockades, moving to decouple science and technology and impose financial sanctions against target nations,” he said. “These acts not only hinder the development of the world economy, but also violate the human rights of the people of the affected countries. They must be firmly opposed and resisted.”   Communist Party propaganda chief Huang Kunming also addressed the forum, repeating China’s rejection of the idea of a universal human rights standard. China insists it is up to each nation to choose its own path when it comes to human rights, and dismisses Western concepts of free speech, liberal democracy and civil rights in favour of tough authoritarian control aimed at growing the economy and raising living standards. “There is no universal human rights path and model in the world,” Huang said. “The development of the cause of human rights must and can only be promoted in accordance with the national conditions of each country and the needs of the people.” Additional reporting by Associated Press Additional reporting by Associated Press 	SCMP

Lawrence Ho Ka-ki, assistant professor of social sciences at Education University, said the decision of the five overseas experts, who came from major western democracies and common law jurisdictions, dealt a serious blow to Hong Kong’s international image. “The IPCC model may be useful for looking into the conduct of individual police officers. But it doesn’t work when it comes to large-scale and citywide actions of the force,” Ho, an expert on policing in Hong Kong, said. “Most members of the IPCC are amateurs who do not have expertise to monitor police conduct,” Ho said. “Among the experts invited to take part in the probe were Denis O’Connor, the former British chief inspector of constabulary, and Justice Colin Doherty, the head of New Zealand’s police watchdog.  “The council does not even have the statutory powers for fact-finding and investigation,” Ho said. The police watchdog’s remit presently allows it to only review complaints against officers passed on by the force’s complaints division, but it does not have the power to launch its own investigation or subpoena any documents or witnesses. Ho said a commission of inquiry with statutory powers was the best way to address public concerns over alleged police brutality. Overseas experts advising police watchdog on protests quit their jobs 11 Dec 2019 Overseas experts advising police watchdog on protests quit their jobs 11 Dec 2019 Civil Rights Observer member Icarus Wong Ho-yin said the overseas experts’ decision indicated that the IPCC’s approach had failed to deliver a credible probe into the allegations of excessive use of force by police while handling protests in recent months.  “IPCC chairman Anthony Neoh should tender resignation immediately and the government should set up a commission of inquiry with full investigatory powers,” he said.  Several opinion polls indicate that most Hongkongers support an independent inquiry, but Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has insisted on leaving all questions over police conduct to the IPCC. The government said in a statement on Wednesday it would study all the IPCC recommendations before deciding the next course of action. Two weeks ago, the embattled leader said the government was in the process of setting up an independent review committee that would look into the causes of the crisis. But former transport and housing minister Anthony Cheung Bing-leung said the review committee was unlikely to satisfy those demanding an independent probe into police actions. Nothing independent about Hong Kong police complaints process, say critics 28 Jun 2019 Nothing independent about Hong Kong police complaints process, say critics 28 Jun 2019 Dr Edmund Cheng Wai, a political scientist from City University, said the latest developments had offered the government an opportunity to back down. “It has proven the current mechanism does not work,” he said. Cheng said any sensible government would now empower the proposed review committee, granting it the power to summon witnesses, and widening its scope to look into not only the current issues but also the deep-seated problems in the city. Hospital Authority chairman Henry Fan Hung-ling last week said the review committee should be granted statutory powers to call witnesses to help its investigation, which would otherwise invariably cover police operations. last week said IPCC does not have powers and resources to cope with scale of protests 11 Nov 2019 IPCC does not have powers and resources to cope with scale of protests 11 Nov 2019 Priscilla Leung Mei-fun, a pro-establishment lawmaker and a member of the Basic Law Committee which advises Beijing on the city’s mini-constitution, said any review should not only pinpoint police, and floated a new middle-ground proposal on the powers of the review committee. She suggested limiting the power of subpoena to part of the review of the causes of the social unrest, instead of the whole review that would touch on deep-seated issues. “The committee is not exactly a commission of inquiry, but it does enjoy part of the power of summons. That may be the best way to find a middle ground to solve the problem,” Leung said. She described it as a golden opportunity to solve the problem, noting there was relatively less violence over the last week. “I urge the government to grant more power to the review committee to soothe the situation,” Leung said.

The revelation came after education minister Kevin Yeung Yun-hung said schools must take immediate steps to ensure teachers arrested in relation to the anti-government unrest did not pose a threat to pupils. Yeung urged principals to assess whether it was safe for academic staff accused of disorder-related offences to continue in their roles, after the teacher and six students were arrested on suspicion of weapons possession. They were among 12 people held in the early hours of Monday in connection with the carrying of objects in Sheung Shui that police said included flammable liquid, metal nails and an electric drill. Following those arrests, Tse Ming-kee, a 31-year-old teacher at a school for children with learning difficulties, appeared at Fanling Court on Wednesday charged with one count of possessing an instrument fit for unlawful purposes. Teachers come under attack as more students join Hong Kong protests 14 Oct 2019 Teachers come under attack as more students join Hong Kong protests 14 Oct 2019 He was said to have been carrying two pairs of scissors, two pairs of pliers and a spanner at a car park in Tin Ping Estate in Sheung Shui early on Monday.  Construction worker Ho Kwok-kay, 39, as well as students Chan Ka-wai, 17, and Lam Hiu-lok, 18, faced a similar charge for allegedly possessing three cans of naphtha, 37 plastic tubes affixed with iron nails, 24 bottles of Chinese wine, and two boxes of unused tubes and nails. The charge under the Summary Offences Ordinance is punishable by either a fine of HK$5,000 (US$640) or two years in prison.  Speaking after opening the 10th Learning and Teaching Expo 2019 in Wan Chai, Yeung said the Education Bureau was prepared to bar teachers from the profession if protest-linked misconduct revealed through its own complaints system was deemed serious.  In response to the arrests, the secretary for education said: “Any teachers who have been arrested should declare it to the school, and the school as an employer should consider if the teachers are still suitable for work.”   The main considerations for management included the effect on the school and students, and whether the teacher posed any danger to the institution, Yueng said. He said the point was not to punish teachers but to ensure the smooth running of the school and the safety of students. The Education Bureau said on Tuesday night that it would ask the employer of the teacher arrested in Sheung Shui to consider suspending the member of staff. Teacher among four arrested in public hospitals after clashes 14 Jun 2019 Teacher among four arrested in public hospitals after clashes 14 Jun 2019 Hong Chi Association, which runs Hong Chi Morninglight School in Tuen Mun, where the arrested teacher works, said it was concerned about the incident. “Providing students with a happy learning environment to let them grow healthily remains the school’s top priority,” it said in a statement. The association refused to comment further, citing ongoing legal proceedings. Hundreds of thousands joined Hong Kong’s first march approved by police since August Hundreds of thousands joined Hong Kong’s first march approved by police since August The Education Bureau said on Wednesday evening it understood the teacher concerned had been suspended, adding it would maintain close contact with the school. While education sector lawmaker Ip Kin-yuen said school managers must uphold the principle that people were innocent until proven guilty when dealing with cases of arrested teachers, the bureau said the suspension did not assume wrongdoing. Ip called on the school to ensure the teacher was able to appeal, while having access to legal help and union assistance. School says it will not interfere in teacher’s political views 13 Sep 2019 School says it will not interfere in teacher’s political views 13 Sep 2019 Yeung’s comments came after Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor called on the bureau to “seriously follow up” on those teachers arrested in relation to anti-government protests, which have taken hold of the city for six months. She said “violence entering schools” posed safety concerns for schools, parents and students. Lam also called on schools to stop students from taking part in unlawful protests and to warn them to keep away from scenes of violence. From June to November, the Education Bureau said it had received 106 misconduct complaints relating to teachers and the protests. It had already processed 60 cases, of which 30 were found to involve wrongdoing. On how the complaints would be handled, Yeung said: “We will look into the background of the cases to see if the teachers have been involved in misconduct to decide how to take necessary disciplinary measures, which would include warnings, reprimands or even deregistration if the offences are serious.”   Meanwhile, a teacher from Tak Sun Secondary School in Sha Tin, faced a disciplinary hearing on Wednesday after audio leaked online appeared to capture him swearing at a student in class and calling protesters “roaches”. In the recording, the teacher also said: “They have been throwing petrol bombs for five months and still they miss the target. Why not throw better? The same as you guys - having studyied biology for five months and you still do not pay attention.” When a pupil apologised, the teacher made an obsence comment about the student's mother. The principal issued a statement on Wednesday admitting teacher's use of inappropriate language when dealing with student misbehaviour, adding the teacher had immediately apologised to the whole class. “The school does not agree with the wording and examples used by the teacher, as well as how the discipline issue was handled,” the statement said. “The school has immediately stopped the teacher from using any inappropriate language and making personal comments on sensitive social issues. We will conduct a disciplinary hearing and pass the result to the board.” Hong Kong has been gripped by more than six months of social unrest sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. Among the 6,022 people arrested since June 9, nearly 40 per cent, or 2,393, were students. At the hearings in Fanling Court on Wednesday, lawyers for Ho and Chan said their clients had been subject to violence when they were arrested by police. The remaining eight people arrested, including four other students, have been released on police bail. These four students and the two charged are not from Tse's school. Acting principal magistrate Don So Man-lung adjourned the case to February 5 to allow time for police to examine the flammable liquid and conduct DNA analysis. So granted Chan bail at HK$5,000 cash plus a surety at the same amount. The remaining three were each allowed bail at HK$10,000. All four must obey a travel ban and a curfew.

Diplomatic and political pundits believe the heightened activism among Chinese envoys underlines an overriding priority to prevent further internationalisation of what Beijing insists is an internal issue, in the wake of Washington’s support for the city’s anti-government protesters. Already buffeted by a prolonged trade war, China’s relations with the United States deteriorated further when President Donald Trump last month signed into law the Hong Kong Democracy and Human Rights Act, which American lawmakers passed almost unanimously. Hong Kong Democracy and Human Rights Act Rally in Hong Kong to thank US for supporting the Human Rights and Democracy Act Rally in Hong Kong to thank US for supporting the Human Rights and Democracy Act More alarmingly for Beijing, Hong Kong protesters have been campaigning for other countries to follow Washington’s lead and pass similar bills in support of their cause. In response, ambassadors in Europe – where a major shift is under way in relations with China – and other countries along the geopolitical fault line between Beijing and Washington, are speaking out as never before. On the defensive on human rights, China’s ambassadors go on the attack 7 Dec 2019 On the defensive on human rights, China’s ambassadors go on the attack 7 Dec 2019 Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his predecessor, Politburo member Yang Jiechi – who both serve on the Communist Party’s coordination group for Hong Kong and Macau affairs – have led the way in blasting what Beijing sees as foreign interference, as Australia, Canada and Europe have joined the US in voicing support for the Hong Kong protesters. Wang Yi Yang Jiechi  In Britain, China’s longest-serving ambassador Liu Xiaoming has been especially busy since the mass protests broke out in early June. Liu Xiaoming He was among the first batch of Chinese officials to comment after the initial rally – two days before any official statements were issued by Beijing’s top bodies overseeing the city, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the central government’s liaison office in Hong Kong. Apart from giving speeches and penning opinion pieces for newspapers around the world, Liu has so far hosted three press briefings specifically on Hong Kong and taken more than a dozen interviews from British, American and Chinese media outlets, according to his embassy’s website.  Liu’s messaging has been clear and consistent – unswerving support for the city’s embattled local government and police force and condemnation of foreign interference and the violence perpetrated by protesters.  His lead has been followed by Chinese envoys in other European countries, such as Italy, France, Spain, Poland, Finland and the Netherlands, who have also spoken out, sometimes repeatedly, on the issue. Ambassadors in Canada and Singapore, as well as dozens of others in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America have issued statements to local media, vigorously pushing Beijing’s official line on the demonstrations. China’s foreign ministry and its diplomats in recent months have become visibly active on Twitter, which is blocked in mainland China, with envoys to the US, Britain, Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Austria joining the service this year. Ambassador: China ‘has resolution and power’ to end Hong Kong unrest 19 Nov 2019 Ambassador: China ‘has resolution and power’ to end Hong Kong unrest 19 Nov 2019 They have also repeatedly grabbed headlines over their often assertive and sometimes aggressive remarks about their host countries’ stance on China-related issues. Writing last month in﻿The Australian Financial Review, China’s acting envoy to Canberra Wang Xining urged Australians to “think twice, think thrice” before commenting on the disturbances in Hong Kong. The Australian Financial Review, The Chinese ambassador to the Czech Republic, Zhang Jianmin, lashed out at the “hypocrisy” of Western media and politicians, insisting there was no room for double standards on the issue.   David Zweig, emeritus professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said the involvement of the ambassadors “shows that this has become a foreign policy problem, and not just a domestic issue”. “The world is paying so much attention to Hong Kong, and the way China is handling it makes it look very poorly in the West. So, I guess the foreign ministry decided it needed to try and manage the fallout,” he said. Zhu Feng, an international affairs expert at Nanjing University, also said Washington’s adoption of the pro-protester legislation on Hong Kong had created a new fault line in bilateral ties and posed a dilemma for Beijing. “The mobilisation of the diplomatic establishment is clearly aimed at preventing the Hong Kong issue from internationalising and stopping other countries from following the US to take legislative measures on Hong Kong,” he said. Hundreds gather in Hong Kong to thank Trump for signing human rights act 1 Dec 2019 Hundreds gather in Hong Kong to thank Trump for signing human rights act 1 Dec 2019 Most analysts said the proactive stance on Hong Kong also reflected a broader shift in Chinese diplomacy in the era of President Xi Jinping. But, rather than signalling a rise in the diplomats’ influence on Communist Party decision-making, some observers point to a tendency to reflect only what Beijing wants to hear. Hundreds of thousands joined Hong Kong’s first march approved by police since August Hundreds of thousands joined Hong Kong’s first march approved by police since August “Domestically, China is steadily sliding in the direction of a more hardline, personalised authoritarian regime. Faced with this new reality, many bureaucrats – including China's diplomats – are increasingly performing for an audience of one,” said Carl Minzner, a veteran China watcher and professor of law at Fordham Law School in New York. “More and more, the information they channel to their superiors and their interactions with foreign officials are based on what they think Beijing wants to see, rather than reflecting either an objective evaluation of reality or China’s long-term national interests,” he said. In a speech at the Central Party School in September, Xi called on officials to embrace a fighting spirit in the face of a “long-term struggle” against a variety of threats at home and abroad. Xi Jinping rallies China for long ‘struggles’ amid rising tensions with US 5 Sep 2019 Xi Jinping rallies China for long ‘struggles’ amid rising tensions with US 5 Sep 2019 Wang Yi was even more specific about the need for a stronger fighting spirit among Chinese diplomats. At an internal gathering last month, he said diplomats should rise to the challenge and vigorously defend Beijing’s policies when China was obviously under attack, according to Reuters.   Former Chinese ambassador to Britain Ma Zhengang said it was a positive sign that senior diplomats were allowed more freedom to voice their opinions on social media platforms. “We were overly cautious in the past and often refrained from speaking out when our voice should have been heard. The changes we are seeing are partly due to the importance the leadership has attached to public diplomacy, which should help promote better stories about China,” he said. But, Ma said, while senior diplomats enjoyed a certain degree of freedom their key messages were usually preapproved – and not all China’s envoys had sufficient training to know how to do the public relations side of their job properly. “Although they may speak in their own words, it is clear that they represent the Chinese government’s stance. And the fact that not all of the embassies are involved in this kind of campaign indicates that only a certain number of diplomatic missions are assigned to do the job,” he said. 	SCMP

Typhoon Mangkhut ongoing civil unrest Its deficit more than doubled to HK$557.3 million (US$72 million) in the year to June 30, from HK$236.5 million in the previous year, according to an annual report released on Wednesday. The results did not reflect the impact of the tourism slump since July, as anti-government protests keep visitors away and add to the economic woes brought by the lingering US-China trade war. US-China trade war During the financial year, revenue grew 2.9 per cent to HK$1.7 billion while the number of visitors to the park was slightly lower at 5.7 million, from 5.8 million previously. The park said a “notable” rise in repairs and maintenance expenses required after the damage inflicted on facilities by the typhoon – which struck in summer 2018 – helped lift operating costs by 14 per cent to HK$1.5 billion. “Ocean Park is facing fierce competition from the proliferation of theme parks in the region and an increasingly difficult market environment,” Leo Kung Lin-cheng, the park’s chairman, said.  “Despite cost pressures, it is mandatory for us to invest in new infrastructure and meticulously curated offerings to uplift the guest experience, and maintain the park’s attraction as an entertainment destination and a tourism hotspot.” He said the park would continue to reinvent itself by stepping up hospitality services, education and conservation programmes. Ticket prices at Hong Kong’s Ocean Park up nearly 4 per cent 31 May 2019 Ticket prices at Hong Kong’s Ocean Park up nearly 4 per cent 31 May 2019 The park had also faced challenges during the first half of this financial year. It revealed last week that the number of tour group visitors plunged 56 per cent, and individual visitors from mainland China and overseas slumped more than 60 per cent between July and October, compared with the same period last year. more than 60 per cent between July and October  Yiu Si-wing, who represents the tourism sector in the legislature, said that, regardless of external factors, the park needed an inside-out reinvention.  “Its positioning in the regional market needed a thorough upgrade even before the protests took place,” he said. “I am not talking about adding new features or enhancing programmes. It is about a sweeping change in its image, product offerings and positioning in the region.” Set up in the 1970s, the park faces rising competition from theme parks across the border, namely Chimelong Ocean Kingdom in Hengqin, Zhuhai, which positions itself as a Monte Carlo of the East. 44 people injured by huge wave at Chinese ‘tsunami pool’ 44 people injured by huge wave at Chinese ‘tsunami pool’ Ocean Park’s new HK$2.9 billion water park, known as Tai Shue Wan Water World, is scheduled to open next year, while completion of a Fullerton hotel and resort at the park is due in 2021.

The panellists expressed hope that the two superpowers could dial back their distrust and suspicion moving ahead but added that they weren’t expecting much immediate progress. “Now more than ever, it’s very important for China and the United States – as superpowers, really, in the world economically – to tamp down the kind of craziness that’s going on,” said Alice Young, founder of an advisory group bearing her name. “And I’m not sure that, right now, we’re going to be capable of that,” she added, speaking at China Conference USA: Competition or Cooperation?, sponsored by the South China Morning Post. South China Morning Post Among the key variables expected to shape the future are whether China’s economic growth rate remains at six per cent to seven per cent annually over for the next decade, or if it slips. “If it’s growing by three per cent at the end of the decade, that’s a different variable,” said Kurt Tong, partner with The Asia Group consultancy and former US consul general to Hong Kong and Macau.  Another important factor would be whether the US tilted toward isolationism or internationalism, he added. And a third is what direction Chinese governance takes – and in particular whether it remains in its current authoritarian mode or tacks toward greater liberalisation. “That pendulum in recent Chinese history has been up and down,” Tong said. Ex-US envoy: ‘threshold should be high’ to change Hong Kong’s special status 9 Aug 2019 Ex-US envoy: ‘threshold should be high’ to change Hong Kong’s special status 9 Aug 2019 Tong said the main point that many often missed in the protest crisis was that the people of Hong Kong had deep frustrations that had not been addressed and needed to be for some semblance of calm to be restored.  “Both the US and the mainland have a way of injecting their own views on Hong Kong,” said Tong, who was based in the territory until June, shortly before the protests began.   Hong Kong had been hugely successful in large part because of its industrious and talented residents, he added. “If everyone could just focus on what the Hong Kong people are aspiring to and figure out a way to address that, so their anxiety level goes down, then we could see that Hong Kong’s success could continue for decades to come,” Tong said. US-China trade deal in “final throes”, says Trump but we’re watching Hong Kong US-China trade deal in “final throes”, says Trump but we’re watching Hong Kong Turning to the US-China trade agreement, panellists said they did not expect the Trump administration to follow through on its threat to apply another 15 per cent in tariffs to an additional US$156 billion in Chinese imports, an increase scheduled to take effect on Sunday. Given the current environment – with the administration in the middle of an impeachment fight, the holidays approaching and an election year coming up – neither side had much appetite for deepening the impasse, Young said. Technology would remain a key area of division between the two giants, panellists said, with some meeting of the minds possible on intellectual property rights, where China’s self-interest aligned broadly with Western demands. That is considered a more likely area for compromise than the issue of forced technology transfer, since Beijing does not even acknowledge that it applies such pressure on foreign companies. US-China rivalry will hurt 5G roll-out and innovation, experts say 12 Dec 2019 US-China rivalry will hurt 5G roll-out and innovation, experts say 12 Dec 2019 In the end, reduced cooperation in the fast-growing technology ecosystem is likely to dent innovation, hurt both countries and undercut the global economy. “In the old days, we’d say, if the United States sneezed, Japan would catch a cold. I think now, if China and the US sneeze, the world catches pneumonia,” said Young, adding: “Both countries are going to lose out.” Wang Xiangwei, columnist and former Post editor-in-chief, added that China was not out to challenge Washington directly but to ensure that its regional influence was commensurate with its rising economic power. Post “Of course China has its own strategic purpose, everyone does,” he said. “But I don’t think China has that intention at all to take on the US. China just wants to show the world it has its own sphere of influence.” 	SCMP

Neoh and his deputy, pro-establishment lawmaker Tony Tse Wai-chuen, sought to play down the implications of the experts’ decision on Wednesday, insisting they were not quitting – only “standing aside” after finishing their work, and could be involved again later. “I don’t think it is a resignation ... The first stage of our work has been collecting the facts. They came here twice and both meetings were useful,” Neoh said. Tse added: “Round one of their work has come to an end, that’s what they meant by ‘stand aside’. We hope they will be in close contact afterwards.” Resignations from police watchdog’s protests review ‘reveal system flaws’ 11 Dec 2019 Resignations from police watchdog’s protests review ‘reveal system flaws’ 11 Dec 2019 But commentators were quick to conclude that the experts had effectively resigned, as they were originally tasked to participate in all three rounds of the IPCC’s review – fact-finding, assessment and recommendations, of which the findings of the first part have yet to be released.  Opposition pan-democratic lawmakers likened it to a vote of no-confidence in any report the IPCC might come up with. They, along with pro-democracy groups such as the Civil Human Rights Front, urged embattled Hong Kong leader Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to set up an official commission of inquiry. Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor Hundreds of thousands joined Hong Kong’s first march approved by police since August Hundreds of thousands joined Hong Kong’s first march approved by police since August “Don’t waste our time, please ... grab this golden opportunity to persuade Beijing, or any person, to support an independent commission of inquiry (COI),” said Tanya Chan, convenor of the pro-democracy legislators. Last month, Lam sought to allay simmering discontent by revealing that she was setting up an independent review committee as well to investigate the underlying causes of the protests.  Pro-establishment lawmakers Priscilla Leung Mei-fun and Eunice Yung Hoi-yan called for the review committee to be given more investigative powers, now that the international experts were standing aside.  Without addressing the experts’ absence, a government spokesman would only say the study results would be closely watched and recommendations carefully examined before deciding on any follow-up actions. Asked in Beijing to comment on the experts’ departure, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying reiterated that Hong Kong police had been restrained and professional in handling protests. “It is a big lie to say that the police in Hong Kong had abused or used excessive force,” she said. The IPCC report is expected to be submitted to Lam by the end of December, and to be published in late January at the earliest. Sources previously told the Post that officials would consider setting up the commission of inquiry – a core demand of the protest movement – if the public was dissatisfied with the police watchdog’s report. Post In a statement on Wednesday, the experts said despite their calls for more investigatory powers, “dialogue with the IPCC has not led to any agreed process through which the [panel] would be able to effectively support the Thematic Study [of several key protest dates] any further at this stage”. “As a result, the [panel] has taken the decision to formally stand aside from its role,” they said.   They reiterated their proposal was made with the aim of starting the process of getting the IPCC to “begin to meet the standards” that Hong Kong citizens would need of a police watchdog that would honour their rights and freedoms. “While we assessed that meaningful progress had been made in data collection and analysis, we ultimately concluded that a crucial shortfall was evident in the powers, capacity and independent investigative capability of IPCC,” the panel said. The panel, which was supposed to be involved in the watchdog’s ongoing review beyond its first report due in late January at the earliest, said it remained committed to engaging with the IPCC – “if and when it develops the necessary capabilities and provides its draft interim report on the protests”. Among the experts invited to take part were Denis O’Connor, a former British chief inspector of constabulary, and Justice Colin Doherty, head of New Zealand’s police watchdog. The watchdog’s governing council said it deeply appreciated the panel’s participation and contribution, and stressed its advice would be considered “thoroughly” in the review process. “The IPCC is pleased that [panel] members desire to remain engaged. After publishing the first interim report, depending on the development of events and needs, the IPCC will review the way forward and liaise with the [panel] members on appropriate arrangements going forward,” it said in a statement on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Lam was apologetic as she met members of the pro-establishment New People’s Party on Wednesday afternoon, after the landslide loss of the bloc in November’s district council elections. landslide loss district council elections Chairwoman Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, an adviser to Lam in the Executive Council, rejected the chief executive’s apology. “Lam just said the phrase ‘I apologise’ in her opening remarks, which was not that sincere. Some members told her in the face that her apology was not accepted,” Ip said. “We did not lose because of our performance, but because of the government and politics ... We hope the chief executive will not just talk, but improve governance and benefit Hong Kong with concrete actions.” Additional reporting by Kimmy Chung and Jeffie Lam Additional reporting by Kimmy Chung and Jeffie Lam 	SCMP

But analysts said apart from the public greetings and messages and body language, it is the key instructions behind closed doors that will decide whether Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s government will change its course and in what direction. Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s They believe China’s top leaders, including Xi, Premier Li Keqiang, and Vice-Premier Han Zheng, could make use of the opportunity to brief Lam on issues ranging from protecting national security, rebuilding ties with the pro-establishment camp, to imposing sanctions on American organisations. Sources told the Post that Lam was expected to fly to Beijing on Saturday, meet Xi and Li on December 16, and return to Hong Kong the day after. Post The meetings will be the first after Hong Kong’s pro-establishment bloc suffered a humiliating, landslide defeat at the district council elections, with the pro-democracy camp winning 392 out of 452 seats on November 24, taking control of 17 of the 18 district councils. district council elections Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of The Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said even though Xi and Han had met Lam on November 4 and 6 respectively, the duty visit was not just about more meetings with China’s top politicians.  “It is the annual occasion when the chief executive submits her report to state leaders, and then they will evaluate her work in the past and look forward to the year ahead,” he said. After a four-day plenary meeting in October, Communist Party leaders issued a communique that devoted considerable attention to Hong Kong. It said Beijing would strengthen supervision of the city’s affairs, and “establish a sound legal system and enforcement mechanism for safeguarding national security” in Hong Kong and Macau.  Lau believes Xi and Li will tell Lam what the central government’s plans are, especially in terms of national security, and what they expect her to do.  “They are also likely to urge Lam to do more to stop violence and end chaos in Hong Kong,” he said. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam sought Xi Jinping’s approval to formally withdraw extradition bill that triggered anti-government protests Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam sought Xi Jinping’s approval to formally withdraw extradition bill that triggered anti-government protests Meeting Lam in Shanghai on November 4, Xi said he trusted the chief executive, quashing speculation she could be replaced, even as he signalled her government must quell the five months of social unrest. social unrest. Two days later, in a meeting with the chief executive in Beijing, Han, the top leader overseeing Hong Kong affairs, also acknowledged Lam’s work. But he also made it clear that ending the turmoil was the responsibility of the entire administration – the executive, legislature and the judiciary. But after nearly two weeks of relative calm, chaos returned on December 1, as a group of protesters hurled bricks and police fired tear gas, while radicals set about smashing shops after a peaceful march. Song Sio-chong, professor of the Centre for Basic Laws of Hong Kong and Macau at Shenzhen University, said with the return of violence, it seemed there was little for Lam to report to Xi. “When the president met her in November, the instruction was clear. She needs to stop the violence, have wide-ranging dialogue with Hong Kong people and improve people’s lives,” Song said. “To have dialogue with society means you will have to unite friends, soften foes and win over the middle ground. What she did so far is very limited and ineffective.” Bruce Lui Ping-kuen, a China watcher and senior lecturer in journalism at Baptist University, warned that with pro-Beijing politicians’ unprecedented loss at the polls, and increasingly apparent grievances against Lam, it was possible state leaders could discuss with the chief executive plans to replace her. “Beijing could consider whether Lam is now a negative asset, and would undermine the pro-Beijing camp’s chances at the Legislative Council polls in September,” Lui said. “Lam could be given some tasks, to protect national security and end protests with judicial means, and then the central government would deal with the city’s leadership pragmatically.” It is unlikely that Xi will publicly rebuke someone he picked as the chief executive Bruce Lui, senior lecturer in journalism at Baptist University In December 2004, less than three months before the city’s first post-colonial leader Tung Chee-hwa stepped down, he was ordered by President Hu Jintao to lift his administration’s game. In strong remarks seen by many observers as a dressing down of the city leader, Hu also called on the Tung team to improve governance by identifying the inadequacies of its rule. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam reveals apology to defeated pro-Beijing candidates after district council elections 10 Dec 2019 Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam reveals apology to defeated pro-Beijing candidates after district council elections 10 Dec 2019 In sharp contrast, in November 2014, Xi cited a line from an ancient poem – “strong winds reveal the strength of sturdy grass” – as praise for then chief executive Leung Chun-ying’s loyalty and resilience. That was the first meeting between Leung and Xi since the 79-day Occupy protests erupted in September. Lui said while it remained unclear whether Xi would have any public word of praise for Lam, it was almost certain the city leader would not get a dressing down from the president. “It is unlikely that Xi will publicly rebuke someone he picked as the chief executive,” he said. Lau went a step further by saying it remained unthinkable for Lam to be rebuked or replaced when there were bigger headaches for Xi to deal with. “As there are disturbances in Hong Kong, China and the US are fighting each other, and China’s national security has been seriously challenged, no Chinese leader would want to create more factors of uncertainty,” he said. “Hong Kong’s pro-establishment camp need to unite, and become an effective intermediary between the government and the people, and the city’s government also needs stability. Compared to these, replacing the chief executive is only a small issue with a lower priority.” 	SCMP

After presenting their staff cards or authorisation document, those who worked in cleared areas were let in to Polytechnic University by recently hired security guards at three entrances. Many were eager to find out how the drama had affected their workplace. Some who were still worried about their safety wore surgical masks, multiple rounds of tear gas having been fired on the campus as radical protesters and police clashed during the mayhem. Occupiers were also accused of removing hazardous chemicals from labs. Campus cafe and restaurant operators joined those heading back, aiming to assess the damage after losing access to the site more than three weeks ago.

I am going in to see how the facilities and computers are faring,” Kwan said, before heading to block Y. A 28-year-old mainland Chinese doctoral student, surnamed Liu, said he had not been able to return to block Y, where he was conducting a project on organic chemistry. He expected his research had been affected by the events of recent weeks, although he was not sure to what extent. “I have to find out if things have been damaged first,” he said. A cafe supervisor, surnamed Chow, 43, went to inspect the W Kiosk in block W to see if any repairs were needed. But he expected damage to be limited as the kiosk was tucked away in a hidden spot. An employee surnamed Cheung, who was involved in the clean-up, said the work was almost done. The university said earlier that PolyU’s second term would begin as scheduled on January 13, although the first two weeks would be for holding exams that were supposed to have been taken in the first semester.

It said some samples had already been sent for testing. Results were expected to be released in the second half of December. Research assistant Eddie Lee, 23, from the health technology and informatics department, said the university should not have reopened until all the tests were run. “Many rounds of tear gas were fired and there could still be traces of them,” he said. Meanwhile, in response to a question at the Legislative Council concerning stolen dangerous chemicals, Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung said the universities concerned should reflect on how to improve campus management. “If the chemicals in the laboratories fall within the definition of dangerous goods, the universities … [should] ensure that the storage and use of dangerous goods on campus meet the requirements of the relevant ordinance,” he said, adding that the Education Bureau would help universities to boost security.

A filing in the High Court said pro-democracy contender Hung Chun-hin, the only other candidate in the race, had made false representations about Cheng’s political affiliation and his own contribution to the community in some 13,000 leaflets he distributed among voters during the campaign. The filing asked the city judges to overrule Hung’s winning bid, saying he had violated Section 26(1) of the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance by prejudicing his competitor’s election. Hung told the Post he did not worry about losing his seat over Cheng’s petition.

The 54th Hong Kong Brands and Products Expo in Causeway Bay has become the latest target of protesters who launched online calls for “visiting the fair together” until the event ends on December 31. But hundreds of shoppers, mostly elderly people and housewives, still turned up at the park with their trolleys when the expo began at 11am. Businesses reported fair consumer sentiment even though security was tightened. Holding packs of pork knuckles and ginger stew, retiree Simon Ng said though the protests had dampened his shopping sentiment in general, this event was an exception. He planned to spend not more than HK$2,000 (US$255) at the expo – a budget similar to last year. “I feared protesters would demonstrate here. So, I came early,” the 55-year-old said. “If anything happens, I will be able to leave quickly.”  Hong Kong has been engulfed by protests, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, for six months. Many events have been cancelled because of safety and security concerns. protests The expo pressed on, but the number of exhibitors shrank about 26 per cent from 435 in 2018 to 323 this year. To lure visitors, the entry fee was slashed from HK$12 last year to HK$8 this year. A shopper, surnamed Kwok, 64, also visited the fair early, citing worries of potential chaos later in the day.  But the fear of chaos did not sour her consumer appetite.In 30 minutes after the fair began, the airport employee said she bought bags of abalone and dried seafood worth more than HK$2,000. Last year, she only spent around HK$1,000. In 30 minutes after the fair began, the airport employee said she bought bags of abalone and dried seafood worth more than HK$2,000. Last year, she only spent around HK$1,000. The expo’s organiser, the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association of Hong Kong, said it was worried about the situation, but still chose not to ask police to station at the event.  He said he would not call police as long as he felt the association could manage the situation on its own. “There is no problem with [protesters] ‘visiting the fair together’. We welcome them to come to have a look,” the association’s vice-president Marvin Hsu said. “It’s an expo for all Hongkongers.”  This year, the organiser has stepped up security measures by doubling the number of security guards for the 22-day expo. All visitors will have to go through security checks at the entrance. Items that are not allowed on the premises include dangerous objects, promotional materials carrying political messages, and non-drinkable liquids. Some visitors, such as businessman Kenneth Choi, 67, felt troubled as security officers asked them to drink water from the bottles they were carrying to prove the liquids were just meant for drinking. Holding two mini-suitcases of abalone products worth nearly HK$2,000, Choi said: “I will complain about that.” Facing safety risks, Cheong Hing Store has been alert about its knife products. Its head of sales and marketing Peter Law Tak-him said he had put the goods at the centre of the booth. “Our staff are well trained to monitor the surroundings. If anything happens, we will try our best to hide the knives as soon as possible,” he said. Law admitted the footfall on Tuesday morning was less than last year’s, but he said consumers still had the appetite for shopping. He said he hoped his revenue would not drop more than 20 per cent, saying the fall in takings was partly due to the shortened opening day of the fair this year. The expo has been cut short this time to 22 days from 24 days last year. It will remain open from 11am to 8pm daily, closing two hours earlier than last year. On the last day on December 31, the fair will close at 6pm. Nelson Wong Sze-kin, executive director at wild mushroom trader Luen Kee Hoo Co., felt the footfall this year was similar to last year’s. But he still foresaw takings to drop about 10 to 20 per cent due to weakened consumer sentiment and a drop in tourist figures.

People would inevitably suspect that the DPP “only wants to exchange Hongkongers’ sacrifices for Taiwanese people’s votes”, he added. Tsai’s main opponent in the January 11 presidential election, Han Kuo-yu from the Kuomintang party which favours close ties with the mainland, wrote on his Facebook page on Tuesday that Tsai was using Hong Kong as a “tool” for votes. Speaking to reporters later in the day, Tsai said that Taiwan had always had a supportive attitude towards the people of Hong Kong taking to the streets to fight for democracy. What was happening in Hong Kong had also put the people of Taiwan on alert and made them think that the island’s freedom and democratic values has must be protected with even greater strength, she added.  “Therefore, when they watch and listen to all the politicians, they pay special attention to the views and determination of these politicians or candidates on these issues,” Tsai said.

105	https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3041493/patience-wearing-thin-foreign-firms-hong-kong-after-months	2019-12-11	Is patience wearing thin for foreign firms in Hong Kong after months of protests?	Some foreign companies in Hong Kong may be losing patience and have started to make contingency plans in case the political unrest deteriorates again, an international business leader has warned. While they have so far downplayed the impact of the city’s bleak economic prospects, the foreign business community is aware of the city’s potential challenge to retain talent, according to Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. Wuttke said he was “struck” by the optimism of foreign companies that conditions in Hong Kong would remain stable, adding that there were concerns for the retail and restaurant sectors after the months of unrest but other sectors, such as cars and machinery, had not moved out of the city. But, he said, many of these businesses might relocate if the worst of the violent disturbances that had plagued Hong Kong for the past six months flared up again. The protests began in June over a now-withdrawn extradition law that would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to mainland China. The demonstrations escalated into wider and prolonged anti-government unrest marked by violent clashes between radicals and police which have eased off since the district council elections in November. “If the situation gets tough again, [such as] demonstrations and tear gas, you have to relocate meetings to safer areas away from Central [area], that’s not good. And I guess that, most of these [firms], definitely big ones, are looking into contingencies. So, what if the situation gets worse, what if there is serious confrontation, do we move to Singapore, do we move to Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangdong?” he said.  Wuttke said he also expected Hong Kong to face growing competition from neighbouring regions to attract talent in the coming years. “The other thing I guess of what happens over the next two to three years, other regions – south China, Japan, Singapore and other places – will try to attract talent from Hong Kong, and Hong Kong is all about people, all about talent, all about a knowledge base,” he said.  Wuttke said Japan was actively recruiting top financial people from Hong Kong while some cities in the southern mainland province of Guangdong, such as Dongguan, were offering high income tax refunds, which could be a huge attraction for hi-tech companies to relocate there.  “This maybe will make people think about moving across the border,” he said. Hundreds of thousands joined Hong Kong’s first march approved by police since August Hundreds of thousands joined Hong Kong’s first march approved by police since August St John Moore, chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in China, said on Tuesday that violence was not a solution to the Hong Kong issue and called for a peaceful resolution. “The integrity of China in that regard is a cause of uncertainty and the uncertainty is a challenge, certainly last month, or six weeks, [which] shift from a protest of something into actual violent protest, that is something of great concern, and that needs to be called back and needs to return to some form of a more peaceful process to try to achieve something,” Moore said. Hong Kong, which has played a key role in attracting foreign capital to China, has so far been unaffected by the punitive tariffs imposed by the US in its trade war with China. But that could change, with the recent passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act which puts the city’s special customs status under a yearly review. The legislation also allows Washington to impose sanctions on officials deemed to have violated human rights in Hong Kong, infuriating Beijing which has accused the US of being a “black hand” behind the city’s unrest. China suspends US military visits to Hong Kong after Donald Trump signs democracy act China suspends US military visits to Hong Kong after Donald Trump signs democracy act Retaliatory measures have included the suspension of US Navy visits to the city and sanctions against a number of US human rights NGOs for their alleged support of the violent protests. Beijing has also warned the US to stop intervening in China’s internal affairs to avoid jeopardising bilateral cooperation in key sectors. Analysts said the tensions may have cast a shadow over the already slower-than-expected trade talks between Beijing and Washington and warned the US moves would only hurt the people of Hong Kong, which slipped into a technical recession in the third quarter as the economy shrank 3.2 per cent, dragged by the unrest and the US-China trade war. warned the US moves would only hurt the people of Hong Kong technical recession Global credit agency Fitch cut the city’s rating by one notch, to AA from AA+, and lowered its outlook from stable to negative in September, amid the persistent political stalemate. Moody’s followed suit, downgrading its outlook for Hong Kong’s sovereign rating from stable to negative, while keeping the city’s rating unchanged at Aa2. Fitch cut the city’s rating by one notch Moody’s followed suit Stephen Orlins, president of the National Committee on US-China Relations, told the South China Morning Post on Sunday in the southern Chinese city of Sanya, Hainan province, that Hong Kong’s economic downturn had yet to create a big impact on US businesses in the city, but he added that some operations had been affected. South China Morning Post “Things like the closure of the airport, the inability of their employees to take mass transport to work, demonstrations which affect their ability to work in Hong Kong, these will certainly cause American companies to think about their long term plans for Hong Kong,” he said. “And it’s a tragedy. What both sides need to do is to step back and ask what is really in the long-term interest of people in Hong Kong.” 	SCMP

Two Court of Appeal judges on Tuesday acknowledged “Hong Kong is in a state of public danger” and the government had presented a “reasonably arguable” appeal against a lower court ruling that the colonial-era emergency law, which empowered the ban, was unconstitutional when used in times of public danger. However, they were not convinced the ban, introduced to tackle months of often-violent anti-government protests, was necessary to handle the law and order situation in the short term until the appeal was dealt with, and so rejected the administration’s application for exceptional measures to temporarily reinstate the ban or suspend the lower court declaration. But acting chief judge of the High Court Jeremy Poon Shiu-chor, who penned the joint ruling with Court of Appeal vice-president Johnson Lam Man-hon, warned their decision “is not and should not be regarded as an encouragement or condonation for any person to cover their face” in situations previously covered by the ban. Protesters gather to mark one month since mask ban was introduced Protesters gather to mark one month since mask ban was introduced “We have in no way determined the appeals one way or the other,” Poon wrote. “If one is to continue to wear masks ... in the meantime, he has to face the inherent risk of having acted contrary to the law should the [government] later succeed on appeal.” The Court of First Instance on November 18 ruled in favour of 25 opposition politicians to allow two judicial reviews challenging the Emergency Regulations Ordinance and its derivative, the Prohibition on Face Covering, introduced in October.  Justices Anderson Chow Ka-ming and Godfrey Lam Wan-ho on November 22 declared the ordinance incompatible with the Basic Law, the city's mini-constitution, when invoked in times of public danger, such as the present case. The judges also declared the mask ban made pursuant to the ordinance “invalid and of no effect”. Court suspends for seven days ruling that mask ban is unconstitutional 23 Nov 2019 Court suspends for seven days ruling that mask ban is unconstitutional 23 Nov 2019 But such declarations were immediately suspended as the court understood the government was expected to appeal.   The government also demanded a temporary validity order that would allow the relevant laws to remain valid and legal effective, or alternatively a temporary suspension order to postpone declarations of unconstitutionality from coming into effect. Graduation ceremony halted after masked university students rally at the event in Hong Kong Graduation ceremony halted after masked university students rally at the event in Hong Kong Its lawyers argued that striking down the ordinance's powers regarding public danger would severely tie the government's hands in dealing with the current state of serious public danger, and that lifting the mask ban would encourage participation in the already very violent protests, posing a threat to public safety.  They also argued the government needed to resolutely use all available legal means to stop the escalating violence, restore peace and prevent a small number of rioters from destroying the general public's rights and freedoms in daily life. But the two appellate judges questioned how the proposed order would meaningfully assist the government in dealing with the situation, and countered that the administration should instead consider asking the court to bring forward the hearing of the appeal. The Court of Appeal has set aside two days, from January 9, for the appeal to be heard. Anti-mask law to quell protests ruled unconstitutional 19 Nov 2019 Anti-mask law to quell protests ruled unconstitutional 19 Nov 2019 The pro-democracy bloc welcomed the latest ruling and also took the chance to urge the government to drop the appeal to avoid putting the courts in a difficult position. “The government should not take political issues and unconstitutional legal arguments to court,” said Council Front lawmaker Claudia Mo Man-ching. Civic Party lawmaker Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu also warned the anti-mask law could not mend the rifts in society. “To really address the problem, the government should respond to the five demands and come up with a political solution,” Yeung said.   Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, the former security minister and now an adviser to the city leader, said there was limited effect from the suspension of the mask ban. “Not a whole lot of people are arrested under the law, so the deterrent effect is only limited,” Ip said. She however said the more serious consequence was that invoking the emergency law was found unconstitutional. “It effectively means when the government faces a situation of public danger, it does not have an emergency power – that doesn’t make sense! All governments need some power in an emergency,” Ip said. She urged the government to appeal, and if necessary to seek an interpretation from Chinese national legislation, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress. Police had since November 18 suspended law enforcement of the ban and made no further arrests. Some 632 people had been arrested for offences under the regulation, as of November 14. Among them, 61 were charged for allegedly wearing a facial covering during a public assembly but none had been convicted. The Department of Justice said all ongoing proceedings for such offences would not proceed until the appeals were determined. But it refused to comment on its next move, saying the legal proceeding was still ongoing. 	SCMP

Carrie Lam dismisses rumours of cabinet reshuffle ahead of Beijing trip 10 Dec 2019 Carrie Lam dismisses rumours of cabinet reshuffle ahead of Beijing trip 10 Dec 2019 She also expressed concern over the arrest of 2,393 students – about 40 per cent of the more than 6,000 people taken into custody during six months of social unrest. social unrest Lam said those arrested included pupils from more than 300 secondary schools.  “Violence entering into school campus poses safety concerns for schools, parents, and students,” she said. “I have requested the Secretary for Education [Kevin Yeung Yun-hung] to seriously follow up on the teachers who are arrested.” She called on all schools to stop students from taking part in unlawful protests, and ask them to distance themselves from violent scenes as requested in a letter from Yeung on November 21. Education sector lawmaker and Professional Teachers’ Union vice-president Ip Kin-yuen worried Lam’s comments would put further pressure on the Education Bureau and schools when handling the cases of arrested teachers.  “I hope each and every case will be handled fairly and justly,” he said.  Ip, who said the union had approached some teachers who were arrested during the protests but most cases were still undergoing legal procedures, also felt the government should shoulder the most responsibility for students taking part in protests. But Wong Kam-leung, chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers, said it was “necessary” for the chief executive to make the comments. “Parents are worried if their children could still learn in a safe and rational environment at school, or if some teachers are encouraging the students to hit the streets?”  “Even when a teacher gets arrested, as long as one is not yet convicted, schools cannot terminate one’s employment and the most that can be done is to suspend one’s duties.” After poll loss, Hong Kong chief reveals apology to pro-Beijing candidates 10 Dec 2019 After poll loss, Hong Kong chief reveals apology to pro-Beijing candidates 10 Dec 2019 The Education Bureau said between June and early November they had looked into 106 cases related to teachers’ professional misconduct that were related to the protests. Of the 60 cases in which investigation had been completed, allegations were initially found to be true in about 30 cases. But follow up actions have not yet been decided. But the bureau said it would not disclose the number of arrested teachers because of ongoing legal proceedings. It added that it had asked the school where the teacher was arrested in Sheung Shui on Monday to suspend him from his duties to “protect students’ safety”, as it would also “seriously follow up” each and every teacher who has been complained, arrested or convicted. In the early hours of Monday, police arrested 10 men and two women at a car park in Tin Ping Estate in Sheung Shui, and seized home-made weapons including tubes with studs in them, and cans of petrol. The suspects were aged between 14 and 39, and included a teacher and six students, although a police source said the teacher and students were not from the same schools. It is understood that the teacher is from Hong Chi Morninglight School in Tuen Mun, an aided special school for students with intellectual disability. Officers believe the suspects gathered at the car park, and planned to set up roadblocks as part of the citywide strike that had been called for later that morning. Those arrested were taken into custody on suspicion of unlawful assembly and possession of instruments fit for unlawful purpose. As of 1pm on Tuesday, they were still being held for questioning and none had been charged. Speaking at a police briefing on Monday, Chief Superintendent Kenneth Kwok Ka-chuen said officers were alarmed by the presence of a teacher among those they arrested. “Teachers are supposed to nurture young talents and groom them into future leaders,” he said. “They certainly should make a clear stance against violence, and do all they can to prevent students from continuing with these destructive acts, instead of leading them to do so.” Gunman plan to ‘slaughter’ Hong Kong police officers revealed in court 9 Dec 2019 Gunman plan to ‘slaughter’ Hong Kong police officers revealed in court 9 Dec 2019 As of Monday, police had arrested 6,022 people aged from 11 to 84 since June, when the social unrest sparked by opposition to the now-withdrawn extradition bill began.

Two protesters have also been shot with live rounds. Separately, at Liu Po Shan Memorial College in Tsuen Wan on Monday, parents were warned in a letter that their children could face consequences if they took part in any form of political activities at school, which was issued just hours after dozens of students from the secondary school formed a human chain outside its gate, according to its student concern group. The school has not replied to a Post enquiry by press time.

Meeting the media on Tuesday ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lam did not answer questions on whether national security legislation would be discussed during her trip to the capital this weekend. However, she did respond to continued suggestions of a reshuffle, rumours further fuelled by media reports that her justice secretary, Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah, asked to resign last month. “From time to time in the last few months, there have always been some rumours and speculation about a reshuffling of our team, including the principal officials and the executive councillors,” Lam said. “My first priority now is to restore law and order in Hong Kong … [reshuffling] is not an immediate task that I would afford the attention to.” The chief executive, her cabinet and her ministerial team have been under increasing pressure from the public to be held accountable for the fiasco of the now-withdrawn extradition bill, which triggered widespread protests. Hong Kong has been swept up in chaos and violence since June.  Speaking on Tuesday, which is Human Rights Day around the world, Lam also insisted the city’s rights and freedoms had not been eroded, and lawmakers should refrain from “bad-mouthing” Hong Kong. She said a major protest march on Sunday – which attracted 800,000 people, by organisers’ estimates – reflected the freedoms Hongkongers enjoy. But, while acknowledging the procession was largely peaceful, she condemned those who firebombed the High Court and Court of Final Appeal buildings. ‘Deplorable’ petrol bomb attacks on Hong Kong courts condemned 10 Dec 2019 ‘Deplorable’ petrol bomb attacks on Hong Kong courts condemned 10 Dec 2019 Asked if she would heed protesters’ demands for an independent inquiry into police and amnesty for those arrested, she said her administration had been listening to the public for several months.

Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor accepted the result signalled voters’ “dissatisfaction with the government”, while analysts said her pick of guests suggested the government was putting low priority to please average voters. It was the first time the city leader – who was yet to meet any of the victorious pan-democrats – openly apologised to her allies since they suffered a humiliating reversal two weeks ago, losing control of 17 out of 18 district councils amid long-running unrest fuelled by anger at Lam and her administration. Pro-Beijing candidates won only 60 out of 452 seats. suffered a humiliating reversal Speaking ahead of her weekly Executive Council meeting, Lam said she had met members of the pro-establishment camp recently, adding that the government was at least partly responsible for the election result. The defeat of the pro-establishment camp undeniably has a direct relationship with the government Chief Executive Carrie Lam “The defeat of the pro-establishment camp undeniably has a direct relationship with the government,” she said, saying many voters did not care about candidates’ performances in their districts but “merely expressed their dissatisfaction with the government”. “From this perspective, it is only natural for me to offer apologies to the pro-establishment candidates,” she said. “I do not evade this stance as chief executive, whether privately or openly.”  When asked if she would appoint the defeated candidates in public office, such as the advisory and statutory bodies, as a pro-government paper reported, Lam said the relationship with some parties would not change just because they lost the elections. Two days after the November 24 election, Lam conceded only that the government had a “certain impact” on its allies’ results.  The election, which drew a record 71.2 per cent turnout, was seen as a showdown for government, months after it inadvertently sparked the angry protests with a controversial extradition bill, which it has since withdrawn. The initial protests have spread over the past half-year into a wider push for greater democracy and police accountability. Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing camp reeling after crushing defeat in district council elections Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing camp reeling after crushing defeat in district council elections Lam has arranged several rounds of meetings with the pro-establishment parties, with another cross-party massive tea gathering to be held next Saturday at the Government House.  A source revealed that Lam had reportedly told more than 10 defeated candidates from the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions in a Monday meeting that “their working relationship would go on” when asked if she would consider appointing them to any government advisory bodies. Lam is set to meet two other parties – Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong and the New People’s Party – on Wednesday. But some have snubbed the meeting, with a defeated veteran from the DAB saying he had no interest to meet Lam. “I have more important things to do,” the incumbent councillor who wished to remain anonymous said. Judy Chan Ka-pui of the New People’s Party, who lost the re-election in South Horizons West, said she would attend the meeting to urge Lam to solve the ongoing crisis. “An apology won’t help the situation. We will urge Lam to restart dialogues with various communities as an urgent remedy to regain people’s trust in the government,” she said. Ivan Choy Chi-keung, a senior lecturer in politics at Chinese University, said Lam’s gesture to meet her defeated allies before the victorious pan-democratic camp had reflected the government’s priority was not to regain the support of the average voters. “I think Lam may take concrete actions to compensate her allies as she needs their support more than ever to maintain governance when her popularity rating has plunged to a record low,” he said. On the other hand, the pan-democrats, who have yet to hear any invitation from Lam or the Home Affairs Bureau, warned the chief executive not to appoint the defeated candidates into public office. “People have cast them out. Appointing the defeated candidates in the advisory bodies are like turning the public against as enemies,” Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting said. Looking ahead, Lam said the government would respect the incoming legion of pro-democracy district councillors, and treat them the same as any other councillors, while expecting them to respect the usual rules and conventions. On Monday, the government issued a statement saying Lam had been considering whether she would attend the monthly question and answer session at the Legislative Council. Lam noted on Tuesday that she initiated the monthly sessions, on top of the four regular sessions per year, to enhance communication with the legislature. But she said she doubted the value of the meetings, for the time being after chaos and disruptions in October. She said she would attend the regular session in mid-January on a trial basis. If that goes smoothly, she said, she would be happy to continue attending the monthly sessions. 	SCMP

The apparent bomb plot, which emerged after six months of social unrest and political turmoil, prompted the city’s biggest police association to warn that the current security situation was at its “most alarming” in decades, even worse than during a wave of armed robberies in the 1990s. Superintendent Lau Siu-pong said on the official police Facebook page that more explosives and firearms could be similarly hidden across the city, and the two bombs were fully functional and primed to kill and maim. “We suspect that criminals temporarily stored the bombs there and intended to detonate them elsewhere,” Lau said. “Based on our intelligence and initial investigation, we believe it might not be an isolated case.” Police insiders told the Post the would-be bombers were forced to abandon the attack planned for Sunday after a group of their associates were arrested in a raid that morning, hours before the march – which attracted hundreds of thousands – started at Victoria Park in Causeway Bay. Post The bombs, packed with 5kg (11lb) each of high-grade explosives along with shrapnel in the form of nails, were not intended to target Wah Yan College Hong Kong in Wan Chai, where they were found, sources said.  “The devices containing nails were designed to cause a lot of casualties in the attack,” one police source said. “We believe their target was police officers.” He added that intelligence indicated the gang had discussed in online conversations the use of explosives to attack police, and had used a flat, possibly in Wan Chai, as a bomb factory. The Sunday swoop happened at daybreak, police raiding three flats in Wan Chai, North Point and Chai Wan. They arrested 11 people and seized weapons including a pistol, 105 bullets, two bulletproof vests and some retractable batons.  “The school is just five minutes away from the flat in Wan Chai that we raided on Sunday,” the source said.   Officers suspected the gang, upon hearing of the raid, took the two bombs, hidden inside two black rubbish bags, to the slope under a Wah Yan College building.  Someone claiming to be a school cleaner spotted the bombs under a building supported by pillars on a slope at about 5.30pm on Monday, though the force suspected he was really a rough sleeper. Bomb disposal officers later defused the devices. It was understood that the remote-controlled weapons – which officers said had a potential blast radius of up to 100 metres – would not have gone off on the slope, because two mobile phones connected to them, for use as detonators, were turned off. Another source said the chemicals used to make the explosives were difficult to get hold of, and police were investigating whether they had been stolen from local universities. Hong Kong police carry out rare explosives demonstration Hong Kong police carry out rare explosives demonstration He said officers were also investigating whether the Wan Chai bombs were linked with another device hidden in a flower pot in Mong Kok and detonated in October, soon after police officers moved in to clear protesters’ roadblocks nearby. No officers were injured in that explosion. The source added that the Mong Kok device – unlike those found at the school – contained highly volatile triacetone triperoxide, or TATP, and it was similarly controlled with a mobile phone. On Tuesday, officers were checking CCTV footage from along Queen’s Road East in Wan Chai and nearby areas, to gather evidence. ‘Deplorable’ petrol bomb attacks on Hong Kong courts condemned 10 Dec 2019 ‘Deplorable’ petrol bomb attacks on Hong Kong courts condemned 10 Dec 2019 Lam Chi-wai, chairman of the Junior Police Officers’ Association, described the current security risk as the most “alarming” since the city’s return to Chinese rule in 1997, and even more worrying than during the armed-robbery epidemic of that decade. “I would have never thought of such security threats six months ago, when the anti-government protests began,” Lam said. “People are getting violent and audacious. Whatever people suggest on social media as ways to hurt police, some other person can make it happen. Now ordinary people could face bomb threats even when they go out.” Over the past six months, Hong Kong has been rocked by the anti-government movement sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, with increasingly violent clashes between protesters and police. On Sunday, the Court of Final Appeal in Central and the High Court in Admiralty were firebombed during a mass rally, triggering alarm that radicals were starting to target the judiciary. firebombed during a mass rally Since June, police have arrested 6,022 people aged between 11 and 84 years over offences related to the protests, 2,392 of them students. Police also found more than 10,000 petrol bombs at several universities in November after protesters barricaded themselves on campuses and fought officers. Wah Yan College said there was no evidence linking the devices to any members of the school, as students sat their exams as scheduled on Tuesday morning. “The site where the bombs were uncovered belong to the school, but it is an open area outside the gates that can be accessed by the public,” the school said in a statement. So Ying-lun, an assistant school supervisor, said they had “not found any evidence pointing at teachers or students responsible for placing or making the bomb”, but the area the devices were found in was not covered by security cameras. A Form Six student surnamed Law said he passed by the area the bombs were found several times on Monday. “I was a bit worried because the bomb was placed right in the school,” he said. But Chan, 13, a Form One student who declined to give his full name, suspected the bomb could have been planted by outsiders as the campus sits on a hill surrounded by public roads. “I don’t think any of our students could do such a thing,” Chan said. A student in Form Three, who gave his name as Tsang, said he learned a bomb had been found on campus through social media on Monday night. “I was not too worried to go to school today, at least the bombs were removed.” he said. “I don’t think our students made them.” A father who was dropping his son off at school by car said a notice had been posted online last night assuring parents the school was safe. “It should be safe. I will also come to pick up my son after his exam,” the father, who gave his surname as Hon, said. 	SCMP

Last week, Hong Kong student representatives, including Baptist University Student Union president Keith Fong Chung-yin, visited the self-ruled island to lobby government representatives for greater measures to protect Hong Kong residents looking to settle there long-term, including speeding up passage of the refugee bill. It is estimated that about 200 Hong Kong protesters have arrived in Taiwan to avoid arrest since the anti-extradition protests began in June, with many staying on short-term tourist visas that last for a maximum of 30 days but can be extended. Taiwan has no formal legislation for processing asylum applications but its laws promise to help Hong Kong and Macau citizens “whose safety and liberty are immediately threatened for political reasons”. Fong, who visited Taiwan with members of the Hong Kong Higher Institutions International Affairs delegation between Monday and Thursday last week, expressed concern over the government’s failure to make progress on the matter.  “If the DPP only verbally supports the Hong Kong protests without implementing concrete measures to support protesters, it’s inevitable that people will suspect that the DPP only wants to exchange Hongkongers’ sacrifices for Taiwanese people’s votes,” Fong wrote on Facebook. Taiwan’s minor political parties could play a major role in upcoming elections 8 Dec 2019 Taiwan’s minor political parties could play a major role in upcoming elections 8 Dec 2019 The mainland-friendly KMT seized on his comments saying: “When [Fong] said that the DPP has capitalised on the bloodshed of Hong Kong people for its own electoral gain, it proved that President Tsai and the DPP have used the Hong Kong issue as an electoral manoeuvre.” “It is highly improper for both Tsai and her party to pay lip service by lying on the one hand that they support Hong Kong people’s fight for democracy and freedom, but on the other hand refusing to heed the voices of the Hong Kong people.”  Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, however, denied that the government is trying to use the Hong Kong issue to make political gains.   “The government has long showed concern about the situation in Hong Kong and support of the democratic movement there,” it said.  The council said that Fong had misunderstood the island’s stance on Hong Kong issues and how Taipei deals with Hong Kong residents seeking shelter on the island. “The government will deal with cases with humanitarian concern and in line with relevant laws,” it said. While the Hong Kong protests have received widespread public support in Taiwan, they have also heightened people’s concerns about the perceived failure of “one country, two systems” – which Beijing has proposed as a model for the island’s reunification with the mainland. Various opinion polls have shown that Tsai is far ahead of her KMT opponent Han Kuo-yu in a campaign in which her vocal support for the Hong Kong protesters has become a key factor. Tsai and the DPP have said repeatedly they will do all they can to help protesters seeking shelter in Taiwan. She has also criticised the Hong Kong government and police for their handling of the anti-extradition protests that have spiralled into violence, further bolstering Taiwan’s image as a beacon of democracy and human rights. Fong later clarified his Facebook post. “We have always appreciated the Taiwanese people and government’s stance towards the anti-extradition movement and the Hong Kong people,” he told the South China Morning Post. South China Morning Post   “But on the other hand, we really hope that the Taiwan government can implement specific laws to guarantee the safety of Hongkongers in Taiwan. “In reality, we can see that the Taiwan government has not made any changes to its existing legislation. So Hong Kong people are feeling confused and don’t know how to proceed.” Last week Hsu Yung-ming, the leader of Taiwan’s pro-independence New Power Party, used a news conference with Fong to urge the government to introduce the refugee law or revise existing laws to protect Hongkongers facing persecution or jail terms for their role in the protests. So far, more than 6,000 people have been arrested during the six months of protests, which have evolved from opposing a now-withdrawn extradition bill to calling for universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into the police’s conduct. Although only a fraction of those arrested have been charged so far, the most severe charges of rioting can carry a jail term of 10 years. Critics say that the existing means for Hongkongers to legally settle in Taiwan – for example, by securing an investment visa, starting a business or finding a job above a certain salary level – are limited, expensive and too slow. Tsai has also given mixed messages on the refugee bill, which was first proposed in 2016 to offer asylum to stateless people fleeing war or natural disasters but is still languishing in the legislature. She told a Taipei youth forum on Wednesday that there was no need for Taiwan to institute the refugee law, as current regulations governing the island’s relations with Hong Kong and Macau are sufficient to deal with the issue. Tsai played a leading role in drafting the legislation in the 1990s and said that she had “taken into account that China might not live up to its promises” and included clauses that would provide a legal basis for Hongkongers “who have suffered from persecution and unfair treatment” to come to Taiwan to study and work. The Hong Kong protests have affected Taiwan’s election – but Beijing won’t back down 7 Dec 2019 The Hong Kong protests have affected Taiwan’s election – but Beijing won’t back down 7 Dec 2019 “Since we already have those clauses in the regulations, no refugee law is needed for the time being.” In September, Taiwan’s interior ministry said the refugee bill would not apply to Hong Kong residents or mainland Chinese. “The existing mechanism has been working well and relevant authorities would deal with the asylum seekers on a case-by-case basis and in line with the international practices as well as human rights conventions,” the ministry said. Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung had visited the island that month to urge Taiwanese lawmakers to offer more concrete support for Hong Kong residents fleeing arrest. 	SCMP

Hong Kong’s anti-government protests The release by Russia Today (RT) of the documentary, Hong Kong Unmasked, comes as Beijing and Moscow have upgraded their ties to a “strategic partnership”. Hong Kong Unmasked “strategic partnership” The production focuses on the protests that have rocked the city since June and cites Beijing’s claims of interference in Hong Kong’s November district council elections, in which pro-democracy candidates won all but a handful of seats. “Although there seems to be a conscious choice to brand this surge of protests as a leaderless movement, individuals, political parties and organisations are giving this movement its direction, and US officials are openly colluding with this opposition,” RT reporter Michele Greenstein says in the production. China has repeatedly protested over what it regards as unfair international media coverage of the movement.

The West has its narrative, but Russia and China are presenting their own,” Lukin said.

Claire S. Lee, an assistant professor at South Korea’s Inha University and author of the book Soft Power Made in China, said media cooperation with foreign partners was important for China because it “aspires to be a global power”. Soft Power Made in China “It’s important for China to have foreign media outlets who support its views.

One place where the Russian production received a positive response was in China, where subtitled segments of the documentary posted on RT’s official Weibo account last week were shared thousands of times. “Thanks for all your hard work,” one user on the Twitter-like Weibo platform wrote. “There are not many media that can help China in public opinion.” “Can you invite RT to report on Xinjiang?,” wrote another, referring to “unreliable” Western reports of human rights abuses against Muslim minorities in the western China region. “It's all malicious interpretation.” 	SCMP

A day after the entrances of the Court of Final Appeal in Central and the High Court in Admiralty were firebombed, calls for a citywide strike to mark six months of civil unrest went mostly unheeded. A rubbish bin thrown onto the MTR tracks near Sha Tin station caused a temporary suspension of services along the East Rail Line, but no serious disruptions were reported elsewhere. Calls to paralyse traffic came a day after 800,000 people – according to organisers’ estimates – took part in a police-approved march on Sunday, held for the first time since August by the Civil Human Rights Front. Hong Kong police carry out rare explosives demonstration Hong Kong police carry out rare explosives demonstration While Sunday’s march was mostly peaceful, some protesters turned to violence on the sidelines. Two petrol bombs were thrown at the front door of the Court of Final Appeal at around 7pm, four hours after protesters took off from Causeway Bay for Chater Garden, where the top court is located.  The attack at the High Court’s front gate came earlier in the day. Several broken bottles and a burned carpet were found at the scene. The entrance was spray-painted with the message, “Rule of Law is dead”. Cowardly petrol bomb attacks on city’s police must be condemned 8 Jun 2019 Cowardly petrol bomb attacks on city’s police must be condemned 8 Jun 2019 Before heading into his office in the top court building on Monday, Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma Tao-li inspected the damage but did not make any comments. The Hong Kong Bar Association “deplored” the violence against the judiciary “in the strongest terms”.  “People who commit such acts are not genuine protesters but criminals,” it said in a statement. “They must be brought to justice.” The Law Society, the city’s professional body for solicitors, also issued a strong condemnation of the attack on “judicial integrity and independence”.  “Venting dissatisfaction by throwing petrol bombs at court buildings and vandalising property must be abhorred,” the Law Society said in a statement, a day after its president, Melissa Pang Kaye, expressed shock over the attacks. “Those who commit these criminal acts must stop taking the law into their own hands.

Front convenor Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit spoke out against the attacks, urging the public to protect the courts. At a media briefing on Monday afternoon, police dismissed speculation about any involvement of undercover officers, condemning the arson attacks as “destructive acts” against judicial independence. A group that has become the de facto voice of the protesters would not condemn the attacks, claiming instead that the courts had become toothless tools for police to use against the public.

Five suspects, aged between 20 and 23, were charged at Eastern Court on Monday with various offences including conspiracy to wound others with intent and possessing arms or ammunition without a licence. Two were granted bail. Chief Superintendent Kwok Ka-chuen of the Police Public Relations Branch said 6,022 people aged between 11 and 84 had been arrested since June 9 – 2,392, or almost 39.7 per cent, of them students.

Meanwhile, there were further signs showing that the relationship between the executive and legislative branches has worsened. In a letter to the Legislative Council, the government’s administrative wing revealed that they were reviewing whether the city’s embattled leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor would continue to address Legco once a month to answer lawmakers’ questions, as opposition legislators had stopped Lam from delivering her annual policy address in October.

The number of security guards will be doubled for this year’s expo – the 54th since being established in 1938 – at Victoria Park, according to the organiser, the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association of Hong Kong (CMA). The guards will include ones who are more professionally qualified and some of foreign nationality. This year all visitors to the 22-day expo will have to go through security checks at the entrance. Banned items include dangerous objects, promotional materials carrying political messages, and non-drinkable liquids, the CMA said. Hong Kong has been engulfed by protests, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, for six months. Many events have been cancelled because of security concerns. protests Some on LIHKG – an online forum popular with protesters – have made vague threats about the fair, which this year has fewer exhibitors, hours that have been cut back and a run shortened by two days. Fewer visitors are also forecast. CMA chief executive Raymond Young Lap-moon said the association decided to go ahead with the fair after serious deliberation.  “Hong Kong is in a very unusual period,” he said. “But we have organised the annual expo as a tradition in Hong Kong for decades. We don’t want to suspend it for any reason.” More than 5,600 retail workers face axe as protests hit economy, survey finds 10 Dec 2019 More than 5,600 retail workers face axe as protests hit economy, survey finds 10 Dec 2019 CMA vice-president Marvin Hsu added: “Millions of people are used to visiting the expo every year. So even though it is very challenging for us to organise a large-scale event in the current situation, we don’t want to disappoint Hong Kong citizens, and therefore, we will do our very best to ensure the expo runs smoothly.” Hsu said it would be the first time security checks were carried out at the event. The association had also worked with the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, Transport Department and police to deal with emergency situations. Ahead of the opening, the association held a drill with exhibitors in case of possible emergencies, Hsu said.   “There were no security checks at previous events because Hong Kong was always a safe city,” he said. “But we adopted them this time to ensure the safety of exhibitors and visitors.”  According to the Hong Kong Tourism Board, the number of tourist arrivals plunged 43.7 per cent year on year in October to 3.31 million – the worst decline in a single month since protests began in June. tourist arrivals plunged 43.7 per cent  The expo typically attracts more than 2 million visitors each year. But the organiser expected a plunge in visitor numbers this year, especially those from mainland China who accounted for 20 per cent of the total turnout at previous events. those from mainland China Sales revenue was also expected to drop 20 to 30 per cent, Hsu said. HK$80 ‘lucky bags’ to lure bargain hunters to Victoria Park expo 5 Dec 2018 HK$80 ‘lucky bags’ to lure bargain hunters to Victoria Park expo 5 Dec 2018 The number of exhibitors dropped about 26 per cent from 435 in 2018 to 323 this year, with a total of 700 booths compared with last year’s 880, the CMA said. To ease the financial burden on businesses and attract more visitors, the organiser offered a 30 per cent rental discount to exhibitors, and slashed the entrance price from HK$12 to HK$8. Hsu noted that Hong Kong’s businesses had been hit by the months-long political unrest and the US-China trade war. “We hope the expo can assist small and medium-sized enterprises in getting through these difficult times,” he said. US-China trade war Nam Pei Hong Sum Yung Drugs Company, which sells products such as health food, herbs and tea, has attended the expo for more than a decade. It will offer discounted products this year, including tea and abalone products for only HK$1. Johnny Chui, the company’s associate business development manager, said he was not particularly worried about security but expected a 30 per cent drop in sales revenue this year. “We have attended the expo for over 10 years. It has become our tradition,” Chui said. “If something happens, we will follow the organiser’s guidelines and put safety first.” Hong Kong: a city locked in stalemate with no end in sight 9 Dec 2019 Hong Kong: a city locked in stalemate with no end in sight 9 Dec 2019 He said the shorter opening hours would affect sales and he expected shoppers to spend an average of about HK$1,000 each, compared with about HK$1,200 last year. The expo, cut short from 24 days previously, will open from 11am to 8pm daily, closing two hours earlier than last year. On December 31, its last day, the fair will close at 6pm. Discounted products and special offers, such as two 1kg bags of rice for HK$1, would be up for grabs. Prizes worth HK$3.8 million in total would be given out throughout the expo, the organiser said.

The defendants charged at Eastern Court on Monday were among 11 suspects arrested a day earlier, in what police described as the first protest-related case where a gun had been seized. 11 suspects arrested a day earlier The court heard suggestions were made on social messaging app Telegram to place two explosive devices on a section of Hennessy Road between Fleming Road and Stewart Road in Wan Chai, which demonstrators would walk past during the protest. social messaging app Telegram Wan Chai Maps outlining the conspiracy also showed a proposed gunman – not among the five who appeared in court – stationed nearby, whose task would be to draw police officers out and commence a “slaughter that would mark the first wave of attack,” senior public prosecutor William Siu Kai-yip told the court. The defendants – unemployed Wong Chun-keung, 21, engineering assistant Ng Chi-hung, 23, Open University student Cheung Chun-fu, 22, transport worker Cheung Ming-yu, 20, and vocational college student Yim Man-him, 21 – were each charged with one count of conspiracy to wound with intent. Ng faced an additional charge of possession of firearms and ammunition without a licence and possession of offensive weapons or other instrument fit for unlawful purpose.  The prosecution alleged Ng had kept a pistol, four magazines and 106 rounds of ammunition without the required licences at a flat in North Point. They also accused Ng of possessing a samurai knife and two sabre knives at the same flat, with intent to use them for unlawful purposes. Cheung, who faced a similar second charge, was accused of having 11 extendable batons, four bottles of pepper spray, 13 ceramic plates used to make bulletproof vests, firecrackers and a laser pointer, stored in a warehouse in Tsuen Wan.

Barrister Edward Poon Ting-bond, representing Wong, said his client had been punched and kicked by police officers who raided in his flat on the day of arrest. He added Wong had been given no opportunity to seek medical help after the assault.  Magistrate Lam Tsz-kan arranged the next hearing on February 18. He granted cash bail to Cheung Ming-yu and Yim at HK$8,000 and HK$10,000 (US$1,000 and US$1,300) respectively, but ordered the other three be remanded in custody.

A sharp divide in personal beliefs has also opened up along generations, according to the survey, with youngsters saying freedoms are the most important core value for Hongkongers, while their parents prefer social stability. “Recent protests have triggered vigorous discussions, arguments, and even conflicts between generations, who hold sharply different values,” researcher Christine Chan of Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups said at a press briefing on Monday. “Baby boomers born after the second world war want stability above everything else, while young people born in a more affluent society after the 1990s consider their values and their own way of life as of bigger importance than economic growth.”  Social unrest, sparked by fierce opposition to the now-withdrawn extradition bill, has roiled Hong Kong for six months, splitting family, friends and the civil society at large. The opposition to the controversial bill has morphed into a wider anti-government movement focusing on five demands, which include greater democracy and an independent investigation into police’s handling of protests. now-withdrawn extradition bill  The survey was conducted by a research panel of the federation in October among 300 youths aged between 18 and 29 and 302 parents aged between 54 and 73.  The results showed 42 per cent of the young interviewees had frequently or occasionally argued with their parents over the past few months, among which 71 per cent said those arguments were over “current affairs”. Hong Kong: a city locked in stalemate with no end in sight Hong Kong: a city locked in stalemate with no end in sight Economic issues, including spending habits, were the second top reason (59 per cent) for having arguments, followed by social life (26 per cent) and academic issues (24 per cent).  In contrast, most people from the older generation, or 56 per cent of those surveyed, said economic and spending issues were the most common topics of arguments, followed by current affairs (42 per cent), social life (23 per cent) and academic issues (21 per cent).  Another key intergenerational difference was in people’s personal beliefs, with young respondents ranking freedoms as the most important core value in Hong Kong, which received an average score of 8.18 out of 10, followed by equality (7.96), democracy (7.84), rule of law (7.71) and social stability (7.39). But, their parents considered social stability to be the most important value (7.77). Freedoms (7.14) and democracy (6.30) came fourth and last respectively. The research team recommended a host of policies to bridge the gap between people from different generations in the city, including more town hall meetings by newly elected district council members to bring together Hongkongers of all ages. How peaceful marches escalated to intense violence and a bitterly divided society 10 Oct 2019 How peaceful marches escalated to intense violence and a bitterly divided society 10 Oct 2019 “More opportunities of interaction and communication between generations will enhance understanding of each other and lead to fewer arguments,” research team convenor Alan Yip Tsz-chung said. Yip added that most young interviewees and their parents – 76 per cent and 77 per cent respectively – chose “alleviation of housing problems for the young” as the top solution to improve intergenerational relations. The second most popular recommendation for the young people was “listening more to young voices in policymaking” (57 per cent), followed by “more career opportunities for the young” (42 per cent). For their parents, the second most popular policy suggestion was “better welfare support for the elderly” (67 per cent), followed by “more career opportunities for the young” (39 per cent). The five demands named by protesters were not among the options available in the survey. 	SCMP

The grim statistics were released on Monday by the Hong Kong Retail Management Association which surveyed 176 businesses running 4,310 stores and employing 33 per cent of the sector’s workforce, between October 29 and November 22. Association chairwoman Annie Tse Yau On-yee warned of a chain reaction that would further hurt an economy already in recession. already in recession “This is the worst on record,” Tse said. “We don’t know when it will get to the bottom as it is uncertain when peace will be restored to society. Even if it stabilises, it will be a long road before Hong Kong rebuilds its international reputation and tourists return to the city.” Hong Kong has been battered since June by protests sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, with no end in sight. protests extradition bill The protests have evolved into a wider anti-government campaign, which has descended into violence and chaos, including the blocking of roads, transport and business disruptions, and the destruction of shops, restaurants and banks with mainland China connections.  The trouble has spilled into shopping malls and commercial, tourist and residential areas such as Causeway Bay, Tsim Sha Tsui, Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, Sha Tin and Tseung Kwan O. Tourist arrivals, a key driver of consumption, plunged 43.7 per cent in October, the sharpest fall since May 2003, when the city was hit by the Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic.  Tse noted that apparel, footwear, health and beauty, and jewellery retailers were hit hard.   In October, retail sales shrank 24.3 per cent year on year, the worst performance since government records started in January 1981.  The city is also caught in the crossfire of the US-China trade war. About 30 per cent of the 176 companies covered in the survey said they would lay off 10 per cent of staff in the coming six months. Tse said the companies planning lay-offs employed 21 per cent of the industry’s 270,000-strong work force, which meant more than 5,600 people would lose jobs. Those polled included companies running chain stores and individual small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). “This means more than 5,600 families will be affected,” she said. “When these families have lower or no income, their spending power will be hurt and their mortgage repayments will be affected, too.” Hundreds in Hong Kong rally against use of tear gas Hundreds in Hong Kong rally against use of tear gas Some 97 per cent of the companies were losing money. About 11 per cent of those polled said they would fold their businesses in the coming six months. Tse said based on the 64,000 business registrations of retail firms in Hong Kong, at least 7,000 companies could be included. She said a minority of retailers had managed to obtain rent cuts from landlords. “Most landlords are still dragging their feet on lowering rents and of those who offer lower rents, the help is too little to make any difference,” she said.

Tse said the industry’s priority was to cut costs even though some pro-business lawmakers had floated the idea of the government boosting consumption by issuing consumer coupons worth HK$10,000 to each Hong Kong resident. “The key is having peace return to the city,” she said. Overseas students in the US debate on Hong Kong protests Overseas students in the US debate on Hong Kong protests Iris Pang, ING’s economist for Greater China, said landlords, particularly those running malls, were unlikely to offer any significant rent reductions to avoid hurting the valuation of their properties. “They may prefer to leave properties vacant rather than cutting rents,” she said. When the retail sector could bounce back, Pang said, would depend on the extent and frequency of violence. “The issues are that protests evolved into violence and roads are easily blocked by radicals without warning,” she said. “The unrest may last for years. Retailers should think about longer-term strategies.” She said retailers in Causeway Bay, the site of clashes between radicals and police, could consider relocating to densely populated local communities. For the full year, Pang expected Hong Kong retail sales would drop 20 per cent from 2018. 	SCMP

Wong Sio-chak refused to explain why the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (AmCham) chairman Robert Grieves and president Tara Joseph were denied entry to Macau, but said linking the decision with the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act passed in the US last month was “speculation”. Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act Speaking at a public event in Macau on Sunday, he insisted “safety risks and threats” were the only considerations in such decisions, adding he only learned about the case through the media. Heads of US business group in Hong Kong denied entry to Macau 11 Dec 2019 Heads of US business group in Hong Kong denied entry to Macau 11 Dec 2019 The business chiefs were separately prevented from entering the city, which is part of China but promised a high degree of autonomy, as they travelled to the annual AmCham Macau Ball on Saturday. Defending the right of countries and territories to enforce their immigration policy, Wong said: “Police have the responsibility to ensure Macau’s safety, and the same principle applies to port control.  “When [police immigration officers] carry out duties according to laws, the identities and occupations of the persons entering Macau are not their consideration. Safety risks and threats are the only considerations.” Wong offered no further explanation for why the two AmCham leaders were refused entry, insisting he only knew about the decisions through the media and would not comment on individual cases.  The incident came as Macau, a former Portuguese colony, prepares to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its handover to China later this month.  Wong was asked by the media whether the refusal was in retaliation against the US Congress passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which was signed by President Donald Trump at the end of last month. Wong said it was simply “speculation” to think so. Wong said it was simply “speculation” to think so. The legislation, which requires the US government to regularly assess Hong Kong’s autonomy to preserve its special trading status, paves the way for diplomatic action and economic sanctions against the city’s government. It was pursued by American lawmakers in response to the anti-government protests that have gripped Hong Kong for six months. anti-government protests Organisers estimated 800,000 people attended a march on Hong Kong Island on Sunday, where activists championed the five demands of the protest movement, which was sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill in June. five demands now-withdrawn extradition bill US House approves Hong Kong bill, Beijing strongly condemns move 16 Oct 2019 US House approves Hong Kong bill, Beijing strongly condemns move 16 Oct 2019 After the bill was passed in Washington, Beijing warned of possible sanctions against US non-governmental organisations and human rights bodies. But it did not warn of similar treatment for business chambers. AmCham has said it was “puzzled” about the denial of entry, adding the chamber was supportive of the development of business in the Greater Bay Area, the national scheme to integrate Hong Kong, Macau and nine Guangdong cities into an economic powerhouse to rival Silicon Valley. Joseph said on Monday morning she had no further comment for now following Wong’s remarks. 	SCMP

Measures such as online ­seminars to allow students to ­continue learning – after face-to-face sessions were axed – have led some to ask for refunds on their tuition fees. But others were angered after staff insisted they returned to their vandalised universities despite safety concerns for grounds that hosted clashes involving tear gas and petrol bombs. Classes at 11 public and privately funded universities, as well as most of the higher education institutions under the banner of the Vocational Training Council (VTC), were cancelled for the rest of term after campuses emerged in mid-November as a new battleground between police and diehard protesters. privately funded universities At least six universities were damaged, while radical protesters occupied Chinese and Polytechnic universities and surrounding areas, blocking roads and attacking officers with petrol bombs. Police responded with thousands of rounds of tear gas.  The most intense violence was at PolyU, where police besieged hardline protesters trapped on the campus for nearly two weeks. police besieged hardline protesters trapped on the campus Bruce Lui Ping-kuen, a senior lecturer at Baptist University’s department of journalism, said although the campus had largely returned to normal, management were still advising teachers to hold lessons outside university grounds. Lui said the department had booked function rooms at a four-star hotel in nearby Kowloon City for lectures and provided free buffets for students. But he said attendance was only about 50 per cent so far.  While he had uploaded teaching materials online for his courses, and met students in small groups over meals outside campus, he said internet-based learning was flawed.  “Online teaching is after all often seen as getting half the results with twice the effort without the flexibility of face-to-face lessons … where deeper discussions can be facilitated,” he said. Some students from the university were also dissatisfied with the way online teaching was conducted by some teachers, and have demanded a refund.  “For online teaching, students expected lecturers to upload videos or recordings, but most lecturers only chose to upload lecture notes online, which is not much different to self-learning,” he said. Fong also said the student union has been discussing the possibility of refunds with school management, but a decision had yet to be made from the university. Tuition fees for local students are generally set at HK$42,100 per year (US$5,380) at universities with government subsidies, while for non-locals the fee is at about HK$140,000. Students at VTC’s Hong Kong Design Institute (HKDI) have started a petition demanding refunds. A first-year student there, who called herself Duck, said: “Students feel angry because tuition fees have been paid in full … and I feel what I’ve learned is just 10 per cent of [what I would have learned in] face-to-face lessons.” In a response to the Post, Baptist University said it had received feedback from students and staff on the arrangements for classes and exams in the wake of the protests, adding “refinements have been taken” after careful consideration. Post But both Baptist University and HKDI did not say whether they would consider partial or other refunds to students’ tuition fees.

How Hong Kong protests have revolutionised campus norms 7 Dec 2019 How Hong Kong protests have revolutionised campus norms 7 Dec 2019 Meanwhile at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), exams were conducted online and students asked to record a video that “clearly shows the face of the student taking the exam”, as evidence they had not cheated. Both student unions at HKU and Chinese University had received complaints from students over what they saw as the premature return to campus, following requests from lecturers they said were in conflict with senior management’s decision that alternative teaching methods should be used. The acting president of HKU’s student union, Aaron Chan Hei-long, said some lecturers had switched to online teaching, while negotiations on teaching methods were ongoing for others. “Students [have] experienced different degrees of difficulty in coming back to campus … let alone exchange students who have already left Hong Kong for their home country under the university's announcement and instructions,” he said. An HKU spokeswoman said teachers were encouraged to be flexible and most of the written examinations at the end of this semester had moved online or were replaced by alternative assessment arrangements. Chinese University said faculties had “started to adopt alternative modes of teaching and assessment”. Lee Ho-yin, HKU’s head of division of architectural conservation programmes, said there was a silver lining to the disruption in that some academics were forced to embrace new technology, adding he had learned how to make group video calls on WhatsApp, the instant messaging application. new technology, adding he had learned how to make group video calls on WhatsApp, the instant messaging application. “[Older lecturers] used to think, ‘there’s no need to learn these online-based modes of teaching yet’,” he said. “But now that there’s this chance, it has forced us to learn quickly, and in fact I think this is going to be useful for future teaching as well.” 	SCMP

The so-called leaderless ­revolution that has wreaked such havoc across the city – on main roads and side streets, at the ­airport and metro stations, in shopping malls and on university campuses – is not finished yet. not finished yet There was a respite of two weeks around the landmark ­November 24 district council elections, which swept aside ­pro-establishment candidates and installed pan-democratic majorities from the opposition in 17 out of 18 districts, a stunning reversal attributed to the months of protests and voters’ deep dissatisfaction with the government. Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections But radical protesters and their supporters were out again on December 1, clashing with ­police and driving home the ­message that they would not be satisfied until all their demands were met. The movement scored a ­success when the government withdrew its detested extradition bill that triggered the protests in June over fears that fugitives might be sent to the mainland, as well as other jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no official transfer arrangement. detested extradition bill  But the protest movement wants more, especially a commission of inquiry into allegations of police brutality, and beyond that, universal suffrage for the city. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor is in no haste to satisfy these and other demands, which she has repeatedly dismissed as unrealistic. After the pro-establishment camp’s near-total rout at the recent polls, she acknowledged the people had ­indeed spoken, but seems determined to do little else. near-total rout at the recent polls Nor is Beijing in a rush to force-fix the problem. Those who have spent the past six months expecting the central government to crush the protest movement with a Tiananmen Square-style response are still waiting. Despite references in the international media to the bloody June 4 crackdown of 1989 on student protesters in Beijing, nothing of the sort has happened in Hong Kong.   State media reports and speeches by mainland Chinese officials have condemned the mayhem wrought by a radical minority and accused foreign interests of interference, reminding Hongkongers their city will always be a part of China, and urging them to be more like their Macau counterparts in making the “one country, two systems” principle work. urging them to be more like their Macau counterparts  So, after half a year of protests, the key question is, what happens if Lam and Beijing choose to ­simply stand still and continue waiting for the storm to pass?  Commentators warn of an even bigger political crisis if the ­local government fails to address the deep-rooted grievances of Hongkongers, who made their voices heard loud and clear at the ballot box last month in the ­district-level election that was more of a de facto referendum on the extent of public support for the protest movement. Executive councillor Ronny Tong Ka-wah does not expect ­Beijing or the Hong Kong government to make any major concessions to public demands any time soon. Speaking in his personal ­capacity, Tong, 69, said he expected an escalation of confrontation in society over the coming years. “There is not much hope for restoring harmony and relaunching political reform in the years to come. I expect a stalemate in Hong Kong in the next few years,” he said. “I’m resigned to the fact that I won’t see the attainment of universal suffrage in my lifetime.” Alan Leong Kah-kit, chairman of the opposition Civic Party, said Lam had squandered a golden ­opportunity to reach out during the period of relative calm around the district council elections. district council elections Instead, he said, her response since then had been “pathetic”. Spelling out the choices for Lam, he said: “You could have ­announced a commission of inquiry and after the inquiry report is published, be willing to consider amnesty for those arrested during the protests. You can also start a public engagement through the district council network on how to achieve universal suffrage.” Lam has done none of that, leaving Leong to see it as arrogance reflecting her unsuitability for the post of chief executive. Once the golden opportunity is missed, I don’t see the possibility of an amicable end to the ­current crisis Alan Leong, chairman of the opposition Civic Party “Once the golden opportunity is missed, I don’t see the possibility of an amicable end to the ­current crisis,” he said. A government-friendly businessman added that Lam was likely to stay on until the end of her term in 2022 because Beijing would find it difficult to put someone else in the hot seat before that. A Hong Kong government ­official said that while political problems might be best resolved by political means, a solution was not available at the moment. The fact of the matter, the official said, was simply this: “The government needs to continue to rely on the police to stop violence and restore order.”   Today marks exactly six months to the day since the protest movement took off on June 9. That day, Suzanne Choy joined an estimated 1 million people to protest against the extradition bill and the government’s determination to push it through the legislature despite widespread objections and concerns. an estimated 1 million people “I took part to oppose the government’s failure to heed public opinion and express my anger with the pro-establishment camp, which was adamant that they could pass any unpopular legislation with their majority in the Legislative Council,” she said. Choy, who is in her mid-40s and works in her family’s trading company, never imagined that day’s march would grow into a sweeping civil disobedience movement. “I didn’t expect the protests to turn increasingly violent or that the ensuing social unrest would have no endgame in sight,” she said, adding that she had taken part in two other peaceful rallies. Despite the inconvenience caused by the protests, I think the government is to blame for the ongoing crisis Suzanne Choy, a protester “Despite the inconvenience caused by the protests, I think the government is to blame for the ongoing crisis.” Six months on, Choy admits she is surprised by the protesters’ perseverance and tenacity. “Radical protesters’ actions, such as vandalising shops regarded as having links with Beijing, have really crossed the line,” she said, while expressing her determination to continue supporting the movement. Public opinion has never really seemed to figure in Lam’s calculations through the months of ­upheaval. She withdrew the extradition bill, but has been steadfast in rejecting the persistent calls for an independent inquiry into ­police conduct. inquiry into ­police conduct Several opinion polls indicate that most Hongkongers support an independent inquiry, but Lam has insisted on leaving all ­questions over police conduct during the protests to the ­watchdog Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC). Sources have told the Post that the government will consider setting up a commission of inquiry only if the public is dissatisfied with the IPCC report, due by early next month. The government is also in the process of setting up an independent review committee to look at the causes of the protests, similar to Britain’s response to the London riots of 2011. In September, Lam said she would invite community leaders, professionals and academics to examine society’s deep-seated problems and recommend ­solutions. But some government allies and the likes of former transport and housing minister Anthony Cheung Bing-leung have said the review committee was unlikely to satisfy those demanding an independent probe. Stephen Chiu Wing-kai, chair professor of sociology at the Education University of Hong Kong who has researched the London riots, said a review committee was no substitute for a commission of inquiry with statutory powers to conduct a full probe. Anna Wu Hung-yuk, chairwoman of the Competition Commission and a former executive councillor, said she feared there would be no real closure without an independent inquiry. “Protests will continue in the months ahead if people feel their demands for a fact-finding inquiry into police’s use of force in ­recent months are not satisfied,” she said. A source close to the government conceded that a review committee might not satisfy the demands for a commission of ­inquiry with powers to obtain all relevant information and summon witnesses. “A commission of inquiry with statutory powers is the best way to address public concern over ­alleged police brutality and look into the causes of the anti-government protests,” the source said. Hundreds of thousands joined Hong Kong’s first march approved by police since August Hundreds of thousands joined Hong Kong’s first march approved by police since August A person with knowledge of the thinking of the central and Hong Kong governments said there was also a need to take into account the police force’s firm ­resistance to holding an independent inquiry. “What happens if police officers resort to passive resistance, such as taking sick leave en ­masse?” the person asked. “If it came to that, should the People’s Liberation Army step in? Would Hong Kong people accept the PLA’s Hong Kong garrison helping to maintain law and order in such a scenario?” The Civic Party’s Leong ­dismissed the idea of a possible police strike and the PLA stepping in as “fear mongering” by government-friendly figures. If such scenarios come to pass, Hong Kong will become a police state. There is no way for Hong Kong people to back down Alan Leong, chairman of the opposition Civic Party “If such scenarios come to pass, let them happen and Hong Kong will become a police state. Hong Kong will go to ashes with the People’s Republic of China. There is no way for Hong Kong people to back down,” he said. While conducting an independent inquiry has been cemented as a core demand of the protest movement, some Beijing loyalists are more concerned about ending the violence and just want the government to put greater effort into restoring order. Ng Chau-pei, president of the pro-Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, suggested the administration hire retired judges and use government lawyers to speed up prosecutions of those arrested in connection with the protests. As of November 28, only 921 of 5,889 people arrested during ­protests have been charged. “The deterrent effect would be higher if more are brought before the courts and convicted,” Ng said. “The government should also consider invoking emergency laws to clamp down on media outlets which incite violence.” Hong Kong's PolyU siege : From beginning to end Hong Kong's PolyU siege : From beginning to end Ng said Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah, Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu and Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung should be more proactive in bringing about an end to the violence. “We wouldn’t mind if the chief executive sees the need to sack them because they fail to meet her expectations,” Ng, also a deputy to China’s top legislature, the ­National People’s Congress, said. National People’s Congress The source with knowledge of the central and Hong Kong ­governments’ thinking noted that Lam’s administration had repeatedly emphasised the need to stop the violence. “However, taking Panadol can only bring down the fever but can’t really cure the disease,” the source said. Come January, a crop of newly elected, youthful councillors will start work in a dramatically changed political landscape where opposition pan-democrats will control all but one of the city’s 18 district councils. They include people in their 20s, first-time candidates, ordinary workers and professionals who rode the tsunami of ­dissatisfaction with the government to defeat pro-establishment candidates, veteran politicians and those who held office for ­decades. The district councils are ­largely municipal bodies, with no powers to determine policy. The new councillors will have to pay attention to matters of public ­hygiene, bus services, and various other needs of residents. But with the stalemate between the protesters and Lam’s administration looking set to ­continue into the new year, there are bigger political issues at stake and the stunning results of the ­district council elections may have further repercussions. First up will be next year’s more important Legislative Council elections. Legislative Council Analysts and key figures within the pro-establishment camp expect candidates from the bloc to be punished again in the Legco polls to be held in September. Seventy seats are for the ­taking, with half of them returned by geographical constituencies. The remaining 35 seats are returned by trade-based functional constituencies. In the 2016 Legco elections, pan-democrats and localists won 30 of 70 seats and pro-establishment candidates secured 40. Opposition politicians could grab 34 seats or more in next year’s elections, according to some estimates, making it more difficult for the government to get its bills and policy initiatives passed in the legislature. The impact of the district council elections might be felt ­beyond the Legco polls, also influencing the election of Hong Kong’s next chief executive, due in 2022. The opposition’s landslide ­victory last month means it is set to take all 117 seats allotted to district councillors in the 1,200-member Election Committee that will choose the next chief executive. The camp had 326 of the 1,194 seats in the 2016 Election Committee, compared with 205 in 2011. Election Committee   The committee comprises the city’s business elite, professionals, unionists and politicians, and ­developers are represented strongly among them. Nearly 100 members of the 1,194-strong Election Committee that selected the chief executive in 2017 directly represented property developers and their business associates. This figure did not ­include those with indirect and less obvious connections with the property giants. If the pan-democrats deliver a similarly stellar performance in the Election Committee polls in 2021, it could bag a total 443 seats. Taking the seats to be grabbed by the business sector into account, the opposition could join hands with the city’s tycoons to become kingmakers in the election of the next chief executive. A candidate needs 601 votes from Election Committee ­members to secure the top job. “Beijing will only allow one candidate from the pro-establishment camp to run in the next chief executive election to minimise the risk of a pan-democratic ­contender accidentally winning the top job,” executive councillor Tong said. Each of the 2012 and 2017 chief executive elections had two candidates from the pro-establishment camp contesting the position. Two years ago, Lam ­became the chief executive after beating former financial ­secretary John Tsang Chun-wah. SCMP series | Insights into Hong Kong protests SCMP series | Insights into Hong Kong protests The source tapped into the Hong Kong and central governments’ thinking said the pan-democrats’ successive victories in various tiers of elections would force Beijing to rely more heavily on the business sector and ­tycoons. “The business sector’s bigger say would tie the government’s hands in tackling deep-rooted livelihood issues such as housing and land supply,” the source said. In September, commentaries and editorials run by mainland state media indicated Beijing’s conviction that Hong Kong’s housing crisis was largely to blame for the anti-government protests. The city’s developers owning massive land banks, including Hong Kong’s richest man Li Ka-shing, have found themselves targeted by state media. Hong Kong’s richest man Li Ka-shing They might be barking up the wrong tree, if one were to listen to the voices of protesters such as Suzanne Choy, who intends to carry on taking part in peaceful protests in future. “The reason is simple: to let Beijing and the rest of the world know what the Hong Kong ­government has been doing is ­unpopular,” she said.

In the first half of the year, a monthly average of 162,000 on-the-spot penalties were handed to motorists for illegal parking, but that figure plummeted by 55 per cent between July and October to 72,000 per month, according to police figures obtained by the Post.

Supporting roles they were taking up included clearing road blockages, escorting suspects and even delivering meals for frontline officers.  “To tackle the social unrest or to manage street traffic, which one is more important and should come first?” the insider said. “Traffic wardens, who are also under police command, patrol less often nowadays as they could become an easy target of anti-government protesters.  “They can only come out in a large group and should avoid high-risk areas such as Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui.” Protests triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill have gripped the city since June. now-withdrawn extradition bill  Radical elements of the movement, which has developed into a wider anti-government campaign, have vandalised and started fires at railway stations and universities, while also targeting businesses with links to mainland China and setting roadblocks on major thoroughfares. Police and protesters have traded blows using tear gas and petrol bombs. The number of fines for other traffic offences, such as speeding, also dropped by nearly 30 per cent to 28,000 per month between July and October, compared with 44,000 in the first six months, the police figures revealed.  Dozens of vehicles were spotted on Thursday lunchtime stopping at no-parking zones in Central, where illegal parking often causes traffic jams. They were in black spots such as Queen’s Road Central, Pottinger Street and Connaught Road Central. Several vehicles were parked up with their drivers nowhere to be seen. Hong Kong drivers escape stiffer fines for illegal parking 20 Jul 2018 Hong Kong drivers escape stiffer fines for illegal parking 20 Jul 2018 Leo Lee Man-hong, 34, a delivery van driver, who often parks in Central, said he had noticed the drop in enforcement against illegal parking during the protests, especially last month when protesters and police were locked in major clashes at Chinese and Polytechnic universities. locked in major clashes “That’s definitely related [to the protests],” he said. “Before, it was common for officers and traffic wardens to walk around checking out for parking violations … but when all officers were called on duty during the siege at PolyU, of course naturally there were fewer officers dispatched to give out tickets.” Central and Western District councillor Cheng Lai-king, from the Democratic Party, said it was taking longer for officers to deal with illegal parking, saying her complaint made at 9pm one night about two motorcycles was still not handled the following morning. World’s most expensive parking space sells for almost US$1 million in Hong Kong 23 Oct 2019 World’s most expensive parking space sells for almost US$1 million in Hong Kong 23 Oct 2019 While Cheng mostly blamed police for the parking situation, another councillor in the district, Chan Hok-fung, from the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, said protesters also had to shoulder part of the responsibility. “When so many officers are already working overtime, how do you expect them to have [enough manpower] to deal with traffic enforcement?” Chan said. A police spokesman said the force would maintain road safety in line with other commitments, deploy appropriate resources to take enforcement action, and raise road safety awareness. Fixed penalty notices allow police officers and other public officers to handle some forms of antisocial behaviour with on-the-spot penalties. Those who flout the parking regulations can expect a fine of HK$400 (US$51). Separately, police recorded around 6,900 traffic accidents per month between July and October, compared with 6,686 in each month in the first half of this year. The Transport Department told the Post around a third of the traffic lights in Hong Kong, or 730 sets, had been damaged during protests since June. It said the authority had repaired 670 of them.

Retailers could suffer at least a 15 per cent decline in revenues, the experts said, and restaurant profits could fall as much as 30 per cent. German firms committed to Hong Kong but doubt unrest will end soon 5 Dec 2019 German firms committed to Hong Kong but doubt unrest will end soon 5 Dec 2019 Tourism lawmaker Yiu Si-wing estimated the number of arrivals to Hong Kong during the Christmas holiday would drop 30 to 40 per cent, a drop he described as the steepest since the 1997 handover. “Even during Sars, the effects only took place in the first half of the year. There hasn’t ever been such a drop for Christmas,” Yiu said, referring to the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome.  Yiu said the city’s hotel occupancy rates were higher than 90 per cent at this time last year, but this year accommodation in protest zones – such as Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok – would likely be around 30 to 40 per cent. He said other areas in the city could reach 70 to 80 per cent occupancy. He said that last year a room at a three or four-star hotel could cost more than HK$1,200 (US$153), but this Christmas season prices could drop 30 to 50 per cent. Hong Kong’s anti-government protests have transformed from peaceful demonstrations into outbreaks of violence, notably in tourist, commercial and residential districts. More than 40 countries and regions have issued travel warnings or alerts about the city.  Alice Chan Cheung Lok-yee, of the Travel Industry Council, said she expected an average of 40 mainland tour groups to arrive each day in the holiday season, similar to November, because Christmas is not a holiday season for mainland visitors.  Even so, that would still be a huge drop from the same time last year when she said 277 groups visited Hong Kong on December 25 and 334 groups visited on December 26. German firms committed to Hong Kong but doubt unrest will end soon 5 Dec 2019 German firms committed to Hong Kong but doubt unrest will end soon 5 Dec 2019 A similar slump was seen in visitors from other nations, according to Paul Chan Chi-yuen, co-founder of guided-tour company Walk in Hong Kong. Chan said up to 70 per cent of bookings for individual visitors, mainly from the United States, were cancelled for Christmas and New Year. “The political unrest will subside a bit, but the situation is going to be the new normal,” he said. To boost attendance, the Ocean Park amusement attraction gave exclusive offers to residents, allowing them to buy two tickets for HK$700, almost 30 per cent below the original price. It also launched a new ride called “Wild Twister”. Lantau Island’s cable car attraction Ngong Ping 360 also lowered prices, offering a round-trip ticket for HK$30 for children, a deduction of HK$80. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort offered 15 per cent off for locals who buy three annual passes. Simon Wong Ka-wo, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said this Christmas season was the worst he had seen in over 50 years in the industry. Wong said the city’s revenues could drop 30 per cent over the holidays, compared with last year, because residents would be reluctant to dine out and less visitors would be here to spend cash. He predicted that Hong Kong’s restaurant would lose HK$3.5 billion in December. “If December continues to be this bad, I don’t know how many restaurants can survive the Lunar New Year [in January],” he said. But economist Andy Kwan Cheuk-chiu, director of ACE Centre for Business and Economic Research, said retail sales in December would not be as bad as some expected. He said sales would fall around 15 to 20 per cent compared to last year. Still, it could still be the worst year-on-year decline since 1998, he said. That year, sales dropped 17 per cent. Michael Cheng, the PwC consumer markets leader for Asia-Pacific, mainland China and Hong Kong, estimated that retail sales would drop 18 per cent in December. He said the hardest-hit sectors would be luxury goods, including jewellery, watches and electronic products. He said many major brands were slashing prices earlier than in previous years. Hong Kong’s small businesses consider backup offices in Kowloon as they look to relocate from protest hotspots 3 Dec 2019 Hong Kong’s small businesses consider backup offices in Kowloon as they look to relocate from protest hotspots 3 Dec 2019 “The direction is to take advantage of the more peaceful situation this month to strive for more business,” he said. “But the growth rate would not be huge when Hong Kong has to rely on domestic sales. Without tourists, we would suffer.” Alan Cheung Ho-lun, the 40-year-old owner of Sands Medicine Shop in Wan Chai, estimated that his December revenues would be cut in half at least. He said his shop usually made more than HK$15,000 per day during the same period last year. “I had to delay my rent payment. I really have no money. I am not joking,” Cheung said. He said mainland visitors were his main customers. Now, he must resort to selling his goods on WeChat, the online messaging platform, and mailing the products to his clients across the border. A small number of local businesses are banking on the pro-democracy movement and have benefited from sharing the political views of protesters. Charles Yip, the owner of Let’s Jam had “Lennon Walls” in his two restaurants so guests could write pro-democracy comments on Post-it stickers. He predicted that his eateries would be full during the holiday season. “Our income on normal weekends is equal to the revenue during last Christmas,” he said, adding that he was even considering opening a new branch.

The march was largely peaceful until nightfall, when some radical protesters hurled petrol bombs at the entrance of the High Court and Court of Final Appeal. That came after police confiscated weapons including knives and a Glock semi-automatic pistol in raids before the rally began. police confiscated weapons Organiser the Civil Human Rights Front estimated 800,000 people marched from Victoria Park in Causeway Bay to Chater Road in Central. Police said turnout peaked at 183,000. “The political message is clear. People are resilient and people are persistent with the five demands,” said Eric Lai Yan-ho, deputy convenor of the front, urging Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to meet their requests, which include an independent inquiry into police use of force at protests. Hundreds of thousands joined Hong Kong’s first march approved by police since August Hundreds of thousands joined Hong Kong’s first march approved by police since August  The front, which had police approval to march until 10pm, called time on the action at about 8.15pm. Its leaders said they felt pressured by the large police presence, accusing the force of intimidating participants in Central, where small stand-offs between officers and protesters occurred. The march, which commemorated UN Human Rights Day on Tuesday, came a day before the six-month anniversary of the start of the protests on June 9, when an estimated 1 million people took to the streets to decry a government extradition bill. Hong Kong’s homeless and NGOs that help them hit hard by protest crisis 8 Dec 2019 Hong Kong’s homeless and NGOs that help them hit hard by protest crisis 8 Dec 2019 The legislation has since been withdrawn, but not before the protests had sparked a citywide anti-government movement. At least 6,000 people have been arrested on suspicion of protest-related offences since the start of the unrest, during which police and radical protesters have repeatedly engaged in violent exchanges of tear gas and petrol bombs.  There have been calls for a citywide strike on Monday, with traffic disruption expected. Led by the city’s pro-democracy veterans, the head of the procession left Victoria Park at 3.15pm, holding a giant banner which read “Justice against police brutality, defend our rights”. Protesters chanted “Five demands, not one less!” and “Hongkongers, take revenge!” In the hours that followed, protesters flooded Hennessy Road, a main thoroughfare on Hong Kong Island, and Queensway after that. As the march wore on into the night, they used their smartphones to create a streaming flow of light.  Tension started to build at about 4.30pm in Central, where groups of black-clad protesters occupied a section of Des Voeux Road Central, engaging in a stand-off with riot police that continued into the evening. The force placed a water cannon and an armoured vehicle at the scene, on standby.  Participants said the large turnout showed the movement had not lost momentum, even after six months. Mr Shum, a retired civil servant, said he had been out on peaceful protests every weekend since June, and was happy to see people on the streets. “I never knew Hongkongers could be so concerned about society, and so selfless for one another. We have a generation of passionate young people. I am very thankful,” the 66-year-old said. “But at the same time I am pessimistic about the future ... because I think the central government will only tighten its grip on us. It wouldn’t let us go.” Sunday’s protests were the first for which the front had got police approval since August, the force having banned a number of others, citing safety concerns. Hours before the march, police said they had arrested 11 people and seized a 9mm semi-automatic pistol, bullets, knives and other weapons they feared could have been used to attack police officers and passers-by during the demonstrations on Sunday. The Hong Kong people have the power to continue our movement. I think we have no other way to voice our concerns. It’s our basic right Kenny Ip, data science student Many protesters, however, said they were not concerned. Causeway Bay streets were still swamped by people waiting to start the march even after the head of the procession reached the end point. Asked to comment on the attacks on court buildings, Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, the front’s convenor, distanced himself from the acts. “We are aware that the courts have been under pressure. We need to safeguard our courts. The marchers would not destroy institutions we need to safeguard,” he said. In separate statements, the city government, the Department of Justice and the police condemned the attacks, all saying that they seriously challenged the city’s rule of law. A government spokesman said: “Anyone attacking or slandering the judiciary will cause great harm to the rule of law in Hong Kong and will not be accepted by the whole society. [The government] issues its strongest condemnation.” VR game recreates immersive experience as a frontline protester VR game recreates immersive experience as a frontline protester Some protesters also vandalised shops deemed to be pro-Beijing, and sprayed slogans outside the Bank of China Tower in Central. As residents filled the streets with a sea of black, in scenes redolent of the marches which lit the fuse on the city’s political crisis half a year earlier, some protesters felt that Hongkongers had not made much progress since then. One man in his early 20s, who declined to give his name, said: “We’re just discovering more problems about the government and the police.” The student believed the movement’s tactics needed to be adjusted for a long-term fight. “What we can do is develop labour unions and the yellow economy, which are the long-term measures for the fight,” he said. The “yellow economy” refers to shops and companies deemed to be pro-democracy. Holiday season brings little cheer for embattled Hong Kong businesses 16 Dec 2019 Holiday season brings little cheer for embattled Hong Kong businesses 16 Dec 2019 A 30-year-old female protester on the march, surnamed Lam, said that, even though democrats scored a landslide victory at district council elections last month, protesters had to keep their fight going. Waving a small US flag, she said Washington’s passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act – a bill that could pave the way for diplomatic action and economic sanctions against the city’s government – had helped take the movement to the international level. “Our messages have been spread internationally and many countries are now watching the developments in Hong Kong,” the office worker said. Ian, an 11-year-old primary school pupil, was on the march with his parents. He said he had joined to push the protesters’ five demands, while his father said Hongkongers had gained unity in the past six months. “Hongkongers are more united, but the prices we are paying are much more. Many people have sacrificed,” the father said, referring to those arrested or injured. Kenny Ip, a data science student at Hang Seng University, said the protests still had momentum, despite lower turnouts during the week. “The Hong Kong people have the power to continue our movement. I think we have no other way to voice our concerns. It’s our basic right,” he said. While shopping malls had closed ahead of some previous protests, many shops in Causeway Bay continued to do business early on Sunday. By 6pm, about 60 per cent of shops along that part of the route had closed for the day, demonstrators having filled the streets. Mr Yu, 70, who runs a garment store on Canal Road, said he had continued to do business on Sunday because he believed police would not fire tear gas near his shop. Yu said that during the worst times in the past half-year his business had suffered greatly, bringing in only a few hundred dollars a week on one occasion, compared with as much as a few thousand a day usually. “I think it would be better from now on, if the extremists become more restrained and the government would also use dialogue to de-escalate the situation,” he said. In a commentary, the Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily said the letter of no objection for Sunday’s march showed the city government’s sincerity and respect for the people’s freedom of expression.

At Fortress Hill Road in Fortress Hill, police found a Glock semi-automatic pistol with five ammunition magazines, three of which were loaded. Three daggers, knives and 105 bullets were found at the location. Senior Superintendent Steve Li Kwai-wah from the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau told the press on Sunday that this was the first time a gun had been seized during the months of protest crisis. “Our firearms experts checked it and concluded that the pistol was in good condition,” he said. Li said officers also found two bulletproof vests at a location on Heard Street in Wan Chai, which police believed would be used as a meeting place for radical protesters. At Chai Wan Kok Street in Tsuen Wan, police found nine retractable batons, four bottles of pepper spray and some fire crackers, which officers said could be used to attack police stations.  Li said 75 police officers carried out the raid on Sunday morning. “Intelligence showed that the radical group had taken part in an unlawful assembly on October 20, when they used a lot of petrol bombs to attack Mong Kok Police Station,” he said. Hundreds of thousands joined Hong Kong’s first march approved by police since August Hundreds of thousands joined Hong Kong’s first march approved by police since August “Their plan is to use the gun to create chaos during the march later today, including shooting at our officers or turning the blame on officers themselves by hurting the innocent passers-by.”  Li said the police had thwarted a crisis, but added that the discovery of the weapon was evidence that people should stay alert during the march and rally, organised by the Civil Human Rights Front. Organisers vow to keep the peace at march, with police-protester diplomacy 10 Dec 2019 Organisers vow to keep the peace at march, with police-protester diplomacy 10 Dec 2019 “I hope marchers will pay attention to the situation around them,” he said. “If there’s anything wrong or dangerous, I appeal to them to leave immediately, hide in a safe place, report to the police, or inform [the front’s] marshals near them.”  He continued: “Organisers must consider public interest and safety, and stay in close contact with the police. If there is any problem, they must contact the police immediately, so that we can make appropriate response and plans.” Speaking before the march began, Civil Human Rights Front convenor Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit noted that the police had made similar seizures before previous protests. He said the front would do its best to protect marchers’ safety, such as by setting up first-aid posts. He added that, to ensure an orderly and peaceful march, police officers must also be restrained. Li said the 11 people arrested were between 20 and 63 years old, and they claimed to be students, workers or unemployed. The suspects were arrested on suspicion of possession of an unlicensed firearm, possession of dangerous goods, possession of prohibited weapons and unlawful assembly. Some of them struggled as they were arrested, according to Li. Hundreds in Hong Kong rally against use of tear gas Hundreds in Hong Kong rally against use of tear gas “We are still investigating the source of the pistol … According to my records, it was the first time that real firearms were involved in recent months,” he said. “That’s why we are concerned and hope marchers will be very careful.” Li said he would leave it to other police divisions to decide whether to ask the march organisers to change their plans. He added that the confiscated retractable batons and pepper spray bottles were different from the models used by police. “I dare not to say yet whether the suspects intended to use the items to make people suspect that they were plain-clothed officers,” he said.

But for the last two weeks in November, his customary meal was not available because of the anti-government protests and traffic disruptions across Hong Kong. Jeff Rotmeyer, the chief executive of ImpactHK, an NGO that delivers food and necessities to Hong Kong’s homeless people, knows Heng well. “He’s alone all the time and suffers from depression, but he is actually a really sweet and kind man,” Rotmeyer said. Rotmeyer and his team of 12 to 20 volunteers usually visit two or three locations across the city every night, giving out 1,500 meals each week. New Hong Kong police chief informs Beijing of ‘hard and soft’ tactics to thwart protests 7 Dec 2019 New Hong Kong police chief informs Beijing of ‘hard and soft’ tactics to thwart protests 7 Dec 2019 As the protest crisis intensified, however, the team was forced to cancel 10 per cent of their trips for two weeks as police fought pitched battles with radical protesters at local universities, including Polytechnic and Chinese University.  “Our volunteers were either too afraid or physically unable to come due to traffic disruptions,” Rotmeyer said. “But we actually saw a 25 per cent increase with people coming to our centre for food, so we had to increase our service to cope with the change.” Last week, Rotmeyer decided to move Heng into a subdivided flat in Tai Kok Tsui after he became ill and was affected by the tear gas fired during police operations. “We seldom think about how hard life is for the homeless, they are a community that is always forgotten and left behind,” Rotmeyer said. “Yes, the protests are affecting everyone in Hong Kong, but they are always suffering more.”  Since June, Hong Kong has been gripped by anti-government protests that stemmed from opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill. Radical protesters have often taken to vandalising street facilities and MTR stations. ‘I just want a safe place to live with my son’: parents share tear gas woes ‘I just want a safe place to live with my son’: parents share tear gas woes The ongoing social turmoil has hit businesses and civil society, including marginalised groups such as the elderly, disabled and the underprivileged – not to mention the many NGOs serving theses groups.  Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu said that from June until the end of October, 460 sets of traffic lights and 40 street lights were vandalised or tampered with, and 45.6km of walkway railings and about 2,900 square metres of paving blocks were removed.

The fatal accident took place at a crossing with broken traffic lights waiting for repair Teresa Lee, a social worker with the Hong Kong Society for the Blind, said damaged pavements and bricks, missing metal railings and destroyed signs had made life more difficult and dangerous for Hong Kong’s disabled population. “Many elevators and other inclusive facilities on the road and at MTR stations were damaged, leaving people with disabilities isolated and sometimes alone in their homes,” Lee said. Protests to cost government billions in tax after trashing of Legislative Council 7 Dec 2019 Protests to cost government billions in tax after trashing of Legislative Council 7 Dec 2019 “Blind people might step into a hole left by a missing brick or not know when to take a turn because their walking sticks would not touch a metal railing now.” Lee said her organisation last month had to call off all training classes for 120 blind people. The classes taught them how to use a walking stick, open doors and perform other simple tasks in their homes. The instruction also helps them avoid getting caught up in the clashes between the police and protesters. “All we could do was to make sure the disabled people living in our facilities were safe and well looked after and check up more on the needs of our service recipients living in their homes,” Lee said. A 75-year-old retiree surnamed Wong lives alone in the old neighbourhood of Sai Wan Ho. Visually impaired and suffering from constant back pain, she has struggled in the past month to get around the community to shop for groceries and go to the local community centre to read newspapers. “With traffic lights broken and not repaired for weeks, I am literally putting my life on the line every time I cross a road and compete with cars driving at high speeds. Sometimes, it’s hard to see cars coming when they take a 90-degree turn onto my road,” she said. “We have always been an afterthought in society even in normal times. We have no voice and no one cares if we can go about our business these days.” Curious visitors join walking tours to see Hong Kong protests 7 Dec 2019 Curious visitors join walking tours to see Hong Kong protests 7 Dec 2019 Money is another problem local NGOs face because of the protests. A survey released last week by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Social Enterprises found that 80 per cent of the 103 social enterprises interviewed had recorded a loss since June. About 27 per cent of the enterprises said they would lay off some staff, while 21 per cent said they would cut working hours of their employees. Chung Wai-shing, the chamber’s secretary, said many social enterprises – ranging from coffee shops and restaurants to retail businesses – employed blind, deaf and other handicapped Hongkongers. “Many enterprises are in MTR stations and universities that have become protest flashpoints,” Chung said. “With stations frequently closing and universities finishing their school terms early, many are facing a difficult time with falling revenues and high overhead costs.” 	SCMP

According to a statement issued on Saturday night by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (AmCham), its chairman Robert Grieves and president Tara Joseph were separately prevented from entering the former Portuguese colony as they travelled to the annual AmCham Macau Ball. “Both Robert and Tara were given no reason for why they were delayed,” the statement read. “After several hours, and after having to sign a statement that they voluntarily agreed not to pursue entry into Macau, they both returned to Hong Kong without any difficulty. “We are puzzled as to why this happened, given this was simply a social occasion to celebrate AmCham Macau’s annual gathering.” It added that AmCham is a business chamber and has been consistent in its support for the development of business in the Greater Bay Area. “We hope that this is just an overreaction to current events and that international business can constructively forge ahead,” it read.  The refusal comes at a sensitive time. Beijing had warned of possible retribution after the United States passed legislation in support of anti-government protests in the city. The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act could pave the way for diplomatic action and economic sanctions against the city’s government. After President Donald Trump signed the act into law last month, Beijing announced sanctions against US non-governmental organisations and human rights bodies. It did not warn of similar treatment for business chambers. Hong Kong protests: American Chamber of Commerce urges government to step up reconciliation efforts 15 Oct 2019 Hong Kong protests: American Chamber of Commerce urges government to step up reconciliation efforts 15 Oct 2019 Joseph has visited Macau at least once previously, to attend the annual ball in December 2017.  She previously said that, although AmCham supported the goal of the act in its pursuit of human rights, the legislation could adversely affect business cooperation between Hong Kong and the US.  The law will allow Washington to suspend Hong Kong’s special trading status based on an annual certification by the US State Department on whether the city still has sufficient autonomy under “one country, two systems”, the framework through which Hong Kong retains its own economic and political systems while part of China. The incident also came as Macau prepares to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its handover to China later this month. The Macau public security police force did not respond to a request for comment. Larry So Man-yum, a Macau-based commentator and former university professor, said Joseph could have been denied entry because of the chamber’s previous opposition to Hong Kong’s extradition bill. The city government’s doomed attempt to pass the bill, which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to mainland China and any jurisdiction with which Hong Kong lacks a transfer agreement, triggered months of unrest. “Although the Macau immigration authority typically would not explain its decision, the chamber has previously opposed the extradition bill,” So said. “Although it can’t be ruled out that this is linked to the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, the most important part is the chamber’s opposition to the extradition bill.” So pointed out that the Macau authority had similarly denied entry to Hong Kong pro-democracy activists. “The authority would not look into the purpose of the visit, potentially. They would only place them on a list of unwelcome persons, who would probably be perceived to have affected Macau’s local affairs.” 	SCMP

Some participants, waving miniature national flags, vented their anger at the media, shoving reporters covering the rally at Harbour Road Garden. Police said there were 1,500 people at the rally at its peak, while organisers did not give any estimate of the turnout. The rally came after the pro-establishment camp won just 60 of the 452 seats in the elections held two weeks ago, a huge drop from 292 previously. They lost control of 17 of the 18 district councils, amid civil unrest in the city. Themed “Loving the country, safeguarding Hong Kong”, the rally started with the crowd facing north and singing the national anthem. Chinese flags were distributed at the scene, turning the area into a sea of red. It was held a day ahead of a march organised by the city’s biggest pro-democracy group, the Civil Human Rights Front.  Organiser Johnny Tam Ming-kin, a non-party-affiliated property agent, said the main goal of Saturday’s rally was to demand a recount in the polls. “We hope the government can recount and show us the election results are true. Many of us feel the elections were unfair and not transparent,” Tam said. “But if they recount and the result is still the same, then we can accept that it is the pro-establishment camp who have some shortcomings and need to reflect on their strategies.”  In response, the Electoral Affairs Commission said the counting of votes had been conducted in an open and transparent environment, under public scrutiny. Its spokesman said anyone could file a petition questioning the result. Tam said he was not disappointed in the government of Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, but neither did he have any expectations from it any more.  On the stage, he claimed some ballot boxes were unlocked during the poll and some election agents failed to monitor the whole counting process. But he did not say if he had filed an official complaint with the commission. No major pro-establishment parties attended the rally, but speakers included Tang Tak-shing, chairman of the group Politihk Social Strategic, and restaurant owner and YouTuber Alex Yeung Kwun-wah, who was under investigation in Singapore after hosting a political talk. Among the participants, who were mainly middle-aged and elderly, was a 40-year-old secretary, who declined to give her name. “I am here because I feel the election results don’t make sense. After all these years of voting, it is not possible that this is the result,” she said, adding that she saw reports that observers had not been present throughout the count. “I don’t accept the results, but I think there is very little a normal citizen like myself can do.” Some of the participants were hostile towards reporters at the scene, many holding posters that read “We hate fake news”. At least six reporters from various media outlets, including pro-Beijing newspaper Ta Kung Pao, were reportedly surrounded, verbally abused, and shoved. Ta Kung Pao Protesters also surrounded a man carrying a Taiwanese flag as he walked by. One grabbed the flag and tore it off the flagpole, while others chased after the man as he tried to leave the scene. Riot police arrived to break up the scuffle, and the man escaped unscathed. When asked about the clashes with reporters, Tam said people were emotional and many did not believe all the reporters were genuine. 	SCMP

Chris Tang Ping-keung made the remarks after he and his deputy met Zhang Xiaoming, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office under the State Council. Tang was on the second day of his first official visit to Beijing since taking office last month. Chris Tang Ping-keung Tang said the top mainland official in charge of Hong Kong affairs “highly recognised” the efforts of the Hong Kong police over the past six months and would continue to support the force as it works to curb violence and restore order. “I introduced the Hong Kong situation,” Tang told the press after the meeting. “I told them that my strategy would use both hard and soft approaches. That is, we will strengthen [actions against] illegal violent acts such as the use of petrol bombs and arson.” He stressed that the tough approach had nothing to do with the potential deployment of People’s Liberation Army soldiers and that Hong Kong police were still responsible for security in the city. “But for other situations, such as protesters taking to the roads or other minor issues among youngsters, we will deal with it in a more humane and flexible way,” Tang said.  Tang also met Guo Shengkun, secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission. State news agency Xinhua reported that Guo praised Hong Kong police for doing “a lot of effective work” to maintain law and order. He said stopping violence was the first priority. “Follow the constitution and the Basic Law. We firmly support Hong Kong police in strictly enforcing the law, and fully support the force in restoring the city’s law and order,” he was quoted as saying.

Radical protesters have vandalised and torched railway stations, major roads and university campuses. They have also targeted businesses with links to the mainland. Police have so far arrested at least 6,000 people. gripped the city since June  On Friday, the first day of Tang’s visit, Minister of Public Security Zhao Kezhi pledged the central government’s “strongest support” to the Hong Kong police. He told Tang that ending the violence and restoring order were top priorities, and said he hoped that the new commissioner would lead the force with determination and uphold morale. Hong Kong police  Tang on Saturday said he briefed mainland officials about Hong Kong’s crime situation and the latest arrest figures from the protests, and introduced his new management team. Responding to a survey showing police popularity at a record low, Tang said the results were related to fake news and smear campaigns directed at the force. According to the poll by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, the police received 35.3 marks out of 100 – the lowest among all disciplinary forces – with 40 per cent of respondents giving the force zero marks. “Believing such fake news would lead to a low credibility of the force,” Tang said. “But surely we will also review whether we should be more transparent.” On the eve of Sunday’s major protest march from Victoria Park to Chater Road, Tang appealed to protesters to stay peaceful. He repeated a government statement that urged the public to remain calm and peaceful as they express their views. The government said it had “learned its lesson and will humbly listen to and accept criticism”. The statement said the Hong Kong government hoped to work with the public to restore order.

The department said the amount exceeded the legal limit. It did not say if the inspection was related to Sunday’s march. In Beijing, Tang and his delegation attended the national flag raising ceremony at Tiananmen Square on Saturday morning. Speaking to mainland media after the event, Tang said he was thrilled to see the flag waving in the breeze, and felt the strength of the country. “I was thankful for the arrangement and also the support by the country, especially the firm support to the Hong Kong police by President Xi Jinping,” he said.

Yuli Riswati, 39, was deported on December 2 following her arrest on September 23 for overstaying her visa which had expired on July 27. She was detained at Castle Peak Bay Immigration Centre (CIC) on November 4. Speaking from Indonesia in a live call to the rally at Edinburgh Place, Yuli said her “humiliating” experience at the start of her 29 days in detention had left her feeling depressed. “They told me to take off my clothes for medical examination. But I was horrified when I found out that the doctor was a man,” she said. “In Islamic beliefs, a woman’s body should not be seen by a man outside their family. But they forced me to take off my clothes. I’m a Muslim woman. It was so humiliating to do that in front of a man.” The crowd at the rally chanted “We support Yuli” as she talked, reducing Yuli to tears.  “We’re all like a family now. I hope you can also support my friends, too. Many ethnic minorities were also abused at the CIC,” she said over the phone in Cantonese. The rally called on the government to respect foreign domestic workers’ freedom of speech and right to take part in political activities.  Yuli’s supporters have accused the government of expelling her because she wrote about the civil unrest on Indonesian online news outlet Migran Pos, which she launched in March. They also questioned why authorities had to detain her for such a long period of time.  Fish Ip Pui-yu, regional coordinator of the International Domestic Workers’ Federation, said domestic workers who forget to renew their visas could ask their employers to give a written statement and a copy of their work contract to the Immigration Department. Hong Kong officials deport Indonesian domestic worker who covered protests 3 Dec 2019 Hong Kong officials deport Indonesian domestic worker who covered protests 3 Dec 2019  The Immigration Department earlier declined to comment on individual cases, but said the law gave it the power to arrest, detain, prosecute and deport anyone for violating their conditions of stay. In response to Yuli’s most recent allegations, the department once again refused to comment on her case, but stressed that any arrangements for detainees at CIC were made strictly in accordance with established procedures, to ensure fair treatment. “If any detainee is dissatisfied with the arrangement, he or she could lodge a complaint through our official complaints channel,” a spokesman said.

Hong Kong Free Tour, which takes visitors to see “the real Hong Kong”, including its poorer districts, has seen an opportunity at a time when anti-government unrest has hit the tourism industry hard. “Both locals and international travellers are welcome to join,” reads the online description for the new tours. “Please note that you are responsible for your own safety when you join this tour.” Owner Michael Tsang Chi-fai, 36, is fired up by the latest addition to the company’s offerings. Hong Kong's PolyU siege : From beginning to end Hong Kong's PolyU siege : From beginning to end “I wake up and I want to do the tour. I want to tell people, ‘This is what’s going on in Hong Kong’,” Tsang said, adding that all his tours are free to join but rely on donations. Tours to ongoing conflict zones exist elsewhere. In the West Bank, for example, visitors are taken to Israeli settlements and Palestinian refugee camps, while in eastern Ukraine, tourists can go to towns where conflicts with Russia continue.  Tsang held his first protest tour on October 4, the day the government introduced its ban on face masks. Since then, he has run three more of them, taking groups of between two and 17 to protests in Causeway Bay and Kowloon. Most people joining the tours have been tourists from the United States and Britain, although two Hongkongers came along for one at the end of October. Sense of unease hangs over Hong Kong as tension returns to city’s streets 1 Dec 2019 Sense of unease hangs over Hong Kong as tension returns to city’s streets 1 Dec 2019 On a recent Saturday, Tsang waited for his group at an exit of Tin Hau MTR station, his bright yellow shirt standing out in the sea of people dressed in black, some with gas masks dangling from their necks.  The afternoon tour would centre around Victoria Park, where protesters gathered to support pro-democracy candidates in the city’s district council elections, due on November 24.  The police had banned the rally, meaning those present could be arrested for illegal assembly. Tsang said he takes a selfie with the visitors as proof that they are in a tour if the police confront them. Two people turn up, both teachers, one British and the other American. The foreign office advised UK citizens not to get involved, but I wanted to make the most of this trip Andy Jones, British tourist As police vans sped past behind him on Hennessy Road, Tsang launched into a pre-tour talk, saying: “You might have heard a lot of things in the news, but our purpose is to walk and judge where we are in the movement.” To help the foreigners understand, he explained how the protests were triggered by the unpopular extradition bill which many feared would lead to fugitives being sent to mainland China, among other jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no exchange arrangement. Andy Jones, a geography teacher from Birmingham, said he was curious about the protests, but did not know where to find them, or even when they would take place.   “The foreign office advised UK citizens not to get involved, but I wanted to make the most of this trip,” Jones said, adding that he heard about the protests while in the UK, and wanted to see them for himself. Sarah Severance, 32, an American teaching English in China, said the steady escalation in violence over the past months had not deterred her from experiencing a Hong Kong protest first-hand. “I feel it’s even more important now to see what’s happening,” she said. The tour continued into the park’s soccer field, where protesters heaved a goal frame to use as a barricade. Police stood outside the park, a black flag warning they would use tear gas to disperse the crowd. As demonstrators crowded the streets outside the park, police started firing tear gas. Protesters ran across Victoria Park and jumped over fences, heading to Tin Hau station. “I’ve never been tear-gassed before,” Jones said. “I can feel it in my eyes, throat, and on my skin.” He was surprised police had fired tear gas when they did. “It seemed really peaceful and there were so many people,” he said. Severance, who was on her first visit to Hong Kong, said the protest experience did not put her off returning. Tsang said it was the first time his protest tour ended with tear gas. “There’s always a possibility that this will happen,” he said. Although everyone was safe, he added that he was considering starting future tours earlier, and making the risks clear to guests. Told about Tsang’s protest tours, tourism sector lawmaker Yiu Si-wing, director at China Travel Service, did not like the idea. “No one can guarantee what will happen at the scene of protests,” he said, citing the example of a Japanese tourist beaten by protesters for taking photos in Mong Kok. Fixing trashed CityU campus will cost ‘hundreds of millions of dollars’ 30 Nov 2019 Fixing trashed CityU campus will cost ‘hundreds of millions of dollars’ 30 Nov 2019 He also said that professional insurance does not cover tour guides who take tourists to such sites. Hong Kong’s Tourism Commission, which develops tourism strategies for the city, said in a statement that guides are expected to inform their customers of any potential risks. Simon Yu, owner of the Hop Inn in Tsim Sha Tsui, said that before he knew about Tsang’s tours, he advised hostel guests keen to see the protests to stay away from any possible unrest. He has since referred guests to Tsang. “At the beginning, I was a bit worried when he took guests there,” he said. “But he is a very responsible guy and very passionate about what he does.” Terry Stevens, an expert on political tourism based in the UK, cautioned that protest tours run the risk of becoming voyeuristic without careful planning and support. “It’s almost like watching a football match, two sides of supporters having a go at each other,” he said, adding that understanding the context of unrest and listening to both sides are necessary. Tsang, a licensed tour guide, said the main objective of his protest tour, as with the other tours he runs, is to show visitors another side of Hong Kong. He said visitors read the news about people beating each other up, about vandalism, and about the city not being safe. “I really want to have them feel for themselves if it’s safe or not,” he said.

Anthony Neoh, chairman of the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC), said the five-member panel, which his body appointed, had overstepped its function and might lack an understanding of the city. The experts group, led by Denis O’Connor, the former British chief inspector of constabulary, said in November that the IPCC did not have the investigative capabilities to look into disturbances on such a scale, and should be empowered to subpoena documents and summon witnesses. said in November that the IPCC did not have the investigative capabilities to look into disturbances on such a scale Speaking in a mainland media interview released on Saturday, Neoh said: “They do not really understand our situation, so their proposal has overstepped our statutory function.” “So I’ve told them, thank you for your suggestions, but we have to follow the law,” he told Shenzhen Satellite TV. Neither Neoh nor O’Connor immediately returned requests for comment. Hong Kong police watchdog ‘lacks power’ to probe force conduct during protests 11 Nov 2019 Hong Kong police watchdog ‘lacks power’ to probe force conduct during protests 11 Nov 2019 Neoh previously said the IPCC’s investigatory powers could be expanded in the long term, but added that the priority was to hire more solicitors and barristers to assist it.  As well as O’Connor, the rest of the panel comprised former or current heads of police watchdogs in Canada, New Zealand and Australia, and a British scholar on crowd behaviour. Hundreds in Hong Kong rally against use of tear gas Hundreds in Hong Kong rally against use of tear gas The current investigation focuses on six key dates – protests on June 9 and 12, July 1, August 1 and 31, and an attack on protesters and other passengers at Yuen Long railway station on July 21. It is expected to also look into the use of San Uk Ling Holding Centre, where officers have been accused of mistreating arrested protesters. It was understood that the preliminary report could be submitted to Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor by the end of December, with a view to publishing it in late January or early February 2020.  Despite Neoh’s remarks, the IPCC had yet to formally decide on the panel’s suggestions, according to two vice-chairmen, Christopher Cheung Wah-fung and Frankie Yick Chi-ming.  Yick said he was open to giving the IPCC investigatory powers. ‘I just want a safe place to live with my son’: parents share tear gas woes 10 Dec 2019 ‘I just want a safe place to live with my son’: parents share tear gas woes 10 Dec 2019 “Society should have a discussion on whether the IPCC should be given the power. If that’s agreed upon, then the government should revise the law,” Yick said. But he asked whether such powers would mean “all the problems are solved”, citing the Ombudsman, a government watchdog, and saying that even with investigatory powers, it does not necessarily effect change at government departments. Cheung, however, attacked the panel. He said its members did not understand the work of the IPCC, and said the governing council reserved the right to only accept part of recommendations. If any committee or investigation is to target police or blow the force’s enforcement power, this is unjust Commissioner of Police Chris Tang “Our work is to review complaints handled by the Complaints Against Police Office and determine whether that is open and transparent ... we will not investigate the police ourselves. That’s not our job,” Cheung said. Speaking in Beijing, Commissioner of Police Chris Tang Ping-keung said the IPCC should conduct any investigation into the force, as its members were experienced. He added that he understood the separate review committee previously announced by Lam was to look into the reasons behind the social unrest, rather than police specifically. “If any committee or investigation is to target police or blow the force’s enforcement power, this is unjust,” he said. “I also note that many people wish to achieve a certain investigation result they long for by setting up different committees. If the result failed to match their expectations, they would object to it as well. So I think any committee is meaningless in that sense.” 	SCMP

Ho was described as a “patriot” in a press release from the China University of Political Science and Law, while the state-run tabloid Global Times said the lawyer was given the degree to “recognise his outstanding contribution and achievements in the legal sector”. Global Times Friday’s ceremony came after Anglia Ruskin University revoked Ho’s honorary doctorate in October after complaints by local pro-democracy supporters and David Alton, who sits in the UK’s House of Lords. The complaints centred on Ho shaking hands with members of a group allegedly linked to an indiscriminate attack on train passengers and anti-government protesters at Yuen Long railway station in July. Ho has denied any prior knowledge of the attack. About 100 men in white T-shirts wounded at least 45 people with wooden canes and metal rods during the incident on July 21. The British university’s decision sparked fierce criticism in Beijing, with state broadcaster CCTV issuing an online commentary headlined, “It is an honour for Junius Ho to be stripped of his honorary doctorate”.  In attacking Anglia Ruskin University, the writer said: “I suggest the mainland universities grant Mr Ho an honorary doctorate, and let the British university see that patriotism is the highest honour of our Chinese!”  Lawmaker Junius Ho calls on Hong Kong police to arrest five opposition legislators 2 Aug 2019 Lawmaker Junius Ho calls on Hong Kong police to arrest five opposition legislators 2 Aug 2019 Ho, speaking on Saturday with mainland media, said he hoped his award could act as a “morale boost” for “patriots” in Hong Kong amid the ongoing chaos.  The reaction to Ho receiving the honour was split.  Mainland internet users wrote congratulations on Ho’s account on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, some leaving messages calling the lawmaker “a pride of China”, while others said “our country would not allow our patriots to be aggrieved”. In contrast, online users in Hong Kong mocked the “compensation” on the LIHKG platform. “Is there any difference from rubbing salt into his wound?” one user wrote, while another added: “It just shows a mainland certificate has no more legitimacy than trash.” According to the official webpage of the China University of Political Science and Law, Hong Kong’s former secretary for justice Elsie Leung Oi-sie and the late rural kingpin Lau Wong-fat were also awarded honorary doctorates. Ho earlier claimed he was blindsided by the decision by his British alma mater, but a university letter obtained by the Post showed he was personally informed on October 28 when it rescinded the award, and was warned two years ago by the university he could be stripped of his honorary doctorate amid concerns over statements he had made. Post warned two years ago The lawmaker drew condemnation from across the political spectrum when he told a public rally in September 2017 that advocates of Hong Kong independence should be “killed mercilessly”. Police investigated the remarks but declined to press charges the following April, citing a lack of evidence. 	SCMP

The pair are two of the many Yau Tsim Mong district residents whose lives have been affected by the police’s use of tear gas to disperse anti-government protests in the area last month. The mother, who only wanted to be known as Ko, spoke at a press conference on Saturday along with two other affected residents. “I was sleeping when the smell of tear gas leaked into my flat through the air conditioning. I could not breathe and my chest hurt. After that, I took my son and left, to my hometown in China,” Ko said. “I just want a safe place to live with my son,” Ko said, breaking down in tears as she spoke. She said she left on November 13 after a series of weekday protests starting on November 11 crippled transport and businesses across the city. Clashes between anti-government protesters and police led to tear gas being fired in various districts, including Mong Kok. Since then, Ko has moved four times, including to a friend’s house in Tuen Mun. “I had to travel so far to get to my son’s school in Mong Kok. In the end, he was late. He is very unhappy these days, and his rashes make him itch all night,” she said.  Her son’s rashes appeared soon after the tear gas entered her flat on Sai Yeung Choi Street South, which runs parallel to Nathan Road, where clashes often broke out with police firing round of the smoky irritant to clear protesters who blocked traffic and threw petrol bombs and other projectiles at them. The protests, triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill and since broadened into an anti-government movement, are approaching the six-month mark. Hundreds in Hong Kong rally against use of tear gas Hundreds in Hong Kong rally against use of tear gas Ko said neither Western nor traditional Chinese doctors could cure her son, and the lingering tear gas smell in her flat meant she could not return to move her belongings. She continues to pay rent, but hopes she will be given compensation to move out.  Ko is unemployed as she has to take care of her son, and relies on the government’s Comprehensive Social Security Assistance scheme, which covers her rent and other expenses.  Derek Chu Kong-wai, the newly elected district councillor for Mong Kok South, said he and other pan-democrat councillors had managed to secure temporary housing for Ko, and would seek to meet housing and welfare officials to discuss her case soon. Another incoming district councillor, Lee Kwok-kuen from the Tai Nan area in Yau Tsim Mong district, said pan-democrats from his district had agreed to set up a working group to help more residents affected by tear gas.

Another resident at the press conference was a parent who identified himself as Cheung. He said the use of tear gas around the Yau Ma Tei wholesale fruit market, near his son’s school, was very concerning. “I dressed him in long sleeves and told him not to touch anything in school,” he said. It is not enough to just release information. The government must also compensate affected residents Suzanne Wu, district councillor-elect He added the school had only asked its own cleaners to clean the facilities and his son, who is in Primary Five, said five of his classmates had upset stomachs after returning to class. Another newly elected Community March councillor, Suzanne Wu Sui-shan of Yau Ma Tei South, said the Education Bureau needed to hire professional cleaners to handle tear gas residue as well as providing proper protection for contract cleaners. The three district councillors-elect called on the government to release information on the components of tear gas, echoing earlier calls from lawmakers and environmental groups. “And it is not enough to just release information. The government must also compensate affected residents,” Chu said. 	SCMP

Paul Chan Mo-po said on Saturday it was too early to say whether the deficits would persist in the longer term as he revealed the anti-government protests – estimated to have cost the city 2 percentage points in gross domestic product – were hitting the economy far harder than external factors. Expressing concern over the impact of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, Chan said some top international universities were already hesitant to work with local institutions after the legislation that could pave the way for diplomatic action and economic sanctions against the city’s government was passed last month in the United States.

Finance chief Paul Chan warns of deficit as government boosts relief spending 30 Sep 2019 Finance chief Paul Chan warns of deficit as government boosts relief spending 30 Sep 2019 The decline in business performance has prompted the government to roll out more than HK$25 billion (US$3.2 billion) worth of relief measures, with the latest round announced on Wednesday. It also downgraded on Monday its forecast for this year’s budget from a surplus of HK$16.8 billion to a deficit, with public spending in Hong Kong rising above income for the first time in 15 years.  Facing increasing levels of government spending, Chan’s forecast for the budgets of 2019-20 and 2020-21 were pessimistic. “It’s unavoidable that this year’s budget will be in the red. We also think it’s unavoidable to have a budget deficit in the next 2020-21 financial year,” he told a radio programme.  But Chan said there was no need to worry if the deficit figure only amounted to 2 to 3 per cent of GDP.  “It’s too early to say Hong Kong society has entered a structural deficit,” he said, referring to the phenomenon of persistent annual budget deficits. He said the government could explore new sources of income in the future, allowing it to be cautious about dipping into its reserves.  He said the effect of the official scheme last year to dish out up to HK$4,000 for those who did not benefit from the budget was “not ideal”.

On the signing of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act into law by Donald Trump, Chan raised fears about its impact on the city’s innovation and technology development. signing of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act into law Though it would not have an immediate effect, it would mean the city was beholden to US legislation, he said. The law will allow Washington to suspend Hong Kong’s special trading status based on an annual certification by the US State Department on whether the city still has sufficient autonomy under “one country, two systems”, the framework under which Hong Kong retains its own economic and political systems while part of China. The act will also give the State Department the discretion to sanction people deemed responsible for acts that undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy from mainland China, and directs its officers not to deny visas to individuals subjected to “politically motivated” arrests or detention in the city. Hundreds gather in Hong Kong to thank Trump for signing human rights act 1 Dec 2019 Hundreds gather in Hong Kong to thank Trump for signing human rights act 1 Dec 2019 “In the short term, the confidence from the international community towards Hong Kong’s investment environment will be affected,” Chan said. He said Hong Kong was a relative latecomer to the fields of innovation and technology and questioned whether international institutions would continue to be drawn to the city in the same way, and how easily research equipment could still be imported. Without naming any schools, Chan said on Saturday: “We have mentioned that there were top universities in the United States and Britain who have expressed an interest in working with various local tertiary institutions. For now, some were hesitant.” In 2018, HK$10 billion was earmarked for world-renowned research institutes to conduct biotechnology, AI and robotics research and development projects in Hong Kong through partnerships with local institutions.

He added international talent would be forced to consider the convenience of equipment delivery and the US government’s attitude towards them if they did research in the city. On a brighter note, commerce minister Edward Yau Tang-wah felt the US-China trade war negotiations had lingered for more than a year and there was no reason for Washington to further raise its tariffs. He believed the situation would not get any worse and there was hope for the future. 	SCMP

Muscular men are commanding a premium, earning as much as HK$2,000 (US$255) a day to be assigned to locations at risk of violence by anti-government protesters. The normal daily rate is HK$700 to HK$800. anti-government protesters The security sector has emerged as one of the few winners in Hong Kong despite the economic downturn, after nearly six months of anti-government protests have resulted in severe damage and vandalism at MTR stations, businesses, banks, shopping centres and universities. Several security firms told the Post there has been a sharp rise in demand for security guards, and many firms have increased their manpower. Post One firm’s general manager, who preferred to remain anonymous, said South Asian men with sturdy builds had become especially sought after to work on university campuses. “Many high-risk corporations such as the MTR and Airport Authority have already employed South Asian security guards, as some of them have worked as bouncers at nightclubs or pubs,” he said.  He said some universities had asked specifically for South Asians, but the firm had none left to deploy.

A Baptist University source said the university had also hired some South Asian security staff.  The manager said a security guard built like a bouncer could command as much as HK$2,000 a day. Normal full-time guards earn just over HK$17,000 per month.  “Our firm used to employ more than 1,000 security officers. Now we need to provide an extra 200 part-timers for some protest days,” he said. Andy Choi, chief executive officer of security firm IWS Group Holdings, said his firm had doubled its security manpower with an extra 2,000 part-timers. His clients include big corporations such as the MTR, Chinese firms and several government departments such as the immigration and transport departments.

King Lam, general manager for City Security, whose clients include Baptist University, said his firm did not source security staff from nightclubs or pubs. “We conduct our own recruitment exercise and we’ll weigh our applicants in accordance with the job requirements, their past experience, abilities and skills,” he said.

Before the protests broke out in June, she used to work about six days a week, earning at least HK$12,000 per month. Her income has dried up to slightly over HK$3,000 a month. In October and November, she worked a total of only 10 days. “Local people are simply not in the mood for travelling,” she says. “With the social unrest, people are also being prudent with their spending as they don’t know what will happen.” Married to a construction worker, she has had to dip into her savings to contribute her share of their HK$12,000 monthly mortgage payment. The couple do not have children, but she supports her 80-year-old mother. Months of violent protests sparked in June by the now-withdrawn extradition bill have taken a heavy toll on the economy, labour and welfare chief Law Chi-kwong has said. now-withdrawn extradition bill Radical protesters have vandalised railway stations and blocked roads, disrupting travel, and trashed shops and other businesses with links to mainland China. trashed shops The strong anti-mainland sentiment of the protests has been keeping Chinese visitors away. Hit by the downturn, some travel agencies, restaurants and retailers have closed for good while other struggling firms have asked staff to go on unpaid leave or cut their working hours. Those out of work and struggling to make ends meet have been out looking for part-time work. Travel guide Chau says she has scrambled to hunt for part-time jobs and grabbed part-time sales work paying about HK$90 per hour. “But these jobs are unstable,” she says, revealing that her monthly expenses amount to about HK$15,000. Aside from the HK$1,900 rent for her public housing flat, she has instalment payments to keep up for household appliances. I am really upset with what’s happened in Hong Kong. It seems now the mutual trust between people has gone Zoe Pang, tour guide “My daughter needs money for her education while my elderly parents, in their 70s, need to see the doctor from time to time. I need to pay their medical bills,” she says. She has tightened her belt by not eating out, borrowed from the bank and has asked relatives on the mainland for help. “I don’t know when this kind of life will end,” Chau says with a sigh. Pang, too, has taken any part-time work she can get, at convenience stores, the MTR, and even as a security guard at a car park. “But these jobs can’t help much as the income is just about HK$1,000 or HK$2,000 per month,” she says. She has no idea what the future holds. If all else fails, she will switch to being a security guard.

Being a security guard is the last thing I want to do,” Pang says. “I am really upset with what’s happened in Hong Kong. It seems now the mutual trust between people has gone.” Betty Ho, 48, a full-time saleswoman who earned about HK$20,000 a month selling hair care products, was told to go on three months’ leave without pay from October. Her boss told her and two other full-time employees that the company had been hit by the social unrest. “I was so frightened because I earned very little and I don’t have any spare cash,” says Ho, who is single and supports her septuagenarian mother. She looked for part-time jobs and managed to get a temporary position as a saleswoman at Sogo department store in Causeway Bay for its “Thankful Week” sales from November 18 to 24. Not a single day passes by without me worrying. I panic at the thought that my hair care firm will close down and I’ll be out of work. What can I do about my future? Betty Ho, saleswoman “I was paid on a daily basis, but on a couple of days the store was forced to shut down totally or cut short its opening hours because of protests,” she says. Ho has since taken another part-time job in a supermarket, earning half her usual pay. “Not a single day passes by without me worrying,” she says. “I panic at the thought that my hair care firm will close down and I’ll be out of work. What can I do about my future?” Dining industry leader David Leung Chi-wai, chairman of the Seafood Delight Group, says many restaurants have closed down, while others have cut staff or forced employees to take unpaid leave as they struggle to stay afloat. He says the industry union estimates about 300 restaurants have shut down across the city, putting 12,000 out of work. The sector employs about 300,000 people. “The dining industry has been badly affected by the social unrest,” he says. “In a single week, one dining group received cancellations for 2,000 tables at wedding banquets as their clients did not want their dinners to clash with protest days.” He says there were not many job opportunities for unemployed people from the sector and when a restaurant goes bust, everyone is affected. “The restaurant bosses usually fly to the mainland to escape debts,” he says. “Other staff like waiters or waitresses may be able to find jobs in other sectors, especially part-time jobs. But for kitchen staff, especially chefs, it is very difficult to find work.” 	SCMP

The results came after the British Home Office was reportedly blocked by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab from introducing an initiative to grant further rights to these Hongkongers. Calls for BN (O)-holding Hongkongers to be given the right of abode have been rising in Britain as the city sees increasing violence from protesters and police after anti-government protests broke out in June. “The British public have sent a clear message that it is time for us to step up and do our duty by extending right of abode to BN (O) passport holders,” said Johnny Patterson, director of the British-based Hong Kong Watch group, which commissioned the survey along with Friends of Hong Kong. Why some Hongkongers are taking a fresh look at their British National (Overseas) passports Why some Hongkongers are taking a fresh look at their British National (Overseas) passports The survey found that only one in five people opposed granting the right of abode to all BN (O) passport holders, while 45 per cent supported the idea. The support rate was even higher – at 49 per cent – for those aged over 55, a segment of the population with more vivid memories of the former British colony’s 1997 handover to China.  Against the backdrop of Brexit, more than 40 per cent of respondents say London should make it easier for BN (O) holders than for EU citizens to live and work in Britain. Some 48 per cent say Britain bears a “moral duty” to do right by Hongkongers, according to London-based research firm Savanta ComRes’s survey of 2,041 people this week.  Up to 248,000 Hongkongers hold a BN (O) passport, a travel document that does not confer an automatic right to live or work in Britain. It was issued to those born before the handover.   Raab in September told the British Parliament that any changes to the status of BN (O) passport holders risked violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration.  The treaty signed by the two governments in 1984 stipulated that China’s basic policies regarding Hong Kong would remain unchanged for 50 years and included a promise that the city would retain a high degree of autonomy. UK Hongkongers make BN (O) passports an election issue for Raab 2 Dec 2019 UK Hongkongers make BN (O) passports an election issue for Raab 2 Dec 2019 But according to British media reports this week, Home Secretary Priti Patel’s team proposed a “quick fix” to help those seeking to escape Hong Kong. Raab reportedly objected to Patel’s proposal on the grounds it could anger Beijing and disrupt the “one country, two systems” policy for governing Hong Kong. The Foreign Office described the report as a “wrong story”, adding that Raab was coordinating what it called “cross-Whitehall contingency planning in relation to Hong Kong”. 	SCMP

The meetings came after two recent incidents, both at Richmond Secondary School. One is believed to have involved a fight between pupils, a description of which was shared on social media, while the other related to an anonymous letter praising the Communist Party that was attached to the locker of a pupil who apparently supported the Hong Kong protests. “This letter isn’t to scare or threaten you, we just want to teach you about history and let you know the consequences,” said the lengthy letter in Chinese, which said Hongkongers were “disgraceful and cowardly”, and protest supporters “evil”.

A copy of the letter was sent to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation by someone it said was a friend of the locker’s owner, who was in the eighth grade and had decorated it with paraphernalia supporting the Hong Kong protest movement. The same letter had been shared on Twitter by writer Henry Lam, days earlier.  Provided with descriptions of the incidents and a copy of the letter, David Sadler, spokesman for the Richmond School District, said on Thursday that the two incidents involved different students. He provided no further details about the incidents, but confirmed the meetings about them. Supporters and opponents of the Hong Kong protest movement have clashed in Richmond, British Columbia.

The event at Edinburgh Place in Central was held even though officials had repeatedly dismissed fears that tear gas was toxic, with welfare minister Law Chi-kwong saying the level of carcinogenic dioxins resulting from a police crowd-control weapon was minimal compared with that released from barbecue activities. On stage, masked members of the so-called Citizens’ Press Conference, a self-styled representative group of protesters, said they had interviewed 17,000 people who were exposed to the smoke, with up to 23 per cent claiming they suffered breathing problems, watery eyes and skin irritation for a prolonged period. Another 16 per cent experienced abnormal diarrhoea, three times the figure from data obtained overseas. “It proves that tear gas is toxic and poses great health risks,” one representative alleged, adding that about 5.5 per cent of respondents said they had coughed up blood and had discoloured urine. Among the speakers was Dr Arisina Ma, president of the Hong Kong Public Doctors’ Association, who slammed police for firing tear gas frequently in dense areas in a short time, as the smoke could irritate the skin and nervous system, resulting in an allergy.  “Officers also shot the smoke at short-range and from height … It could cause a stampede,” Ma said. “The smoke could cause pulmonary oedema [excess fluid in the lungs], which is fatal.” Filipino dancer arrested for joining illegal assembly wins legal costs bid 6 Dec 2019 Filipino dancer arrested for joining illegal assembly wins legal costs bid 6 Dec 2019 But she did not know if the tear gas contained cyanide and dioxin, and demanded the government disclose the ingredients. “City in tears. People in fear,” the organisers led the crowds in chanting. They called on the government to address the public’s concerns and disclose the ingredients of the irritants.  In a video played at the rally, a black-clad frontline protester said she suffered from diarrhoea for three to four days almost every time she was exposed to the smoke.  “After police switched to using canisters made in mainland China, I once coughed up blood,” she said, showing a photo of blood on a tissue. She claimed her menstrual cycle was also disrupted with the blood discharged being a black colour. The organisers estimated the turnout as near 20,000. Police put the figure at 600 at the rally’s peak. In the crowd was a man in his 50s holding a placard saying: “Save our next generation. No more tear gas.” Declining to give his name, he criticised police for firing tear gas in neighbourhoods and affecting residents living in flats above the streets. “Why can’t the government disclose the ingredients? It is also unfair to frontline police. They are also subjected to harmful effects,” he said.

But the government and the force refuse to reveal the chemical content of the gas, citing security and operational reasons. Senior Superintendent Kelvin Kong Wing-cheung from the police public relations branch said at a press conference on Friday that the force had not used any ammunition since Monday. “It proves police do not need any ammunition if there are no mobs or violence,” Kong said. He had previously said police had no choice at which locations they fired tear gas as it depended on where mobs were rampaging.

Pressure is mounting on British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to come out more strongly in support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong and take a clearer line on China and human rights. anti-government protesters in Hong Kong The calls for a more assertive stance of support came at a meeting held by the Labour-affiliated Fabian Society, Britain’s oldest think tank, in London this week. Britain The meeting was addressed by Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong, who spoke via video link after a court in the city banned him from travelling to London. It was also attended by Simon Cheng, the former employee of the British consulate in Hong Kong who alleges he was tortured in China. Joshua Wong who alleges he was tortured in China It’s very important that the Labour Party don’t just see China as a trading opportunity Labour peer Charles Falconer “We are very conscious of the importance of international support for democracy in Hong Kong and it’s very important that the Labour Party don’t just see China as a trading opportunity,” the Labour peer Charles Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton and a former lord chancellor, who chaired the meeting, told the South China Morning Post.

You should not buy the [Communist Party] line that that is what it is. The degree of repression is huge,” he said. Falconer was referring to some on the left of the Labour Party who suspect the “black hand” of the United States and British government of stirring up the protests. United States  Corbyn has said little about his foreign policy plans should he win the December 12 general election, and even less on China, leading to accusations from some quarters that he is too soft on authoritarian governments. Earlier this year Corbyn came under fire for snubbing US President Donald Trump when he came to Britain, after the Labour leader had attended a private meeting with Xi Jinping when the Chinese president visited in 2015. Donald Trump Xi Jinping Chinese for Labour activist Stephen Ng told the Fabian Society meeting that for too long Sino-Anglo business interests had taken priority over democracy and human rights issues. human rights  “Imperialism is all the same, whether Chinese or British,” he said.  At a panel on the foreign policy of the different political parties held last month at British foreign policy think tank Chatham House, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said she agreed with the last British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, that the British government “has been utterly craven in its attitude to China and Hong Kong”. agreed with the last British governor of Hong Kong “We rightly worry about democracy in Hong Kong and religious persecution on the mainland but China has shown the capacity for change before, on issues like climate change and many others,” she said. “We must now influence it to take the lead on the issue of human rights.” Corbyn says he will ‘remain neutral’ in new Brexit vote if made PM 23 Nov 2019 Corbyn says he will ‘remain neutral’ in new Brexit vote if made PM 23 Nov 2019 China has repeatedly criticised foreign interference in the domestic issue of Hong Kong, which has been gripped by six months of social unrest. Mass demonstrations against a now-withdrawn extradition bill have since morphed into a wider anti-government movement. China has repeatedly criticised foreign interference Beijing has also rejected Western criticism of the large facilities it has built in Xinjiang, where nearly 1 million Uygurs have reportedly been detained. It calls the facilities “vocational training centres” and says they help tackle extremism. Xinjiang “China has featured briefly in Labour’s election campaign with a section in its manifesto noting that the ‘Uygurs in China have been met with total inaction and apathy by the current UK government’ – leading to an implicit suggestion that a Corbyn government would be more assertive,” said Chris Ogden, associate professor in Asian security at the University of St Andrews’ School of International Relations. Thousands of protesters return to Hong Kong streets to reiterate five demands to government Thousands of protesters return to Hong Kong streets to reiterate five demands to government “That stated, any new government in the post-Brexit climate will be looking to secure new global trade deals, with China being a much-prized trading partner. As such, we can expect a Corbyn government – just like a Johnson one – to mute its criticism of China so as to not antagonise Beijing and to maximise the possibility of securing a long-term free trade deal.” post-Brexit Labour MP Catherine West, a strong supporter of the Hong Kong protesters, said the party had pledged £400 million (US$525 million) to promote human rights around the world through its foreign office that “would allow ministers to underline human rights concerns in bilateral meetings”. Other observers said there were signals that a Corbyn government would “kowtow to Beijing”. “Here is a man who wants to be prime minister and he has nothing to say about China as a world force, UK-China relations, Chinese technology and other sensitive investments in the UK, Chinese repression of minorities, human rights, trade unions and so on,” said the economist George Magnus, a research associate at Oxford University’s China Centre, and a critic of both Corbyn and China.

Europe Just last month, Jingye Group announced it was buying British Steel. The rescue deal for the collapsed steelmaker involves the Chinese conglomerate paying about £50 million and saving 4,000 jobs, mostly at its main plant in Scunthorpe in the north of England.

Kowloon City Court ruled in favour of dancer Jethro Santiago Pioquinto, 36, who cleared his name after the Department of Justice could not prove he had taken part in an unlawful assembly in Mong Kok on August 3. Pioquinto, who was arrested 600 metres from his home at the junction of Nathan Road and Fife Street, was among five defendants who had protest-related charges dropped because of insufficient evidence. He was the third to successfully apply for costs of the legal proceedings, after the court ruled he had been apprehended by police even though he had not acted suspiciously. The court heard that on the night in question, more than 100 protesters had gathered on Nathan Road and confronted riot police who formed a cordon at the junction of Argyle Street – one block south of where Pioquinto was. He was arrested after officers conducted a sweep and marched north along Nathan Road. At Friday’s hearing, acting Principal Magistrate Ada Yim Shun-yee made the quick decision to allow Pioquinto’s application without hearing from the prosecution, after she was told police had arrested the defendant despite knowing he lived nearby and carried nothing suspicious.  “The address of the defendant was already known to police, and the defendant had already provided an innocent excuse under caution,” Yim said. “Nothing suspicious was found on him, and he was arrested relatively far from the gathering point of the unlawful assembly.”  Pioquinto’s lawyer Fiona Nam Hoi-yan said her client had spent more than HK$30,000 (US$3,846) on the four court hearings connected to the case.  Photographer Lee Wing-ho, 22, a co-defendant of Pioquinto, also had his charge withdrawn but he did not apply for costs. Nothing suspicious was found on the defendant, and he was arrested relatively far from the gathering point of the unlawful assembly Ada Yim, principal magistrate In a separate case, however, Yim turned down a similar application from bank clerk Leung Hei-wing, 24, whose charge of participating in an unlawful assembly at the junction of Nathan Road and Argyle Street on the same day as the pair was also dropped earlier. Yim ruled that Leung had drawn suspicion upon herself by appearing in the centre of Nathan Road carrying three respirators and a mask. Leung’s lawyer Andrew Lau argued that the reason she sat in the middle of Mong Kok’s main carriageway remained in doubt, as it was a few steps from an MTR station exit and she might just have walked past the scene. But Yim dismissed the claim, saying it was impossible to enter the area without pushing through a big crowd, which was dispersing towards both sides of the road after police started their sweep. “Even if she did enter the area successfully, why would she have to do that? That wasn’t a tourist spot, or a place to shop or her way home,” she said. 	SCMP

Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po on Wednesday unveiled a fourth wave of relief measures to help small and medium-sized enterprises cope, as the economy reels from the double whammy of the Hong Kong protests and the US-China trade war. Paul Chan Mo-po fourth wave of relief measures Under the nearly HK$4 billion (US$512 million) package, the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal would enjoy six months of relief, in which government rents for tenants, as well as docking and passenger fees for cruise lines, would drop by 34 per cent. The plan, which would benefit six tenants and 105 ships calling on the terminal during the six-month period, was met with a cool response by the companies.   Dream Cruises, one of the cruise lines at the terminal, said it was hoping for a longer-term approach by the government.  “As the only cruise company with a year-round home port deployment in Hong Kong, we look forward to further relief measures that would provide sustainable support over the full-year period,” said a spokeswoman. She did not elaborate further.

Demonstrations have frequently descended into chaos, with radical protesters hurling petrol bombs or bricks at riot police.

Police officers have also fired tear gas, pepper spray, and even live rounds at protesters. Federal’s banquet restaurant, usually the top earner among its three restaurants, had seen many event cancellations, such as weddings and annual dinners in the past few months, Tam said. “Now is supposed to be the peak season for banquets,” he said. “When we miss the busy season, how are we supposed to compensate for the losses arising in the low season?

Built on the runway of the city’s former Kai Tak Airport, the HK$6.6 billion Kai Tak Cruise Terminal has a floor area of almost 2 million square feet – similar to the size of Victoria Park in Causeway Bay. Kai Tak Airport Since the debut of the three-storey terminal in 2013, critics have called it a “white elephant” and a “ghost island” with poor transport links. Two cruise lines call the terminal their home port, including one seasonally. As of December 6, a total of 182 cruise liners had arrived at the cruise terminal this year. Last year the number was 170, and 186 in 2017. “The terminal is deserted, with an insufficient flow of people,” Tam said. “The terminal is built with a beautiful park and so much indoor space. “I hope the government can promote the area. It can help both boost Hongkongers’ spirits from the current depressing social atmosphere, and also help benefit the businesses here.” 	SCMP

The Civil Human Rights Front, which was behind two peaceful marches in June against the now-withdrawn extradition bill – which it estimated drew more than 1 million and 2 million people, respectively – received its first police approval for a protest on Hong Kong Island since mid-August on Thursday. The Sunday march came ahead of the UN’s Human Rights Day on Tuesday. Marchers are expected to call for an independent probe into claims of police brutality during the social unrest of the past six months. The front’s convenor, Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, called on Friday for marchers to not argue with police officers, and leave communication with the force to the group’s about 200 marshals. “If the turnout is too big and Hennessy Road’s westbound lanes ... are not enough for the march to go smoothly, our marshals will coordinate with police to open up more roads,” Sham said. The front had told the force it expected 32,000 people to join the march.  “We hope marchers can give some time to the front ... and reduce contact with the police.” Sham urged police officers to exercise restraint and maintain communication with the front. Stay or go: Hongkongers consider emigration options amid protests Stay or go: Hongkongers consider emigration options amid protests The convenor also said he believed hard-core protesters would consider the elderly and people with disabilities among marchers, and try to keep the procession peaceful, adding that the front would arrange for marchers to disperse at the Central end point.  “They know when to do what,” Sham said, adding that the front would have no choice but to end the march if police ordered it.  To echo the message of Human Rights Day, Sham called on Hongkongers to voice support for people facing humanitarian crises around the world, such as human rights activists and Tibetans in mainland China, and Kurds in Turkey. Civic Party lawmaker Tanya Chan, the current convenor of the Legislative Council’s pro-democracy bloc, remarked that the Sunday march would come half a year after the first of the front’s major peaceful marches in June. Lunchtime protests resurgent as hundreds take to streets across Hong Kong 6 Dec 2019 Lunchtime protests resurgent as hundreds take to streets across Hong Kong 6 Dec 2019 “I hope on Sunday we can use a peaceful, rational and non-violent way to press on with the five demands,” Chan said, referring to popular calls among protesters and the wider public to democratise local elections and grant amnesty to those arrested during the protests, as well as other demands. According to the letter of no objection from the police to the front, the march will set off from Victoria Park, Causeway Bay at 3pm on Sunday. Marchers can gather at the park from noon, before heading to Chater Road in Central via Hennessy Road and Queen’s Road Central. The procession is scheduled to end by 10pm. Police had previously expressed concerns over a potential “breach of peace” and other unlawful acts, and asked the front to take measures to ensure the event would be conducted in a lawful and orderly manner. Senior Superintendent Ng Lok-chun, who oversees police operations on Hong Kong Island, warned on Friday that the force could axe the march if there is any violence, adding that officers would only use tear gas or firearms if necessary. “We will try our best to give enough warning and communicate with the marshals at the scene, to tell people that this procession is no longer safe and ask them to disperse immediately,” he said. He refused to say how many officers would be deployed on Sunday to police the march. 	SCMP

In San Po Kong, about 100 people, including office workers, students and retirees, marched along Tai Yau Street, chanting “Disband the police force!

A music instructor, surnamed Fung and in his 20s, said he would continue to protest regardless of the weather. “If we can beat the heat, I’m sure the cold weather is not a big problem,” he said. “We won’t stop until the government responds to our demands.”   “Even though the turnout at the lunchtime protest in San Po Kong might be very small, I’m hoping that we can still stand strong together at the Sunday march to reiterate our demands,” he added.

Ms Suen, 22, a clerk who works in Causeway Bay, agreed that protesters’ momentum had dwindled somewhat after the district council elections.

Lau said it was “difficult” to say whether the march would be peaceful. He believed, as well as some protesters, police and the government were also blame for the clashes at recent protests. “It is usually because the government did not respond [to demands] and the increased use of force by police that protesters have to escalate their actions ... just like the march in Tsim Sha Tsui when police used tear gas when the letter of no objection was still effective,” he said. march in Tsim Sha Tsui 	SCMP

Katrin Goering-Eckardt, leader of the Greens in Germany’s parliament, did not elaborate on the reasons given by a Chinese vice-minister of foreign affairs, but said the two had disagreed over how to address police violence, and the next steps to deal with the crisis in the city.

Zhao Kezhi, who met Tang in Beijing on Friday, said the central government was giving the “strongest backing” to the force as the ongoing social unrest reaches its sixth month.

The mass rally and march on Sunday is the first organised by the front to secure permission from police since August 18.  The force has rejected several applications in recent months for the pro-democracy group’s events, on the grounds of public safety and the risk of violence.  “Police have rarely objected to public rallies since the handover of Hong Kong [in 1997]. But since June, whenever there have been large-scale public order events, there were violent protesters or mobs hijacking [the protests] and committing illegal acts,” said Tang, who pointed to the hurling of petrol bombs, blocking roads and arson as examples of criminality.

Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit Sham, convener of the front, challenged Tang to “set a good example” and condemned police officers who used excessive force against protesters. “We cannot ignore the violence from the bullies and condemn the force used by those fighting back,” Sham said. “When people in power are sanctioned, we will definitely take a hard look at the shortcomings in protesters’ actions.

The veteran businessman and former executive councillor said he hoped to form a task force within the authority’s board to look into the sustainability of the public health care system. Commenting on the protests, Fan, who is the older brother of current executive councillor Fanny Law Fan Chiu-fun, said he welcomed the government’s plan to form a committee to look into the underlying causes of the protests. He said “political problems had to solved by political means,” but the committee should be formed under the Commission of Inquiry Ordinance. “That would then give statutory position to the committee, which would then enable the committee to call witnesses. Witnesses giving evidence before the committee would also be protected from civil or criminal actions,” Fan said.  “Without this statutory power, firstly it would be difficult for the committee to work; secondly there would also be a problem with its credibility,” he said, adding that the investigation would not be able to avoid looking into police operations. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said last week that an independent review committee would look into the causes of the recent crisis. But protesters were unimpressed, demanding a commission of inquiry that would also investigate alleged police brutality during protests. Unless we have a system which would allow our public health system to be sustainable, sooner or later we’ll run into trouble Henry Fan, Hospital Authority chairman Fan’s eyes welled up as he recalled some A&E doctors telling him about when they treated severely injured young protesters.  “They told me how they have seen [those young people] seriously beaten up. I really sympathised with them, but as I’m part of the Hospital Authority, I cannot show any political stance,” he said.  Fan said his heart ached when he saw youngsters being arrested, and what Hong Kong has turned into in the past few months. The anti-government protests have prompted health care staff to hold rallies in public hospitals, airing dissatisfaction at police conduct, among other grievances. Fan urged workers not to hold rallies in public hospitals, saying the authority should not show any political stance. Teacher accused of assault during citywide strike has charge dropped 5 Dec 2019 Teacher accused of assault during citywide strike has charge dropped 5 Dec 2019 “Some patients who have different political views might feel uncomfortable [when seeing the rallies],” he said. “They might also worry about whether health care staff who have different political views would treat them properly.” Fan said he believed recent unrest might have deterred some foreign-trained doctors from joining the authority. This year, among 36 overseas doctors offered jobs in public hospitals, 17 had declined, he said. The authority was still awaiting replies from the other 19. A source from the authority said there had been “very few” such refusals previously. Stay or go: Hongkongers consider emigration options amid protests Stay or go: Hongkongers consider emigration options amid protests On his upcoming work with the authority, whose board he joined in December last year, Fan said he hoped the task force he pushed for would be able to improve the sustainability of the public health care system. “Unless we have a system which would allow our public health system to be sustainable, sooner or later we’ll run into trouble,” he said, adding that the task force would look into ways to retain manpower and reduce waiting times, among other things. He said he would officially propose forming such task force at a board meeting on December 19. Staffing is a long-standing problem at public hospitals, with less urgent patients waiting months to see a doctor at specialist outpatient clinics. 	SCMP

A motion to remove Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor from office, launched under Article 73 of the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution, failed to pass through the Legislative Council on Thursday. It received 16 votes for and 14 against in the geographical constituency and 10 votes for and 22 against in the functional constituency. The motion needed a majority in both constituencies to pass. Six pro-establishment members were absent from the vote, including Liberal Party leader Felix Chung Kwok-pan, Roundtable’s Michael Tien Puk-sun and Priscilla Leung Mei-fun, of the Business and Professionals Alliance. Before the vote, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said on behalf of the government that the withdrawal of the extradition bill had put a “perfect full stop” to the source of the conflict. “People’s concerns should have been completely alleviated,” Cheung said. Civic Party leader Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu, who tabled the motion on Wednesday with the backing of 24 peers from his camp, said Lam should step down over her handling of the now-withdrawn bill, which drew the city into social unrest since June.  Many pro-government legislators spoke during the debate, including Starry Lee Wai-king and Leung Che-cheung from the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, Business and Professionals Alliance’s Abraham Razack and Heung Yee Kuk chairman Kenneth Lau Ip-keung. DAB chairwoman Lee strongly criticised the government for doing too little to end violent protests in recent months.  “Chief secretary, you said last month that nothing can be done to stop radicals from destroying our tunnel facilities. Do you know many people were so angry about what you said?” Lee said.  “The justice secretary was not at the forefront in explaining the government’s position over the past six months … and the undersecretaries have not said a word to help.” But Lee added that her party would vote against the motion because unseating the chief executive would create more chaos, instability and a power vacuum. Razack, representing the real estate sector, described the government as an “omnishambles” for not offering a political solution to the social unrest. While Razack said Lam should stay on as chief executive, he added the leader had been “aloof and uncompromising”. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a pro-Beijing camp lawmaker said he was urged by the administration to vote against the motion. “I told them not to say too much, I have my own decision,” the lawmaker said. Another from the camp who wished not to be named said Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong approached him to learn his stance on the motion. “It is difficult – but I’ll take up the pan-democrats’ saying, that I will not cut ties [with the chief executive] even if a nuclear bomb was deployed,” he said. Had the impeachment motion passed, it would have triggered an inquiry headed by the city’s top judge. If such an inquiry found sufficient evidence to impeach the chief executive and the motion was passed by a two-thirds legislative majority, Beijing would have had to decide whether to unseat Lam.

Speaking on Wednesday at a conference in Shenzhen, southern China’s Guangdong province, Jens Hildebrandt, executive director of the German Chamber of Commerce in China, said that although the often violent clashes between police and protesters had been bad for business, Hong Kong remained central to their operations. “They [German firms] really consider Hong Kong as their base,” he said. “They don’t put it into question and they don’t consider leaving.” As for how to resolve the long-running conflict, Hildebrandt said it would not be easy. “I think a solution is not in sight, because for a solution you would need to have more dialogue, and I don’t see that there has been enough dialogue,” he said.   Wolfgang Niedermark, chief representative of German Industry and Commerce, said that despite months of disruption, German businesses still had confidence in the city and that the adjustments they had been forced to make because of the dispute were “technical, not strategic”.  Hong Kong’s economy has been hard hit by the protests, which began in June with a mass rally in opposition to a now scrapped extradition bill. On Monday, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said the unrest would cut 2 per cent from the city’s gross domestic product and put it on track to record its first budget deficit in 15 years. Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po  According to a survey conducted last month by the German Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong, which has about 500 members, two-thirds of German businesses in the city reported a negative effect on revenue in the second half of the year.  The sectors most affected were retail and hospitality, with some hotel operators saying their revenues had fallen by up to 70 per cent from last year. Hildebrandt said that as a financial centre, Hong Kong had been able to weather the protests as “the stock exchange and all the funds, everything is digital”. “[But] even though Hong Kong’s role as a financial and logistics hub has not been severely affected, that does not mean there is not a greater need for broader, more comprehensive dialogue, and there’s a responsibility for officials in Hong Kong and Beijing to make that happen,” he said. Werner Steinmuller, a member of the management board at Deutsche Bank and vice-chairman of the Asia-Pacific Committee of German Business, said that while the protests had hit tourism and retail, Hong Kong’s core business of investment banking was “absolutely no different than before”. “Hong Kong is still safe,” he said. “Our business [at] Deutsche Bank is not affected.”   But Steinmuller, who lives in Hong Kong, did urge the city’s government and the protesters to try to find a way to resolve their dispute. “I think there is time to find a solution,” he said. “My expectation is hopefully after Lunar New Year things will be better. It’s a time of hope. I’m an optimistic person.” Chinese envoy repeats criticism of German politicians who met Joshua Wong 28 Nov 2019 Chinese envoy repeats criticism of German politicians who met Joshua Wong 28 Nov 2019 Dr Holger Bingmann, a board member of the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, said that during a recent visit to the city he had seen the effect the unrest had had on people working there. “I see Hong Kong entrepreneurs suffering mentally,” he said. “We should place a signal that this is an important part of the world,” he said. Despite the general optimism among German business leaders, a survey released last week by the Hong Kong Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry was less positive. Of the 270 companies that responded – about half its total membership – 106 said they were considering sending or had already sent the Japanese families of their employees back home. Meanwhile, eight firms said they had relocated all of their staff to Japan, a further eight said they would do so before the end of the year, and 90 more said they were considering such a move.

MTR Corporation The government-controlled company on Thursday revealed for the first time the financial exposure arising from the protests, which centred on lower revenue from train services, repair costs for damaged facilities, extra expenses for strengthening security and concessions to tenants of its retail space. As a result, the corporation warned of a significant decline in profits from a year ago for the financial year ending December 31. Hong Kong Federation of Railway Trade Unions vice-chairman Tam Kin-chiu said MTR management told him that despite the additional expenses and reduced income, the rail operator could still be profitable this financial year. Inside Hong Kong’s vandalised MTR stations Inside Hong Kong’s vandalised MTR stations “Since the MTR is still supported by its rental and property business, despite the additional expenses for its rail operation, the management estimates that it could still make profits this financial year,” he said. Last year, the company’s profit from underlying business grew 7.1 per cent to HK$11.26 billion.  The beleaguered firm emerged as a target of radicals in August – two months after anti-government demonstrations broke out – after they accused it of bowing to pressure from Beijing following a scathing attack by mainland Chinese media. The outlets accused MTR of facilitating the actions of mobs by laying on extra trains during protests.  The rail operator has since taken a tougher stance against protesters by obtaining a court injunction to prevent disruptive acts on its network and closing stations in advance of demonstrations. But it denied it kowtowed to Beijing’s pressure. The company, which currently carries nearly 5 million passengers a day, revealed that its patronage had been falling since July, with a decline of 27.4 per cent in October and 27.2 per cent in November from the same period last year.  “The MTR should reflect on why Hongkongers are giving up on taking its trains,” lawmaker Jeremy Tam Man-ho of the opposition Civic Party said. When the government’s ban on people wearing facial coverings during protests took effect on October 5, MTR suspended services on the entire network for the day. The following day, service hours on most rail services were shortened until December 1, only returning to normal after that. During protests, it shut down stations temporarily at short notice. As of November 24, radicals had caused extensive damage to 85 of 94 rail stations and 62 of 68 Light Rail stops. More than 1,900 turnstiles, 1,100 ticketing and top-up machines, 1,200 surveillance cameras, 202 lifts and escalators, as well as 190 roller shutters were damaged. Some 54 heavy railway trains and 16 Light Rail vehicles had also been damaged. MTR Corp blames vandalism for delay on cross-harbour section of rail link 4 Dec 2019 MTR Corp blames vandalism for delay on cross-harbour section of rail link 4 Dec 2019 Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick Chi-ming said it was no surprise to hear about the losses incurred by the firm. “A lot of revenue generated from its operations, however, is from property businesses, I guess there may not be a deficit for its overall financial results,” he said. Francis Lun Sheung-nim, chief executive of brokerage GEO Securities, said he expected more financial exposure would arise from the protests, which show no sign of abating. “It will only get worse,” Lun said, adding that since June he had maintained his “sell” recommendation on the stock. “It is a public secret that the MTR Corp is the second enemy of radical protesters after police, and they call it the ‘Communist Party Rail’.” MTR shares were up 35 HK cents, or 0.81 per cent, to HK$43.55 before the company announced its profit warning on Thursday. Despite MTR’s financial challenges, union chief Tam expressed hope that the rail giant would stick to the established wage adjustment mechanism and reward staff for their hard work in dealing with the radicals’ vandalism. “I hope the MTR Corp will offer us a pay rise next year in accordance with the current pay adjustment mechanism considering the contribution and hard work of the staff during these difficult times. We also hope our year-end bonuses will remain the same,” he said. Amid protest closures, use of Hong Kong’s railways is down by a quarter 21 Nov 2019 Amid protest closures, use of Hong Kong’s railways is down by a quarter 21 Nov 2019 For 2019, other than the protest-related loss, MTR’s results were hurt by HK$2.43 billion in provisions from a construction scandal involving Hung Hom station and a rail joint venture in Britain called First MTR South Western Trains. “The reduced profit was because of its poor supervision on the works at Hung Hom station,” lawmaker Tam said. The corporation said that owing to the impact of the social unrest, underlying business profit this year would be less than that of last year, but would have been higher without the total provisions.

Singapore-listed Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust has announced details on the reopening of its severely damaged Kowloon Tong shopping mall, weeks after protesters vandalised multiple floors and also set a large artificial Christmas tree on fire. The mall’s owner said it would need to repair glass entrances, glass curtain walls, escalators, lifts, and glass balustrades along the common areas. “We are working closely with our consultants and contractors to reopen, either partially or fully, in the first quarter of 2020,” the trust’s manager said in a statement on Wednesday. The manager said the reopening would also be subject to approvals to be obtained from the authorities, while adding that retail tenants’ rents would be waived during the closure. “While the loss of retail and office revenue, as well as the damage to the property, are covered under insurance policies, the assessment of the quantum of revenue loss and property damage recoverable by insurance claims is currently underway,” the statement read.  The mall is owned partially by Temasek Holdings, Singapore’s sovereign investment fund. During the six-month period to September 30, tenant sales at Festival Walk stood at HK$2.4 billion (US$306.5 million), the trust revealed to the Post last month. Post  Hong Kong has been rocked by almost six months of social unrest arising from the now-withdrawn extradition bill. social unrest extradition bill Singapore investor first to bear the brunt of Hong Kong’s protests as vandals laid waste to Festival Walk 20 Nov 2019 Singapore investor first to bear the brunt of Hong Kong’s protests as vandals laid waste to Festival Walk 20 Nov 2019 Violence hit the mall on November 12 when black-clad radicals broke glass and railings on several floors of Festival Walk, with some hurling a petrol bomb at its signature Christmas Tree that went up in flames.   Business at the shopping centre, which has more than 200 retail stores and restaurants, has ground to a halt since November 13. Festival Grand cinema at the mall is also closed. Many big brands have a branch at the mall, including Apple, fashion chain H&M, Marks & Spencer and Uniqlo, as well as Starbucks Coffee and Venchi. The closure, which could last up to five months, will mean even less earnings for businesses already struggling from a sharp decline in tourist arrivals and weak consumer sentiment under the shadow of political unrest. A CEO of a 13-strong restaurant group that runs an eatery in Festival Walk said anonymously that it had to pay HK$1 million a month in salaries to some 50 staff and payments on bank loans. Hong Kong businesses caught in crossfire of protest crisis 12 Aug 2019 Hong Kong businesses caught in crossfire of protest crisis 12 Aug 2019 “Other than the payment, we forgo revenue from this restaurant over the five months of closure,” he said. “We can’t just lay off the employees, because we will need them when the restaurant resumes business here. Now, they are either on leave or working at other restaurants of the group.” Simon Wong Kit-lung, CEO of the listed restaurant firm LH Group, said about 40 employees of his two branches at Festival Walk had to be relocated to his other eateries. Wong refused to disclose the actual impact of the mall’s closure on his business, but he said many other businesses in the food and beverages sector were not positive about the outlook for the months to come. Jewellery chain Luk Fook Holdings said the mall operator had also exempted other charges for tenants, while all its employees were deployed to other branches. 	SCMP

Officers from Police Tactical Unit and Identification Bureau, along with firefighters, took part in the search. Chief Inspector Wong Tsze-wai of Narcotics Bureau said the haul, consisting of 20 types of chemicals, was found hidden in the bushes at a hillside. Initial examination showed the dangerous goods included acids, such as sulphuric acid and nitric acid, and other corrosive solutions. “We don’t rule out if a part of the seizure is linked to the theft of chemicals from Chinese University,” he said. Chinese University is said to have lost about 80 litres of concentrated nitric acid, 17.5 litres of concentrated sulphuric acid, and 2.5 litres of hexane. “Criminals could have used the dangerous goods to make petrol bombs, acid bombs, and other weapons,” Wong said. He said the consignment posed risk to the public as it was left in an area hikers could easily have bumped into.  Wong said no leakage was found from the bottles seized at the scene, while some bottles had not been opened either. As the chemicals were found near a reservoir, the Water Supplies Department would make an appropriate follow-up action, the chief inspector said. One police source said the case was being investigated by the crime unit from the police headquarters, a department that has been handling crimes related to anti-government protests that has roiled the city since June. Personnel from the Police Tactical Unit were also deployed to scout the area and firefighters were on standby.  As of midday on Thursday, the area was still cordoned off by police.  Meanwhile, police said on their Facebook page on Wednesday night that they had seized about 10,000 petrol bombs from Chinese University, Polytechnic University, and other colleges and their surroundings, along with a large number of chemicals, offensive weapons, and raw materials for explosives. “Violence will not be condoned in any civilised society,” police said in the post. “One should call a spade a spade. There’s no room for grey areas. Police are making every effort to put an end to violence by enforcing the law.” After a 13-day siege of PolyU occupied by more than 1,000 protesters, police last Friday seized 4,296 petrol bombs, 671 bottles of chemicals and 622 pieces of weapons. Some 810 people were arrested when leaving PolyU during the siege, while police took the details of a further 318 youngsters aged under 18. Hong Kong's PolyU siege : From beginning to end Hong Kong's PolyU siege : From beginning to end A source had earlier told the Post that about 20 types of chemicals were reported missing from PolyU in Hung Hom, including 2.5 litres of concentrated sulphuric acid; 1kg of sodium metal; a small amount of zinc cyanide; sodium arsenite; hydrochloric acid; and DDT, an insecticide known for harmful environmental impacts. Post Protesters also occupied Chinese University for five days in November, during which they threw objects onto a nearby highway and railway tracks, and attacked police with petrol bombs and other weapons.

Protesters have vowed to hold a major march on Sunday, starting at Victoria Park in Causeway Bay, but this time there was no attempt to block roads in either area. At 12.45pm, a few dozen people gathered at a footbridge outside Exchange Square in Central, chanting political slogans and yelling, “see you at Victoria Park”. Ms Cheung, 30, who works in the finance industry, said she had joined lunchtime protests in Central “almost every day”, but felt there had been a drop in momentum, pointing to the pro-democrats’ success at the district council elections as one reason for that. “I worry that people’s passion might dwindle and that they might stop fighting for the demands,” she said. “If everyone returns to their normal lives and stops fighting, what many have sacrificed, including those who were charged, jailed, and have given up their futures, would all turn into dust. I hope people won’t forget our cause.”  Ms Yam, a freelance translator in her 40s, said she felt people might “have lost a clear goal” after the 13-day siege at Polytechnic University ended in arrests, and left protesters licking their wounds. But she did not think the cold weather would stop people from coming out.  “Winter is better than the scorching heat in summer,” she said. “When it’s cold, just put on some more clothes. I don’t think that would be a [concern].”  Some held placards that read, “independent review committee is not equal to independent commission of inquiry”.

Lunchtime protests this week have been attended by smaller crowds than previously. On Wednesday, about 100 protesters joined a rally in Cheung Sha Wan, while dozens showed up at IFC Mall in Central and in Kowloon Bay. The Civil Human Rights Front wants to organise a “World Day of Human Rights March” on Sunday, from Victoria Park to Chater Road in Central, to urge the government to uphold its commitment to human rights in handling protests. It is waiting for the police’s letter of no objection. Past demonstrations by the front have drawn huge numbers. 	SCMP

US-China trade war Three players in the food and catering industry and a retailer the Post interviewed on Wednesday said the sweeteners were insufficient to cushion the loss of business arising from a worsening tourism slump and recession. They called on landlords to cut rents and for peace to return to society. Post worsening tourism slump The government’s latest measures, worth about HK$4 billion (US$512 million), primarily involve subsidies on utility bills and allow qualified individuals and companies to pay tax bills in instalments. latest measures “The relief measures are helpful in the short term, but the largest costs are rent and salaries,” said Samme Cheng Pak-man, who supplies lunchboxes to schools. “The most practical help is to get society back to peace and a normal operating environment.” On Wednesday, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po revealed the fourth round of measures, which aim to help ease the cash-flow burden on taxpayers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A key measure will see the government pay 75 per cent of commercial users’ electricity bills for the next four months to March 31, capped at HK$5,000 per month.  Commercial users will also be exempt from paying 75 per cent of their water and sewage charges, with water fees capped at HK$20,000 per month and sewage charges at HK$12,500 per month over the same period. It is a small favour, but better than none. The industry has been seriously battered Michael Leung, restaurant owner For government rents and rates, the waiver for commercial accounts will rise to HK$5,000 compared with HK$1,500 previously. Michael Leung Chun-wah, who owns four Chinese restaurants with about 300 staff, said each outlet would get about HK$15,000 per month as a result of the sweeteners. However, that was just a fraction of the average HK$2 million to HK$3 million cost of operating a restaurant each month, he said.  “It is a small favour, but better than none,” he said. “The industry has been seriously battered.” The ongoing anti-government protests have rocked Hong Kong for nearly six months, evolving from peaceful demonstrations to violent clashes between radicals and police. Residential, commercial and tourist districts such as Tsim Sha Tsui, Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, Causeway Bay and Central have all been affected. anti-government protests  More than 40 regions have issued travel warnings or alerts to travellers heading to the city, with tourist arrivals slumping since August.

The latest measures are on top of a previous HK$21 billion in incentives the government dished out to help low-income groups, students, the logistics and tourism sectors, and SMEs. The CEO of a restaurant group with 13 eateries in Hong Kong said, on condition of anonymity, that each outlet stood to benefit by about HK$10,000 a month from the latest relief measures. “This is a drop in the bucket, but better than having no help,” he said. “We are urgently in need of rent cuts; otherwise, I am not sure how many restaurants will manage to stay afloat in the coming months.” Protests send Hongkongers to Taiwan in search of new lives Protests send Hongkongers to Taiwan in search of new lives In the case of this food and catering group, just three restaurants have had a rent cut, of about 10 per cent. The CEO said it had been difficult to lobby landlords for a temporary rent cut. He succeeded with one only because of special circumstances at the Festival Walk mall in Kowloon Tong. The mall was closed for repairs on November 13 after radical protesters threw a petrol bomb and set its artificial Christmas tree on fire, and destroyed glass and railings on several floors the night before. Hong Kong luxury retailers seek rent relief as protests leave malls deserted 4 Dec 2019 Hong Kong luxury retailers seek rent relief as protests leave malls deserted 4 Dec 2019 The mall was not expected to reopen until the first quarter of next year because of the huge damage. “Even though we had a rent cut for our restaurant in Festival Walk, we’ve had to forgo its revenue because we can’t do business,” the CEO said. “Dining traffic at our restaurants has been affected because train services were shortened and roads were blocked without notice.” Radicals blocked roads with bricks and other items during demonstrations and when they clashed with police, rail operator MTR Corporation cut service hours or shut stations temporarily. Pauline Wong, proprietor of stationery shop The Tree in Causeway Bay, watched the financial secretary’s announcement of new measures with a yawn. “For an independent shop like I run, the utility bills cost a few hundred dollars a month. What I desperately need is lower rent,” she said. Tree, which relied on local shoppers and tourists, had seen a double-digit decline in revenue since September from the same period last year, she said. Hong Kong protests bring biggest retail slump on record 3 Dec 2019 Hong Kong protests bring biggest retail slump on record 3 Dec 2019 Because the shop was losing money there was no tax due, Wong added, meaning the government’s offer of paying by penalty-free instalments for the 2018-19 year did not apply. Deloitte China tax director Ellen Tong said instalments would effectively help individual or company taxpayers relieve their cash flow pressure. Any delay in settling tax bills within six months would result in a 5 per cent surcharge and 10 per cent beyond the six-month period. “To further support individuals and corporates, we propose the government in its next budget waive provisional tax for all taxpayers in 2019-20 and 2020-21,” she said. She added that the basic allowance and married person’s allowance should be raised 13.6 per cent to HK$150,000 and HK$300,000 respectively. Lunchbox supplier Samme Cheng did not think the latest measures would help turn around the hostile business environment. “I unexpectedly had about 20,000 lunchboxes cancelled each day for three schools days last month because of protests. Who would ever have thought the protests would affect this type of business?” he said. “Because of the cancellation of classes, I need to refund the schools while still paying wages for about 100 staff and the rent. “Nothing can be better than everything getting back to normal.” 	SCMP

It is only the second time since 2002 that the rate has dipped below 40 per cent, the Post has learned. Post The trend was worrying, senior police sources said, pointing out that aside from the staffing crunch, numerous crimes committed by masked suspects were also proving difficult to crack. “Everyone in Hong Kong has a price to pay for the continuous, violent anti-government protests as they breed many other crimes,” a senior source said. The crime detection rate for the first 10 months of this year was down from 43.5 per cent for the same period in 2018, and 43.9 per cent in 2009. Annual reports available online, which date back to 2002, show that police have maintained their rate of solving crimes at around 40 per cent. It went below that benchmark only in 2003, when it hit 39.2 per cent.  Overall, the number of crimes reported between January and October dropped 0.7 per cent to 45,334, with violent crimes decreasing by 4.4 per cent to 7,219 cases, while crimes such as robbery, arson and vandalism were on the rise. Over a period of just one month, from October 6 to November 5, a total of 520 premises, such as railway stations, banks, shops and government buildings, were vandalised 667 times.  Another insider said shops under the Maxim’s Group, as well as railway stations, branches of Bank of China and Best Mart 360 were hit hardest, with some premises severely trashed more than once. Maxim’s Group Best Mart 360  Protests triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill have gripped the city since June. Radical protesters have vandalised, damaged and set fires at railway stations, major roads and university campuses, besides targeting businesses with links to mainland China. now-withdrawn extradition bill Arson cases shot up by 90.5 per cent to 461 in the first 10 months of this year, about a third of them protest-related. Criminal damage was up by 35.5 per cent to 5,491 cases, with a fifth linked to the unrest. Offences against public order, including engaging in unlawful assembly and rioting, went up 20-fold to 438. A senior crime buster said many detectives had been diverted from their jobs to handle protests over the past six months. He said there had been many crimes committed recently by “masked flash mobs”, and it took time to identify the suspects. Businesses affected by vandalism and arson during protests file up to HK$600 million in claims 28 Oct 2019 Businesses affected by vandalism and arson during protests file up to HK$600 million in claims 28 Oct 2019 “We have to sweep a lot of CCTV footage. Taking an arson case, for example, we need the government chemists to give us clues of the suspects and evidence. It all takes time,” he said. He said members of the public helping suspects get away was also making police work difficult. “The current situation is different from the past, when people would help us stop street crimes like fights. Now, people help suspects flee and even assault those who try to take pictures. It’s a kind of lawlessness,” the source said. “Fewer beat patrol officers on the streets means fewer chances of arresting suspects on the spot. Yet we are trying our utmost to bring criminals to justice.” These days, he added, police have to rely more on intelligence-gathering to solve crimes. On Tuesday, for example, intelligence-gathering helped officers track down a suspected robbery gang and arrest seven men believed to be on their way to commit a crime.

Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor The motion says Lam has committed “serious breaches of law” or “dereliction of duty” in her handling of both the now-withdrawn extradition bill and the social unrest it sparked. No vote was passed as the meeting closed at 7.30pm. The debate will continue on Thursday. “The chief executive who brought this disaster to Hong Kong should immediately resign,” Yeung said. In his speech, Yeung said Hongkongers had voiced their dissatisfaction with Lam and her government in the recent district council polls.  The city’s pro-government camp suffered a major setback in the November 24 elections, as it only managed to secure some 60 of 452 seats in the district councils. Pan-democrats won control of 17 of the city’s 18 councils. Carrie Lam points to violent protesters as ‘root of problems’ in Hong Kong 30 Oct 2019 Carrie Lam points to violent protesters as ‘root of problems’ in Hong Kong 30 Oct 2019 The motion, which requires a majority support from both the Legco’s geographical and functional constituencies, is unlikely to pass without the support of the pro-Beijing camp, which controls both constituencies. Pro-government lawmakers had been filibustering to block the motion from being tabled before the November 24 polls, to avoid having to vote down the motion, which could have cost them the support of the middle-ground voters.  In the motion, pan-democrats argued that Lam’s administration had used excessive force against peaceful protests since June, intimidating protesters with disproportionate criminal charges, “causing a rift in society”, and violating the public’s freedom of expression and assembly as stated in the Basic Law.  Protesters had been seriously hurt during clearance operations, and some were blinded by projectiles fired by police, the lawmakers noted. Should the motion pass, the Chief Justice will form and chair an independent investigation committee to look into charges against Lam. In case the committee finds enough evidence to substantiate the charges, lawmakers will vote again. If two-thirds of 69 sitting lawmakers support removing Lam, the Basic Law stipulates that the results will have to be reported to the central government “for a decision”. Carrie Lam insists she never offered to resign, denies Beijing is stopping her from quitting 4 Sep 2019 Carrie Lam insists she never offered to resign, denies Beijing is stopping her from quitting 4 Sep 2019 Representing the government, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung acknowledged the administration’s performance could be improved, but rejected the notion that Lam should step down. “The chief executive’s every decision has been lawful and constitutional, she did not break the law or commit dereliction of duty,” Cheung said. Cheung said the continuing protests had gone beyond the extradition bill, and he assailed radical protesters who vandalised train stations and attacked police as well as people with different political views. Since June, when the mass protests began, Lam’s popularity has plunged to historic lows. Polls conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute put Lam’s support rating at 19.7 last month from 43.3 in June. The lowest rating seen earlier was for Hong Kong’s first chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, at 36.2. 	SCMP

Under the policy that was implemented worldwide in September, Facebook removes content designed to identify children and create risks to their safety. Simon Harari, one of the company’s content policy managers, said the move was inspired by recent developments in Hong Kong. “We saw photos of police officers’ children being posted,” Harari said. But in these images, there were no threats that could trigger a removal under the company’s previous policies that only banned violence and slurs. “I think we can all agree that children have no business being put on Facebook against their will and being made part of this debate,” he said. Harari, who leads a policy team of 13 in the Asia-Pacific region, said the company had never before encountered problems with users posting general pictures of children.  As of late October, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data said it had received more than 2,600 cases relating to doxxing and cyberbullying. Doxxing is the malicious exposure of one’s personal information online, which often leads to nuisance or threats in real life.  Since the anti-government protests began in June, both protesters and police officers have fallen victim to cyber assaults, with the latter fearing for the safety of their children because their photos were posted online.  Harari said Facebook had a team of 15,000 people around the world to review content, including native speakers of more than 50 languages, to ensure cultural differences were considered. He said Facebook’s existing policies, which placed an emphasis on privacy and the deterrence of hate speech, could already prevent doxxing or cyberbullying. For example, users were barred from posting another’s personal phone number, email address, home address or identification card number. “If you post any sort of information that can somehow be used either for the purposes of stealing someone’s identity or subjecting them to real-world harm, that is going to be captured by our policy,” he said. But the platform also wanted to make sure people could conduct debates online, free from excessive restrictions. One such example was the slurs exchanged during Hong Kong’s protests, with protesters often referring to police officers as “dogs” and members of the force retaliating with the term “cockroaches”. While the slurs were intended to dehumanise, Harari said Facebook would not intervene as long as the comments did not also contain threats of violence or targeted an individual based on sex, ethnicity or religion. The spread of misinformation was also an issue during the roiling protests, with allegations levelled against both sides. Harari said Facebook had paired up with French news agency Agence France-Presse to verify claims and rearranged false posts so they would not be seen by 80 per cent of users. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, also implemented the policy. 	SCMP

MTR Corporation In a Legislative Council paper issued on Wednesday, the rail giant estimated the Hung Hom-Admiralty section of the scandal-hit Sha Tin-Central rail link would be delayed from the previously revised fourth quarter of 2021. The MTR Corp said the further delay was caused by persistent vandalism to facilities on the East Rail line – which serves part of the HK$99.1 billion link – during the months-long anti-government protests. anti-government protests “Since October, East Rail line facilities have been damaged repeatedly, resulting in the cancellation of the rail link’s construction during non-service hours. Because of this, our project team has been unable to conduct scheduled tests on the East Rail line’s new signalling system,” it said, adding that it also hindered railway connection work and the replacement of trains. “The MTR Corp estimates that the Hung Hom-Admiralty section’s opening will need to be delayed to the first quarter of 2022.” The company said the link’s newly installed signalling system and electrical facilities had suffered severe damage, with about 4km affected.  “The MTR Corp needs to purchase more parts to replace the damaged facilities and conduct the tests again,” it said. Amid protest closures, use of Hong Kong’s railways is down by a quarter 21 Nov 2019 Amid protest closures, use of Hong Kong’s railways is down by a quarter 21 Nov 2019 “We are still making an overall assessment of the impact on the Sha Tin-Central link project.” It said the Highways Department estimated the rail operator might need more time to complete the remaining construction. “The department is now in discussions with the MTR Corp about speeding up some major construction processes,” the firm said.  Pro-government lawmaker Michael Tien Puk-sun said it would be possible for the cross-harbour section to begin operating within 2021, should vandalism against railway facilities and signalling equipment stop immediately. Inside Hong Kong’s vandalised MTR stations Inside Hong Kong’s vandalised MTR stations But Tien, former chairman of the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, said the MTR had played safe and set the opening date in 2022.  “It seems the matter is in the hands of a handful of violent protesters,” Tien said. “So long as there is destruction, [the MTR Corp] will delay it further.” Hong Kong has been rocked by social unrest since June, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. Radicals have targeted the rail giant, believing it has colluded with police and bowed to pressure from Beijing by shutting stations during protests, among other things. extradition bill As of November 24, radicals had caused extensive damage to 85 of 94 rail stations and 62 of 68 Light Rail stops. More than 1,900 turnstiles, 1,100 ticketing and top-up machines, 1,200 surveillance cameras, 202 lifts and escalators, as well as 190 roller shutters were damaged. Some 54 heavy railway trains and 16 Light Rail vehicles had also been damaged. The rail operator said damage to University station was so severe it would require work on a scale similar to rebuilding it completely. University station It said vandalism of its facilities had cost hundreds of millions of dollars to repair. As to the partial opening of the first part of the link – from Tai Wai to Kai Tak – the firm said the section was undergoing a trial run and it aimed to open it in the first quarter of 2020 as scheduled. The first section had been expected to open in the middle of 2019, after the original target of December 2018 was pushed back by construction delays. Later, due to a construction scandal involving shoddy work at Hung Hom station, the section was further delayed to the end of 2021. 	SCMP

But two local scholars argued they could hardly undermine the anti-government protest in Hong Kong, now into its sixth month, which had been leaderless so far. The four men – from Ukrainian activist group Gonor – were seen at a march in Tsim Sha Tsui on Sunday. They included Ihor “Maliar”, a former veteran previously involved in resistance against Russian expansion in Ukraine, and Serhiy Filimonov, a former head of a branch of far-right party National Corps in Kiev. The US State Department categorises National Corps as a “nationalist hate group”, which has been accused of attacking and destroying a Romany camp in Kiev in June 2018. Filimonov denied the incident was violent. Maliar was previously involved in a racist attack at a football match in Kiev in 2015.  Both are also veterans of the far-right Azov Battalion that has fought against Russia and its proxies since 2014. Critics have linked some members of the battalion to neo-Nazi ideology. According to the social media profiles of Filimonov and Maliar, the group of four – two of whom wore press passes – had joined an authorised march in Tsim Sha Tsui on Sunday afternoon, which later descended into sporadic confrontations with police in Mong Kok and Whampoa. They were mostly seen observing or posing in front of riot police or a railway station on fire in Mong Kok on Sunday evening.  They also posed for a picture outside the police cordon of Polytechnic University, which was caught in the crossfire between radical protesters and police and became the site of a 13-day siege in November.  They also visited Ocean Park, where they took videos of pandas and rode on roller coasters. Filimonov told the Post they had wanted to visit Hong Kong since the Occupy movement in 2014. Post “We are here to observe and maybe to learn. We are not here to teach the protesters,” he said. “While we may sympathise with the protesters, we understand that our involvement would only hurt their cause because of negative publicity. We would not want that.” He dismissed the far-right allegations, saying they had not been involved in any activities against minority or ethnic groups. “We do not approve of discrimination or intolerance,” he said. Filimonov also claimed they were wearing press passes because they would be “writing about the protests in Ukrainian media”. But Michael Colborne, a fellow at the Centre for the Analysis of the Radical Right and a journalist specialising in far-right activism, said Filimonov’s track record of far-right and street violence could be used by the mainland or Hong Kong authorities’ hand to delegitimise the local protests. “I think their ‘protest tourism’ alone is distasteful and dangerous, in what is an incredibly tense and unpredictable environment,” Colborne said. We are here to observe and maybe to learn. We are not here to teach the protesters Serhiy Filimonov “They may well not be teaching anyone anything or taking part. But the way they’re posing for photos, posting videos, and continuously valorising and aestheticising street violence while they pose all hip and cool makes it clear the reason they’re there is for themselves.” Wilson Chan Wai-shun, a lecturer at Chinese University’s Global Studies Programme, however said the mere presence of individual activists could not affect the entire movement in Hong Kong, or the international perception of the outside world. “Of course there are moral risks when some of these activists come in town, but some Hongkongers have travelled to Catalonia to support the movement there. Would we say Hongkongers have hijacked that movement?” Chan asked. “In a leaderless movement, there is little control who can come to the protests, but this does not suggest the nature of the movement itself has changed.” International relations scholar Kenneth Chan Ka-lok at Baptist University said the group was not notorious enough for the authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing to discredit the protest movement.

The daughter of the founder of Maxim’s – whose restaurants have been repeatedly smashed up by the city’s hard-core protesters – also hit out at the parents of young children who refused to instil patriotism in their offspring and did not bring them up “correctly”. Wu is founder and serving member of the management committee of The Chinese Foundation Secondary School in Siu Sai Wan and a former member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Standing Committee, the country’s top political advisory body. The Hong Kong government previously tried to introduce a “national education” subject into the curriculum at primary and secondary schools to nurture Chinese patriotism in 2012, but the move was seen by critics as an attempt to push propaganda from mainland China. previously tried to introduce The government, under then chief executive Leung Chun-ying, was forced to shelve its plans following a backlash from students and parent concern groups. The campaign propelled Joshua Wong Chi-fung, the pro-democracy activist, to fame at the age of 15. Leung Chun-ying, Joshua Wong Chi-fung  On Tuesday, in an interview with Chinese state broadcaster CGTN, the English-language branch of CCTV, Wu said more should have been done by schools to foster national identity. “Since 1997, our Education Bureau has been very much out of touch,” she said. “They did not realise that Hong Kong is becoming an SAR [special administrative region] of China.”  Wu said the bureau should have encouraged government schools to take a more active role in teaching pupils to value their national identity, starting at primary schools and kindergartens.  Pupils should be taught to “understand Hong Kong is part of China and to appreciate they are Chinese nationals”, she said, adding they should learn more about the national anthem. Founder’s daughter hits out at protesters who target Maxim’s outlets 10 Oct 2019 Founder’s daughter hits out at protesters who target Maxim’s outlets 10 Oct 2019 The bureau should shoulder some of the blame for many teenagers rejecting their Chinese identity and only considering themselves Hong Kong people, without “any kind of attachment to Beijing”, Wu added. “The Education Bureau has never been interested to promote this national education,” she said. “So for the last 20 years, the young people in Hong Kong have only been trained to say they’re born in Hong Kong.” Some textbooks and teachers had been “anti-China”, which further hardened teenagers’ attitudes to the mainland China, Wu said. Wu also accused parents of spoiling their children and being “very much not in tune” with the mainland, or holding any interest in understanding more about it. Many parents did not “nurture their children correctly” as rounded citizens, she said. “Parents of the young children now, they are in their late 30s or early 40s, they are the generation [that] have not gone through the hard times in Hong Kong, and they have not received a very accurate national education,” Wu said. Daughter of Maxim’s founder says she has lost hope in city’s next generation 4 Nov 2019 Daughter of Maxim’s founder says she has lost hope in city’s next generation 4 Nov 2019 Last month in an interview with state newspaper Global Times, Wu also criticised young people for “not having any idea about what they are doing” and said she had given up hope for the city’s next two generations. Global Times Wong Kwan-yu, chairman of the pro-Beijing Federation of Education Workers in Hong Kong, agreed the bureau could have come up with stricter requirements for teachers to foster students’ national identities. “There is currently a discrepancy at different schools in promoting national education and national identities. Some schools have done that well, but there are also schools which have been seriously lagging behind,” said Wong. Chinese linked companies targeted during Hong Kong protests Chinese linked companies targeted during Hong Kong protests But kindergarten principal and vice-president of the pro-democracy Professional Teachers’ Union, Elaine Kwan Shuk-ling, disagreed. She said children at kindergartens had been taught for years about Hong Kong being part of China and the importance of their Chinese identities. The bureau had provided kindergartens with materials to promote national identities, while the government’s curriculum guidelines also clearly put “national identity” as one of the core values, she added.

The Education Bureau said in a reply to the Post that it shared responsibility for fostering students’ values, but that the causes of young people taking part in illegal activities were complex and involved more than the education system. Post It said it would “listen humbly” to stakeholders’ views as it acknowledged that many who cared about Hong Kong and had high expectations of the education sector were saddened by what had happened with the ongoing protests. Different strategies would continue to be adopted to push forward national and values education at schools to strengthen students’ sense of national identity, it said.

At 1.15pm, about 30 people gathered at the junction of Cheung Lai Street and Cheung Shun Street in the industrial district of Cheung Sha Wan chanting slogans, such as “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times” and “five demands, not one less”. The crowd grew bigger to only about 100 at its peak later. About two dozen riot police officers had been guarding the intersection even before protesters showed up. Police presence was also heavy on nearby roads, including Cheung Sha Wan Road, Castle Peak Road, and Tai Nan West Street. Although the protest was largely peaceful, a verbal dispute broke out between around five protesters and riot police on Cheung Sha Wan Road, when the demonstrators hurled abuses at the officers. No arrest was made. Wearing school uniform and a gas mask, Form Two student James said he had been joining the lunchtime protests since last Friday.

Last week, some 100 protesters brought traffic to a halt at the same intersection in Cheung Sha Wan.  But on Wednesday, the demonstration was largely peaceful as protesters only walked along the pavements.  Hong Kong protesters have succeeded in getting the government to withdraw the extradition bill which triggered the unrest, over fears that fugitives might be sent to mainland China, among other jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no exchange arrangements. But they have four other demands: an independent inquiry into allegations of police brutality; an end to referring to the protests as riots; amnesty for all those arrested during the protests; and universal suffrage. At IFC Mall in Central, dozens of protesters held posters and chanted similar slogans, singing the protest song Glory to Hong Kong.

Beijing suspended visits Hong Kong Relations between the US military and China’s People’s Liberation Army would not be affected by the ban on port calls, General Mark Milley, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and his Chinese counterpart, General Li Zuocheng, agreed in an “introductory” telephone call, according to a statement from the Pentagon. The pair also promised to create “an opportunity to discuss building a constructive and results-oriented defence relationship”, it said. “The two military leaders agreed on the value of a productive dialogue, effectively managing differences, and cooperation on areas of common ground,” it said, without providing further details.   China’s foreign ministry said on Monday that all reviews of requests made by US military aircraft and vessels to visit Hong Kong had been suspended, apparently in retaliation for US President Donald Trump signing into law the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which allows Washington to impose sanctions on officials deemed to have violated human rights in the city. Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act The conversation between Milley and Li was not their first. The pair met in Beijing in 2016 when they were both heads of their respective armies. China protests as US passes Uygur bill on human rights in Xinjiang 4 Dec 2019 China protests as US passes Uygur bill on human rights in Xinjiang 4 Dec 2019 A person close to the PLA’s Joint Staff Department said the call showed the two sides were determined to maintain a cooperative relationship despite the ruling from Beijing.  “It means military ties between the PLA and their American counterparts will remain stable even though [China] banned American warships and aircraft from making port visits in Hong Kong,” he said. “The ban on port calls is just a diplomatic and political gesture to pacify the Chinese public after Trump signed the Hong Kong bill. The PLA doesn’t really want to fight with the Americans.” The two nations have locked horns over a number of military issues in recent years, not least in the South China Sea.  Beijing claims about 90 per cent of the waters – though is locked in territorial disputes with several regional neighbours – and has accused the US of infringing on its maritime rights with its so-called freedom of navigation operations.  For its part, Washington has criticised Beijing for building artificial islands in the disputed waters and ramping up its military presence there.

The major difficulties were “America’s increased surveillance in the South China Sea and its intervention on the Taiwan issue, neither of which are easy to resolve in the short term”, Shi said. Milley’s visit to Beijing in 2016 came after an international arbitration panel ruled against China’s territorial claims to almost the entire South China Sea, to which Beijing responded by vowing to continue developing artificial islands there.

Cathay Pacific anti-government protests The bulk of the company’s 27,000 airline staff will receive a year-end payment of HK$30,000 (US$3,800), or one month’s salary, whichever is lower, CEO Augustus Tang Kin-wing announced in a memo to staff. “I recognise the disappointment of not being paid a Discretionary Year-End Bonus and hope the ex-gratia payment represents a token of our goodwill and appreciation,” Tang said. “I know people are pulling together and supporting each other through what has been a very turbulent period.” Staff will next year receive a pay rise of 2 per cent, down from the wage increases of between 3 and 8 per cent paid to some 14,600 workers last year. Hong Kong’s rate of inflation stood at 3.1 per cent in October. Cathay Pacific, fresh from issuing two profit warnings, plans to fly fewer flights as demand for its flights wanes due to the impact of the civil unrest in Hong Kong, which was triggered six months ago by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. The airline’s Flight Attendants Union, which has members who found out they no longer had jobs after posting social media message in support of the anti-government protests, said it accepted the lower-than-expected annual settlement.  Hong Kong’s flagship airline last week said it would scale back its capacity by 1.4 per cent next year, reversing an earlier plan to grow by 3.1 per cent. by 1.4 per cent next year Tang said last week no more routes would be cut outright, but that the company would unveil cost control measures, aiming to be “proportionate to the challenges we face”.

Cathay Dragon cabin crew were also excluded. The Cathay Pacific Group include its flagship long-haul namesake airline, regionally-focused Cathay Dragon, budget unit HK Express and all-cargo carrier Air Hong Kong among its major brands.

The criticism by the Civil Aviation Administration of China also triggered the resignation of Rupert Hogg as CEO and his deputy Paul Loo Kar-pui. 	SCMP

They were commenting on remarks by National People’s Congress chairman Li Zhanshu who earlier in the day had described Macau as a role model for implementing the “one country, two systems” principle that also applies in Hong Kong. Analysts said the signal from Beijing was that while the central government appreciated the differences between the two cities given their separate colonial pasts, it expected both to put that guiding principle into practice. The lessons for Hong Kong from Macau, they said, included ensuring the right people were in charge and implementing a national security law which Beijing considers critical. Speaking at an event in Beijing on Tuesday to mark the 20th anniversary of Macau’s Basic Law, Li urged Hong Kong to be more like Macau, and stressed that the two special administrative regions’ legal and constitutional systems could not be treated outside China’s national constitution.  He heaped praise on Macau for having the social foundation for implementing the Basic Law, and having “patriots” in key government posts. Li, who is head of China’s legislature, urged Macau’s civil servants to strengthen their understanding of China’s constitution, adding that this should be part of their performance appraisal and recruitment. He said Hong Kong also needed to heed central government’s policies, the constitution, and the central government’s comprehensive jurisdiction over the two cities which enjoy a high degree of autonomy.  “The central government has the same demands for both Hong Kong and Macau,” he said.  Macau introduced its own national security law 10 years ago to implement Article 23 of its Basic Law and set up a national security commission last year. The Hong Kong government, on the other hand, backed down from putting Article 23 of the city’s Basic Law in place after 500,000 people took to the streets to protest against it on July 1, 2003. Some mainland Chinese scholars said Li’s comments showed that the central government was aware of the differences between Macau and Hong Kong and would not apply the same standards to both.  He said Beijing used the same benchmarks to measure success in implementing the “one country, two systems” principle in both cities, but added: “The governance of the two special administrative regions naturally will have different forms, like the continental law adopted in Macau and the common law system in Hong Kong, or their institutional arrangements. “We should promote both their successful experiences to each other, as well as learn the lessons from each other’s problems.” Li Xiaobing, who attended the Beijing event where Li Zhanshu spoke, agreed that the Hong Kong government needed to strengthen its selection of principal officials. who attended the Beijing event where Li Zhanshu spoke, agreed that the Hong Kong government needed to strengthen its selection of principal officials. Li Zhanshu said having patriots in key government positions has been instrumental in Macau’s success in implementing the “one country, two systems” principle. said having patriots in key government positions has been instrumental in Macau’s success in implementing the “one country, two systems” principle. Li Xiaobing said there was a pressing need for Hong Kong to fulfil its duty to enact national security legislation, but it should first identify the stumbling blocks and work out solutions. Gu Su, a political scientist at Nanjing University, said Li Zhanshu’s remarks showed that while Beijing was determined to keep Hong Kong and Macau under its full control, it would allow them to be different from mainland China. “Things can be done through legislation and strengthening the police force’s management of public order,” he said. “But in the administration of justice, Hong Kong has a strongly independent judiciary and if you meddle with it, there will be fierce opposition.” Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of the semi-official think tank The Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said Li Zhanshu’s speech indicated the central government’s intention of using Macau as the model of successful implementation of the “one country, two systems” principle, particularly in safeguarding national security. “The central government sees Macau’s achievements as a yardstick to measure the performance of the leaders of Hong Kong’s government,” Lau said. Lau said many Hongkongers, including some legal sector elite, had an incorrect understanding of China’s constitution and even rejected the central government’s authority in the relationship between Beijing and Hong Kong. “Some Hong Kong people in the civil service and legal sector had colluded with external forces in the recent political turmoil,” Lau said, referring to nearly six months of anti-government protests but without elaborating. “I think the central government will exercise its power in future to rectify such phenomena.” In October, the Hong Kong government invoked the colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance to introduce a ban on the use of masks, in an effort to quell the increasingly violent protests. Two weeks ago, the city’s High Court declared the anti-mask law unconstitutional, a decision that drew strong criticism from the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People’s Congress Stand Committee. The commission declared that whether a local law was in conformity with the Basic Law could only be decided by the Standing Committee. The Hong Kong government is appealing against the High Court decision. 	SCMP

Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin marked the occasion by getting together via video link and exchanging the usual pleasantries. But beyond the warmth and talk of expanding cross-border business, the two countries are being driven together by a common enemy: the United States. For that reason, relations are expanding beyond broader economic ties to deeper security cooperation, and analysts say that may eventually develop into some form of military alliance. In a meeting with Russian security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev in Beijing later on Monday, the Chinese leader made his concerns clear. “The United States and some other Western countries have increased their interference in the internal affairs of China and Russia, threatened the sovereign security of the two countries, and impeded their economic and social development,” Xi said. He said that China and Russia must cooperate to “safeguard their core interests and the common security of the two countries, and maintain regional and world peace and stability.” The new pipeline will supply China with billions of cubic metres of gas from Russia. Graphic: SCMP The new pipeline will supply China with billions of cubic metres of gas from Russia. Graphic: SCMP The opening of the gas pipeline comes amid four days of security and law enforcement meetings between the two countries this week in Beijing.  The gathering is the first of its kind since China and Russia declared earlier this year that they had moved into a “new era” of bilateral relations. The cooperation will range over many sectors and industries, including energy, trade, technology, diplomacy and defence. This is cutting edge stuff now that Russia is starting to export Paul Dibb By any measure, the gas pipeline project is massive. It will pump 38 billion cubic metres (1.1 trillion cubic feet) of gas into China each year when it reaches full capacity.  The pipeline will be operated by the Russian state-controlled energy company Gazprom, which said the 30-year deal to supply China – worth an estimated US$400 billion – is the biggest contract in its history.  The two countries share one of the world’s longest land borders, stretching from a delta feeding the Sea of Japan to the steppes of Mongolia around 4,200km (2,600 miles) away. The border separates two economies that seem a natural fit, with Russia’s vast energy reserves and ample farmland able to help meet the needs of China’s growing economy and 1.4 billion people. Both countries have been reluctant to use the word “alliance” when discussing their security relationship, because the term is at odds with China’s current foreign policy. But military and political analysts said the increasing level of collaboration has put them on track to develop ever-deeper military ties. They point to Washington as the common denominator, with Russia still labouring under US sanctions following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, while China’s relations with America have come under increasing strain as a result of the trade war and the US reaction to the situation in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. Russia and China should be allowed to join G7, says Putin 10 Dec 2019 Russia and China should be allowed to join G7, says Putin 10 Dec 2019 Zhang Xin, an associate professor at the school of advanced international and area studies at East China Normal University, said the “new era” in relations between Moscow and Beijing was “related to a vision of a quite significant change in the basic balance of power in the world”. The US is supposed to be on the decline and China is on the rise, but the US is also exerting more and more pressure toward both China and Russia”. He said: “In this regard, the security collaboration is, if not completely, at least partially a response to this context.” It’s their natural response to come together to face this potential threat from the US Artyom Lukin As a sign of this increased cooperation, China took part in a major Russian military training exercise in September for the second year in a row, and then the following month Putin announced that Moscow would help its neighbour develop an early-warning missile defence system. major Russian military training exercise Putin announced that Moscow would help its neighbour develop an early-warning missile defence system “Until recently, Russia was supplying military equipment [to China] that was not the very best of the Russian equipment, but it was good enough and better than the Chinese equipment,” said Paul Dibb, emeritus professor of strategic studies at the Strategic & Defence Studies Centre of the Australian National University. “But now we see Putin supplying modern quiet submarines, modern supersonic anti-ship missiles, and he has offered to build a ballistic missile warning centre for China – this is cutting edge stuff now that Russia is starting to export.” China and Russia turn on gas pipeline ‘Power of Siberia’ as they forge stronger energy ties China and Russia turn on gas pipeline ‘Power of Siberia’ as they forge stronger energy ties Observers agree that this relationship may evolve beyond training exercises and arms sales to mutually opposing any US or Western military activities that are perceived as a threat – for example, on the Korean peninsula, or in Eastern Europe. “If this trend continues for another five or seven years, probably by the late 2020s, we could see something that could be properly called a de facto military alliance between China and Russia,” said Artyom Lukin, a researcher with the School of Regional and International Studies at the Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok. “Both Moscow and Beijing see the United States as their common adversary, as the superpower whose military primacy threatens both Russia and China. So it's their natural response to come together to face this potential threat from the US,” he said. Vladimir Putin says Russia is helping China build a missile early warning system 10 Dec 2019 Vladimir Putin says Russia is helping China build a missile early warning system 10 Dec 2019 These perceived threats go beyond the military sphere to include what Moscow and Beijing regard as US interference in domestic affairs. This is of acute importance to China as it grapples with an ongoing popular protest movement in Hong Kong and in Russia as Putin’s rule continues to be punctuated by demonstrations against government corruption. Russia wants to build Arctic route with China Russia wants to build Arctic route with China From the viewpoint of Moscow and Beijing, such events bear similarities to the pro-democracy Arab spring and the so-called colour revolutions in the former Soviet Union, which they believe were instigated by the West, said Raffaello Pantucci, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, an independent British defence and security think tank. “Moscow and Beijing are both stable authoritarian [governments] and they don’t want to get overthrown by democratising masses, and that concept and that analysis of the world ultimately binds them together,” Pantucci said. However, he noted that under the surface there were differences between the two that could lead to fissures further down the line – for example, China’s increasing presence in Central Asia, an area Russia considers part of its sphere of influence. . Discussions such as those being held about security and law enforcement this week suggest Russia and China may move beyond diplomatic and “symbolic” statements of support towards more tactical discussions, said Lukin. That could include, for example, Russia offering Beijing advice on countering popular movements like the protests in Hong Kong, he said. On an international level, the relations could then evolve into a “coordinated campaign by two authoritarian anti-Western powers” that leads to more military cooperation and even a disruption of the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific, said Dibb. Sino-Russian military days are increasingly becoming a topic of conversation in the US and Australia and it is likely that other regional players such as Japan are also studying developments closely. “There’s a sense of confidence from both [Russia and China] that it’s their time now, with a weak and a distracted West,” said Dibb. “Both have been successful at careful territorial salami slicing,” he said, referring to “the slow militarisation” of the South China Sea and Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine’s Crimea and Donbass regions five years ago. “So the question is, what’s the next move?” 	SCMP

In an open letter to students and university staff on Tuesday, Tuan also apologised for the disruption to their work and studies after they were forced to leave the campus during a week-long occupation by protesters earlier in November. The five-day occupation started on November 11, when protesters disrupted traffic on the Tolo Highway and trains on the East Rail line by dropping objects from the university’s Bridge No 2. Police attempts to enter were rebuffed in a fiery stand-off, which saw petrol bombs and tear gas exchanged, before protesters fled on November 15. “I was taken ill and admitted to hospital on November 16 but thankfully, with the care of our medical professionals, I have recovered and am now fully engaged in my responsibilities,” Tuan wrote, expressing his gratitude to all his well-wishers. Neither Tuan nor the university have revealed specifics of his illness.  On Monday, many students and staff wrote cards and letters to Tuan as the student union said messages collected would then be delivered to the president’s office. In his letter, Tuan also thanked the “relentless and tireless endeavours of colleagues and friends” from various sectors of the community for helping to end the situation peacefully.

The university resumed operation on November 25 with security stepped up. But areas where the most severe clashes happened remained closed. Tests for harmful substances in the air and water were still pending results.   Tuan, who took office last year, was the first university head in the city who said in October he would condemn proven cases of police violence during the anti-government protests that have been roiling the city for almost six months. He was later criticised by pro-Beijing figures and state media but received support from many students. 	SCMP

Wang Zhimin, Beijing’s top representative in the city, has seen his political fate become the talk of the town as the city’s anti-government protests – triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill – dragged on into their sixth month. Much of the discussion has centred on whether Beijing had misread the mood in Hong Kong because Wang’s Central People’s Government Liaison Office failed to pass on accurate intelligence. A landslide defeat for pro-Beijing candidates in the city’s district council elections last month, as well as speculation in the international media – later denied by the foreign ministry – that Wang was about to be replaced, have only added to the whirl of gossip. Thousands of protesters return to Hong Kong streets to reiterate five demands to government Thousands of protesters return to Hong Kong streets to reiterate five demands to government Thousands of protesters return to Hong Kong streets to reiterate five demands to government But when he appeared at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Tuesday, for a symposium to mark the 20th anniversary of Macau’s return to Chinese rule, Wang appeared keen to put a positive face on things. “How is it? Do I look great?” he asked reporters after the event.  When asked about reports of his imminent reassignment, Wang pledged to “continue to serve the city”, without directly answering the question, but added: “Thanks for the attention paid to me and the liaison office by our reporter friends.” Top Chinese official praises Macau, warns Hong Kong to toe state constitutional line 4 Dec 2019 Top Chinese official praises Macau, warns Hong Kong to toe state constitutional line 4 Dec 2019 Wang had earlier appeared at ease while shaking hands with Guangdong governor Ma Xingrui and other officials, before Li Zhanshu, the No 3 in the Communist Party hierarchy, delivered his message that Hong Kong should “pay heed to the central government’s policies”.

Although the United States is unlikely to risk angering Beijing further by sending warships on a port call to the self-ruled island, many Taiwanese internet users said the southern port city of Kaoshiung would “win big” if the Americans did decide to visit. The US military has never made an official port call to Taiwan, while Beijing opposes all forms of military exchanges between Washington and Taipei. A person on the PTT terminal bulletin board system joked such a visit would happen only when “US-China [trade] talks fall apart or reach a standstill”. China hits back at democracy act by suspending US military port calls in Hong Kong China hits back at democracy act by suspending US military port calls in Hong Kong 2 Dec 2019 A Taiwanese blogger wrote on Facebook that such a move could “stimulate spending in Kaoshiung by US naval officers and elevate Kaoshiung’s skills in naval vessel repairs”. Chen Fang-yu, a former visiting fellow at the Global Taiwan Institute, joked to his more than 19,000 followers on Facebook that the US military should go to Taiwan to “have fun”.  Aa a further incentive, he pointed to comments by Matthew O’Connor, head of the Kaoshiung branch of the American Institute in Taiwan, a de facto consulate, praising the city’s stewed meat rice as “tastier than Taipei’s”. Although Washington does not have official diplomatic relations with Taiwan, it has supported the island unofficially including through arms sales, joint military training programmes and high-level exchanges.

Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the US-Taiwan Business Council, wrote on Twitter on Monday that there should be an “associated impact” and commensurate response from the US to Beijing’s actions. “This is a perfect opportunity for the US Navy to redirect all scheduled HKG port calls to Kaohsiung,” he wrote. “The [People’s Liberation Army] PLA would be 100 per cent responsible for this development.” 	SCMP

Prosecutors said the students had vandalised five ticketing machines and seven Octopus card readers, in addition to spraying paint on 12 surveillance cameras. Acting Principal Magistrate Cheung Kit-yee ordered each of the two to bear half of the compensation, totalling HK$285,447, to the MTR Corporation for damaging the facilities. The pair, who has pleaded guilty to three counts of criminal damage, was sentenced to rehabilitation centre at Tuen Mun Court on Tuesday, the first sentencing on vandalising rail facilities since protests against the now-withdrawn extradition bill erupted in the city in early June. now-withdrawn extradition bill Cheung said a short-term custodial sentence was appropriate given the serious nature of the offence, which had caused considerable inconvenience to local residents who were stopped from taking the public transport because of the damage.

Papers submitted to the Legislative Council’s railway subcommittee revealed that 147 of the city’s 161 MTR stations had been subject to vandalism between June 12 and November 24, causing damage worth hundreds of millions of Hong Kong dollars.   Defence lawyers pleaded that the two youngsters were remorseful for their acts.  Kwok’s lawyer Kenny Chan Lee-lung said his client, who suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety disorder, had been unsettled by the news of young people committing suicide in his neighbourhood during the anti-government movement.

She said non-custodial sentencing options, such as a probation order or community service order, would not reflect the seriousness of the case.  “Notwithstanding a noble cause or the freedom of expression, one should not resort to unlawful means to express his or her views,” she said.  Also in Tuen Mun Court, security guard Lau Ka-chun, 26, admitted to possessing offensive weapons in a public place after he was caught carrying a dagger, an axe, a machete, and a military knife during an anti-government protest in Yuen Long on September 21. Prosecutors said Lau and about 100 protesters gathered at the junction of Fung Kam Street and Fung Yau Street North and chanted slogans at 9.50pm that day, before he was intercepted and arrested by police. In mitigation, Lau’s lawyer Jessica Chan Wing-yin said the weapons were the belongings of another unidentified protester who had asked Lau to carry them for him that night. “He had no idea this act would make him regret for the rest of his life,” she said.

But Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah, speaking on Tuesday, did not reveal how long she stayed in Beijing nor why she had decided to receive treatment in the capital and not Hong Kong. Cheng said she suffered a fracture and partial dislocation of her wrist in the incident on November 14 and had an operation in London. “The operation was carried out in Britain, and the [Chinese] embassy, when arranging my return … arranged for me to be transferred to Beijing, our capital,” she said after returning to Hong Kong on Tuesday evening. Cheng said she was discharged from a Beijing hospital on Tuesday where she had received further check-ups and medical treatment, but did not reveal how long she had stayed. A Department of Justice source said Cheng’s close aides were not informed about her transfer to Beijing, while her office declined to comment on how long she had stayed in the capital.  Cheng, one of the key officials overseeing the now-withdrawn extradition bill that triggered months of often violent protests in Hong Kong, was confronted by around 30 protesters in London and hurt her arm in a fall. She was on her way to an event to promote the city as a hub of dispute resolution, which was subsequently cancelled. Cheng said she would return to her office on Wednesday and stressed she had been communicating with her colleagues through email while on sick leave.  The justice minister has made key prosecutorial and judicial review decisions over the past weeks, including a recent appeal against the High Court’s ruling which had declared the anti-mask law unconstitutional, according to a department source.   Cheng said she was lucky to have escaped further attacks, adding it would take between three months and a year for her to make a full recovery. “[My] hand is, of course, painful but the pain in my heart that Hong Kong is still in the status it is, with such disorderly behaviour, is even greater.” 	SCMP

Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s remarks on Tuesday came a week after US President Donald Trump signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which allows Washington to impose sanctions on officials deemed to have violated human rights in the city. Under the legislation, Washington also has the power to suspend Hong Kong’s special trading status if it is deemed to have lost a significant degree of autonomy from Beijing, as promised under the “one country, two systems” framework. As a result, the city will also be subject to an annual assessment of the enforcement of export control laws that limit the sale of sensitive products overseas. Before her weekly cabinet meeting at the Executive Council on Tuesday, Lam said the legislation was groundless. “We believe it was completely unnecessary and unfounded. Hong Kong’s human rights and freedoms are protected by the Basic Law. I want to ask: which aspect of Hong Kong residents’ freedom was being eroded?” she said. How big a deal for businesses is the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act? 29 Nov 2019 How big a deal for businesses is the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act? 29 Nov 2019 “We are highly free in many aspects. We have the freedom for media to report news, for people to take part in assemblies, demonstrations and marches, and the freedom of religion. So it is very regrettable that a foreign legislature and government have used their legislation to meddle in Hong Kong affairs.” Lam said the long-term impact of the American law would depend on Washington’s assessment of the city’s situation. But in the short run, business confidence in Hong Kong would be dampened, she said.  “Now the impact is on confidence, as it has created an unstable environment,” Lam said. “Businesses will be worried about what kind of action Washington would take as a result of the assessment, and I noticed that all major business chambers were strongly opposing the legislation.    “We all know that US corporations play an important role in Hong Kong. There are more than 1,300 US companies in Hong Kong – most of which are regional headquarters,” she said. US Act likely to have little impact on Hong Kong shipping sector 2 Dec 2019 US Act likely to have little impact on Hong Kong shipping sector 2 Dec 2019 She said she had noted Beijing hitting back at the US over the act, announcing on Monday it would suspend visits of US military vessels and aircraft to Hong Kong and sanctioning various NGOs. Lam said her government would follow up on the sanctions announced. “This is a matter of foreign affairs, so we will cooperate in accordance with the central government’s requirements.” Peter Levesque, group managing director of container terminal operator Modern Terminals, warned that Trump’s decision to pass the act into law would risk Hong Kong losing transshipment business to rivals such as Singapore. He said the law, which stipulates an annual review on export controls, could affect transshipment volumes through Hong Kong in both sea freight and airfreight. “Export controls, when applied to a single destination like Hong Kong, can be ambiguous and difficult to enforce, particularly when similar technologies are readily available in the market.

Macau The remarks indicated that the landslide defeat of pro-Beijing candidates in last month’s elections had not altered Beijing’s long-term thinking about the two special administrative regions, an analyst said. landslide defeat of pro-Beijing candidates At the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Tuesday, Li Zhanshu, third in the Communist Party hierarchy, diverted from prepared remarks on Macau to make a direct point about Hong Kong. Li Zhanshu “I mostly talked about Macau today. But Hong Kong also needs to pay heed to the central government’s policies, the constitution, and the relation between [the central government’s] comprehensive jurisdiction over [Hong Kong and Macau] and their high degree of autonomy,” Li said. “The central government has the same demands for both Hong Kong and Macau.” What is the Basic Law of Hong Kong?

The event was attended by various academics advising Beijing and officials from Macau, as well as Vice-Premier Han Zheng, the top party member overseeing Hong Kong and Macau affairs. Vice-Premier Han Zheng  The comments came about a week after pro-democracy candidates won an overwhelming majority of seats in Hong Kong’s district council elections and after months of anti-government protests in the city. anti-government protests The protests – sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China – expanded to include other political demands, including universal suffrage to elect the city’s leader.

He called on civil servants to strengthen their understanding of the Basic Law and the country’s constitution, adding that it should be part of their performance appraisals and recruitment.

He said Beijing wanted Hong Kong to follow Macau’s example in safeguarding national security and upholding the central government’s authority. “Obviously, Beijing feels Hong Kong has failed to implement one country, two systems in the way it wants,” he said.

Visitor numbers will drop 8.7 per cent to 26.71 million for this year, according to data from Euromonitor International. Predicted growth of 6.9 per cent in second-placed Bangkok’s numbers would not be enough for it to take top spot, leaving the Thai capital on 25.84 million arrivals. The British-based research company ranked those two cities, plus London, Macau, Singapore, Paris, Dubai, New York, Kuala Lumpur and Istanbul, the 10 most popular destinations for 2018, having studied foreign visitor statistics across 400 cities. Foreign visitors are defined as people who visit another country for more than 24 hours, for a period not exceeding 12 months. In Hong Kong’s case – as well as that of Macau – it includes mainland Chinese visitors, who made up 78 per cent of the city’s total arrivals in the first 10 months of this year.    Euromonitor estimated global inbound arrivals would jump 4.2 per cent to 1.5 billion in 2019, with the top 100 cities, their total arrival numbers up 6.2 per cent from a year earlier, accounting for nearly 47 per cent of the total. It said Hong Kong’s attractiveness as a destination arose from its proximity to the mainland, its vibrant shopping and a strong cultural heritage.  Simon Haven, senior analyst at Euromonitor, noted that Hong Kong was starting from a strong base ahead of Bangkok, adding that the gap was going to narrow considerably in 2019. “The thing people forget is that the protests only really started to have an impact on arrivals in July, so that means that between January and June the numbers were very strong,” he said. Hong Kong protests bring biggest retail slump on record 3 Dec 2019 Hong Kong protests bring biggest retail slump on record 3 Dec 2019   Anti-government protests have gripped the city for just under six months, having been sparked by an extradition bill which has since been withdrawn. Demonstrations have regularly descended into clashes between residents and police, with the former hurling bricks and petrol bombs, and the latter responding with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon. Radical protesters have attacked railway stations and other transport links, causing travel disruption, as well as targeting businesses with perceived mainland links.  The disturbances have particularly hit popular tourist districts such as Causeway Bay, Tsim Sha Tsui, Jordan, Yau Ma Tei and Mong Kok. In October, arrivals to Hong Kong were down 43.7 per cent year on year to 3.31 million – the biggest drop since May 2003 – with more than 40 jurisdictions worldwide issuing warnings or alerts for travellers heading to the city. New cross-border transport infrastructure, such as the 55km Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and the 23km local stretch of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link would provide consistent growth in arrivals from the mainland, Euromonitor said. “Travel is resilient,” said Agilson Valle, a country manager with the company. Citing the examples of London, Paris and Istanbul – all cities that suffered terrorist attacks in 2018 and still made it onto the top 10 list –Valle said “people forget” and the outlook was positive for Hong Kong.

Meanwhile, Shenzhen dropped three places to 13th in Euromonitor’s Top 100 cities list this year, behind Istanbul (10th), New Delhi (11th) and Antalya (12th). Meanwhile, Shenzhen dropped three places to 13th in Euromonitor’s Top 100 cities list this year, behind Istanbul (10th), New Delhi (11th) and Antalya (12th). “Turkey picked up quite a lot in the number of arrivals because of the devaluation of the Turkish lira, and it became a safer place again so Europeans started going back,” Valle said. “It was more Istanbul and Antalya growing in the number of visitors, not necessarily Shenzhen losing a lot.” 	SCMP

Shi Yinhong, an international relations professor at Renmin University in Beijing, said China’s retaliation measures were mostly symbolic, but could send a warning to the NGOs.

But the present unrest is lasting longer.” Anti-government protests have escalated into violent clashes between radicals and police since June, with more than 40 jurisdictions across the globe issuing warnings or alerts for travellers heading to the city.

But he said he could at least boost the local market even during protests in the city, while there was nothing he could do in 2003. Local visitors make up between 30 and 40 per cent of the park’s customer mix, the rest being mainland Chinese and overseas travellers.  He felt a rebound would need more time. “There is a chance that tourism recovery goes slower than the period after Sars,” he said. Since 2003, an influx of mainland tourists has helped boost Hong Kong’s tourism sector quickly because of the introduction of an individual visit scheme by mainland authorities. Now, the scheme covers 49 cities.  To lure more visitors, the park planned to launch six projects by 2021. A new ride is set to be introduced before Christmas, while a new light show, called “Gala of Lights”, will kick off in January. The long-awaited HK$2.9 billion water park, known as Tai Shue Wan Water World, and a new attraction themed as “meerkat and giant tortoise” are also expected to open next year.

Post After winning 392 out of 452 seats in the November 24 polls, pan-democrats form the majority in 17 out of 18 district councils.   Democratic Party chairman Wu Chi-wai, a veteran councillor in Wong Tai Sin district who did not seek re-election, said pan-democrats must make good use of their new advantage and raise the quality of council meetings. His advice to them: “You have to raise the standard of debate and be responsible with what you say.”  One plan in that direction is to provide verbatim minutes of meetings, showing who said what. Before the election, all district councils were led by the pro-establishment camp, with some recording summaries of their proceedings without naming speakers, a practice critics said undermined accountability. Wu also said that, being consultation bodies, the councils should do more to reflect the public view on government policies.  No district council has provided live broadcasts of its meetings, with five explicitly banning those present from broadcasting proceedings using their own devices.

The administrative wing of the Central and Western District Council in 2017 estimated that it would cost several million dollars initially for equipment and installation, then another HK$60,000 to stream each meeting. “We could tailor to the need of each district council and look for a cheaper yet relatively functional set-up,” said newly elected councillor Sam Yip Kam-lung. In Kwai Tsing district, pan-democrats have arrived at an early consensus to abolish proxy votes, a change expected to be made in other districts such as Tai Po and Yau Tsim Mong too. Veteran councillor Sin Chung-kai, tipped to be chairman of Kwai Tsing district, said proxy voting was unacceptable and had been criticised by the public. It meant councillors could stay away from meetings and still have their votes recorded by authorising others to act for them. “It makes the district council meeting like a board meeting, with business decided by the heads of certain parties or among four to five people,” Sin said. Wong Tai Sin councillor Rosanda Mok Ka-han of the Democratic Party, elected for the fifth time since 1999, said her camp hopes to show its ability to govern through its reforms. “We should be able to demonstrate to the public how a mini-government works, where malpractices and white elephant projects are avoided,” Mok said.

They included the only incumbent pan-democrat in council, independent Clarisse Yeung Suet-ying, who said the project cost too much and would displace an existing volleyball court next to the Hong Kong Central Library. “It will be hard to relocate the court, which is a cradle of Hong Kong sports talents,” she said.

When it comes to broadcasting the proceedings of meetings, for example, Tse said councillors should be mindful of the cost, and whether there would be an audience large enough to justify the expense. Tse also cautioned his pan-democrat opponents, saying: “Power comes with responsibility.” 	SCMP

The Commissioner on Interception of Communications and Surveillance submitted an annual report to the Legislative Council last Wednesday which said there had been a 50 per cent rise in the number of cases of non-compliance/irregularity/incident of officers conducting wiretaps, from 18 in 2017 to 27 last year. Cases that may have involved legal professional privilege, which protects all communications between lawyers and their clients, more than doubled from 86 in 2017 to 183 last year. The number of written applications for interception of communications also increased from 1,303 in 2017 to 1,343 last year, according to the city’s surveillance watchdog. Veteran Democratic Party lawmaker James To Kun-sun said the findings were shocking. “This report shows that our privacy, human rights and right against self-incrimination protected by common law and legislation are being infringed upon, more so because surveillance happens in darkness,” To said on Monday.  “With Hongkongers’ trust in the police force at rock bottom and many arrested over recent protests, how can anyone have any faith that their cases will be handled fairly?” Police defend use of tear gas during march, blaming violent radicals 2 Dec 2019 Police defend use of tear gas during march, blaming violent radicals 2 Dec 2019 Ongoing political unrest and street demonstrations have rocked Hong Kong for almost six months. The protests, sparked by fierce opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill, have since morphed into a wider anti-government movement, focusing on calls for greater democracy and an independent investigation into police use of force. political unrest extradition bill In one surveillance case revealed in the report, a law enforcement officer dismissed a conversation that “showed a possible increase in the chance of confidential legal information being obtained”, and continued to listen in based on his belief the subject concerned was lying. Another officer made the same judgment call “based on his own experience”.  The report also slammed a number of instances in wiretaps where legal professional privilege was not preserved. The officers involved were given verbal or written warnings or transferred to a different department.  To said the report showed some officers took a cavalier approach to the rule of law. “They were given a slap on the wrist and let off the hook simply because they pleaded carelessness or workload. Officers should err on the side of protecting individuals’ privacy if they are not sure whether they can listen in,” he said. The legislator also called for tougher punishment for officers who breached the rules. “The government should amend the Interception of Communications and Surveillance Ordinance to bring in stronger sanctions, to create a cultural shift in the mentality of police officers.” 	SCMP

In addition to punitive action against officials found to be responsible for undercutting freedoms guaranteed in the Basic Law – Hong Kong's mini-constitution — the law also requires the US Secretary of State to make an annual certification that the city enjoys sufficient autonomy from the mainland to warrant maintaining the special trade status it enjoys in Washington. Trump had previously lobbied his Republican allies in the Senate to slow-walk the bill, and claimed last week that some of its provisions would “interfere” with his ability to “state the foreign policy of the United States”. But bipartisan support for the act was considered so strong in both houses of Congress that a presidential veto would have been overridden. China suspends US military visits to Hong Kong after Donald Trump signs democracy act China suspends US military visits to Hong Kong after Donald Trump signs democracy act China suspends US military visits to Hong Kong after Donald Trump signs democracy act Last week Trump also signed into law the Protect Hong Kong Act, which prohibits US companies from exporting non-lethal crowd-control munitions, including tear gas and rubber bullets, to city authorities amid allegations of disproportionate force by the city’s police. Sparked by a now-shelved extradition bill, six months of unrest in Hong Kong – and US support for the pro-democracy movement there – have become a flashpoint in bilateral tensions between Washington and Beijing, though both sides have tried to keep the issue separate from trade negotiations.  Seventeen months into their trade war, and with a further US tariff hike looming, the US and Chinese governments remain locked in talks aimed at securing an incremental agreement to defuse the dispute. Trump dodged a question on Monday about whether that “phase-one deal” would happen before the end of the year, instead pivoting to familiar messaging that Beijing was more enthusiastic about pursuing a deal than he was.  “The Chinese are always negotiating,” Trump said, speaking outside the White House before departing for a Nato summit in Britain. “I’m very happy where we are … But the Chinese want to make a deal. We’ll see what happens.” US-China trade deal in “final throes”, says Trump but we’re watching Hong Kong US-China trade deal in “final throes”, says Trump but we’re watching Hong Kong US-China trade deal in “final throes”, says Trump but we’re watching Hong Kong The US president’s remarks came hours after he announced his administration was reimposing suspended tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Argentina and Brazil, countries that have benefited from Washington’s trade war with Beijing.  Chinese importers have shunned tariff-laden soybeans from the US in favour of crops from the two South American countries. Last week, Trump bypassed Congress to send some US$20 billion in aid to farmers to offset the impact this diversion has had on rural America, with most of the funds going to states that are key for his reelection chances next year. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were initially expected to sign the phase-one deal at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) meetings in Chile in mid-November. Since the economic summit was cancelled, neither side has indicated when the leaders will meet to ink the deal, though Trump said last week that negotiators were in the “final throes” of an agreement. Adding urgency, however, is Trump’s previous declaration that on December 15, the US will impose new duties, with a round of 15 per cent tariffs on some US$156 billion of Chinese imports, including consumer goods like smartphones, laptops and toys. Hands tied by democracy act, Trump sends signal to Beijing 29 Nov 2019 Hands tied by democracy act, Trump sends signal to Beijing 29 Nov 2019 Whether or not the US administration holds back on those duties depended on “[Beijing’s] behaviour between now and then”, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Monday. Suggesting that US negotiators were not yet satisfied with what Beijing had brought to the table, Ross told Fox Business that Chinese negotiators were “making progress, but it’s one step forward, one step backward”. “We need an overall package that meets our requirements for the phase one,” he said, adding that agricultural purchases would be a prominent element in the deal, while structural issues would be largely pushed to a later phase. Global Times, a Chinese state media tabloid, reported on Saturday that Beijing sought more than just a cancellation of future tariff hikes, and viewed a rollback of all existing tariffs as a prerequisite of the agreement. Global Times In a research note on Monday, the investment consulting firm Veda put the possibility of both sides agreeing on a phase-one deal within the next two weeks at just 15 per cent. The Trump administration’s trade talks with China have proceeded as an increasingly hawkish Congress has pushed for a tougher response to Beijing’s actions on a number of non-trade fronts, including human rights. Despite the sensitivity of such matters, however, Chinese leaders have been reluctant to allow such matters to bleed into the trade talks. China hits back at democracy act by suspending US military port calls in Hong Kong 2 Dec 2019 China hits back at democracy act by suspending US military port calls in Hong Kong 2 Dec 2019 The announcement of a phase-one strategy in October, for example, came just days after the US declared a suite of sanctions against Chinese officials, government agencies and companies over their alleged involvement in human rights abuses in China’s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. In response to Trump’s signing of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, the Chinese government announced earlier on Monday that it was suspending US Navy port calls to Hong Kong and had sanctioned several US non-governmental organisations for their alleged support of pro-democracy protests in the city.

Supporters of Yuli Riswati, 39, accused the government of sending her home for reporting on the social unrest for the not-for-profit Indonesian online news outlet, Migran Pos, that she had launched in March. Migran Pos But the Immigration Department, while declining to comment on individual cases, stressed that the Hong Kong laws gave them the power to arrest, detain, prosecute and deport anyone for violating their conditions of stay. A spokesman of the department said it always dealt with cases fairly and impartially before making a decision. Thousands of protesters return to Hong Kong streets to reiterate five demands to government Thousands of protesters return to Hong Kong streets to reiterate five demands to government Thousands of protesters return to Hong Kong streets to reiterate five demands to government Fish Ip Pui-yu, a regional coordinator of the International Domestic Workers’ Federation, which has affiliates in 55 countries, said that Yuli forgot to renew her work visa, which expired in July. Immigration officers came to her flat in September and arrested her.  “During my 20 years [as an activist], I have never heard of immigration officers arresting domestic workers at their employers’ flats for expiry of their visas,” Ip said. Indonesian maid who worked in Hong Kong probed for links to Medan bombing 19 Nov 2019 Indonesian maid who worked in Hong Kong probed for links to Medan bombing 19 Nov 2019 Yuli’s lawyer, Chau Hang-tung, also said she had never heard of such an arrest, while admitting the immigration officers were legally allowed to do so. Other activists also said that the Immigration Department would always allow domestic workers to renew their passports if their employers wrote to the department supporting the renewals, even if the statements were submitted after the expiry. Yuli’s employer had done so after her visa expired.  During a court trial last month, prosecutors offered no evidence and withdrew the overstay charge against Yuli. Chau said that when Yuli paid a visit to the Kowloon Bay immigration office later that day, she was in turn sent to the Castle Peak Bay Immigration Centre. Hong Kong’s migrant domestic workers dodge tear gas and clashes Hong Kong’s migrant domestic workers dodge tear gas and clashes Hong Kong’s migrant domestic workers dodge tear gas and clashes She subsequently spent almost a month there before she was put on a flight back to Indonesia on Monday.  Ip said that last week the department told Yuli if she withdrew her visa renewal application, she would not have to face detainment any longer and could go back to Indonesia. Ip said Yuli eventually agreed to this because she had caught a cold and had been unwell. In September, Yuli, who worked in Hong Kong for about a decade, spoke to the Chinese-language newspaper Ming Pao about covering the protests.

But since the protests started, she attended the demonstrations every Sunday whenever she got a day off. She told Ming Pao that her articles were factual and did not carry her personal opinions. Ming Pao Teresa Liu Tsui-lan, managing director of the Technic Employment Service Centre, also said she had never heard of immigration officers arresting domestic workers at their homes because of visa expiry in her 30 years in the business. Abuse of foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong prompts calls for better protection Abuse of foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong prompts calls for better protection She said that as long as employers had written to the department that they wanted to re-employ a domestic worker, the department would always renew the visa. However, Liu refused to believe that Yuli was deported for writing about the protests, saying there could be other reasons not made public. Cynthia Abdon-Tellez, general manager of the Mission for Migrant Workers, an NGO, also said Yuli’s case was rare. Eman Villanueva, spokesman for the Asian Migrants’ Coordinating Body, said: “It’s not a usual practice for the department to just go to an employee’s place to arrest him or her for overstay. But at the same time, it is not impossible either, especially if the department has been informed of an overstay.” Last year, Yuli was awarded the Taiwan Literature Award for Migrants for her writing.

During an emotional interview on Monday, Veby said she was still surprised that the incident occurred. My faith tells me that I have to forgive Veby Mega Indah She was wearing her press gear that day, and was with about a dozen journalists who were well away from the protesters at the time.

Officers fired tear gas not long after a large crowd had gathered at the Tsim Sha Tsui harbourfront on Sunday afternoon for the procession from the Hong Kong Cultural Centre to Hung Hom. procession In a post on its Facebook page, the police force said “hundreds of rioters gathered near the Empire Centre, and some of them hurled smoke bombs, stirring up public fear and causing chaos”. But during a regular press briefing on Monday, Chief Superintendent Kenneth Kwok Ka-chuen of the police public relations branch was more guarded about the existence of the smoke bombs when asked about them at least four times. “The purpose of releasing updates on our social media is to give advice and warn members of the public to stay away from protest areas,” Kwok said. He said the smoke bombs had been reported by frontline officers, but when pressed again for details blamed protesters for deviating from the original route.  “They went to the Hung Hom Bypass and threw bricks and glass bottles onto the officers below. Police had no choice but to use tear gas,” he said. The use of tear gas has come under public scrutiny for its effects on health and the environment, particularly after a reporter of online news portal Stand News contracted chloracne, a skin condition caused by dioxins. It has been widely speculated tear gas releases dioxins as it burns.  Senior Superintendent Wong Wai-shun also defended the use of tear gas in crowds with elderly people and children.  “The rioters used violence with the elderly and young children in front of them. Why do people bring [their children]? Do they care about their children?” Wong said. He said people had a responsibility to leave an event when the situation got out of hand and accused protesters of having no consideration for the elderly when they destroyed traffic lights. The organiser said 380,000 people attended the march, for which police later on Sunday revoked their approval. Police estimated the size of the crowd at 16,000. The march on Sunday came after a week of relative calm and ended with protesters trashing shops with links to mainland China and setting fire to Whampoa MTR station. Police said they arrested 58 people over the weekend, including 48 men and 10 women, aged between 14 and 36, bringing the total number of arrests since the social unrest started in June to 5,947. Meanwhile, police denied pushing an elderly woman during a dispersal operation in Tsim Sha Tsui East on Sunday, saying she fell over after some bodily contact with an officer. A traffic policeman who was suspended for driving his motorcycle into protesters in Kwai Fong in November and an officer who fired a sponge grenade at a Commercial Radio reporter had both been allowed to resume duty while their cases were still being investigated, police said.

Council Front lawmakers Eddie Chu Hoi-dick and Au Nok-hin proposed reducing the maximum penalty for rioting from its current maximum of 10 years in prison to three years and bringing down the five years for unlawful assembly to six months. The introduction of the bill, which obtained the green light from the Department of Justice, came after almost 6,000 people have been arrested in almost six months of anti-government protests, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. “Society would probably not have had strong feelings had this bill been introduced last year,” Chu said on Monday. “But now they realise the Public Order Ordinance has violated human rights and been abused. It is a good opportunity to solve the problem. Passing this bill could ease the confrontation in society.”  Under the ordinance, an assembly – involving a minimum of three people – where a “breach of the peace” is committed becomes a riot and those assembled would be regarded as being “riotously assembled”. The duo proposed that there would have to be at least a dozen people who use or threaten unlawful violence “for a common purpose” for the assembly to be classified as a riot and the offence of rioting would only be tried by a jury in the Court of First Instance. A person would only be found guilty of rioting if he or she intended to use violence or was aware the conduct might be violent, according to the proposal.  Civic Party veteran Margaret Ng Ngoi-yee, a barrister by trade who also attended the press conference, said under the existing law, anyone who took part in an assembly would be “indiscriminately” regarded as taking part in a riot if there was a breach of the peace.  “Many people are aggrieved as they question why they have been charged for rioting when they have not done anything,” she said. Ng, an ex-lawmaker representing the legal sector, said the colonial ordinance was seriously out of date as it had not been reviewed since it was first enacted in 1967, while Britain had already carried out a reform, which resulted in a major change, more than 30 years ago. She also added Hongkongers were entitled to freedom of assembly under the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution, and they should not lose their rights because someone else had committed certain unlawful acts. But the two pro-democracy lawmakers, who submitted their proposal to the legislature on Monday, face an uphill battle. Under the Basic Law, the written consent of the chief executive is required to introduce a bill in the Legislative Council which “relates to public expenditure or political structure or the operation of the government”. A private member’s bill has to be passed by both Legco’s geographical and functional constituencies, with the latter dominated by the pro-establishment bloc. Pro-government camp lawmaker Paul Tse Wai-chun, a lawyer and a member of Legco’s security panel, said he understood why some might want to raise the number of people required to constitute a riot. “But we need to research the situations overseas and see what is a reasonable number,” Tse said, adding that he agreed the maximum jail term for rioting could be reviewed. He said the government might want to use lighter charges against those willing to plead guilty. He said this would allow Hong Kong courts to process the large number of cases concerning the ongoing protests more swiftly. Lawmaker Gary Chan Hak-kan, of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress for Hong Kong who chairs the security panel, had not responded to inquiries.

The government also revealed it was on course for its first budget deficit in 15 years. The Census and Statistics Department disclosed that retail sales plunged 24.3 per cent to HK$30.1 billion (US$3.86 billion) in October, year on year. For the first 10 months, the decline was 9 per cent against the same period last year. A government spokesman said it was the largest year-on-year decline for a single month on record, saying the protests had soured consumer sentiment and severely disrupted tourism. protests severely disrupted tourism “Ending the violence in the local social incidents and restoring social order are crucial to the creation of an environment for the retail business to recover,” he said. Speaking on the same day, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po delivered further bad economic news for the city.  He told a Legislative Council financial affairs panel meeting that gross domestic product (GDP) was expected to contract by 1.3 per cent for the whole financial year, with the economy buffeted by the double whammy of the US-China trade war and the anti-government protests. Mass demonstrations spurred by a since-withdrawn extradition bill have gripped the city since June, and now regularly end in violent clashes between residents and police. Radical protesters have vandalised railway stations and blocked roads, disrupting travel, and trashed shops and other businesses with links to mainland China. Radical protesters Thousands of protesters return to Hong Kong streets to reiterate five demands to government Thousands of protesters return to Hong Kong streets to reiterate five demands to government Thousands of protesters return to Hong Kong streets to reiterate five demands to government   “According to our economists’ estimate, the losses caused by the social events account for about 2 per cent of the city’s GDP.”  He forecast that Hong Kong would run a budget deficit for this financial year, for the first time since 2004-05. He explained that land sales and tax revenues had dropped while public expenditure on relief measures – helping businesses and low-income groups ride out the economic slump – had risen.

But because of the economic downturn, tax income and land sales have dropped. On top of that, we have rolled out some remedial measures, so for this financial year, the government will record a deficit – the first time in 15 years,” he said. The government has rolled out relief measures worth more than HK$21 billion (US$2.68 billion) in the past four months to mitigate the economic woes. The measures, together with sweeteners offered in the budget earlier this year, are expected to boost GDP by 2 per cent in the coming year. government has rolled out relief measures Hong Kong has already officially slipped into recession.

The social events and the violent conflicts have dealt a severe blow to Hong Kong’s economy. This is very worrying … I hope people can put an end to violence and allow society to restore order Finance chief Paul Chan Chan said the city’s unemployment rate rose to 3.1 per cent in the three months to October, from 2.9 per cent in the previous quarter. “The dining sector is the hardest hit, with a 6.1 per cent jobless rate, a new high of six years,” he said. He warned that if the violent clashes continued, people’s livelihoods would suffer further. “The social events and the violent conflicts have dealt a severe blow to Hong Kong’s economy. This is very worrying … I hope people can put an end to violence and allow society to restore order,” he said. Annie Tse Yau On-yee, chairwoman of the 9,000-member Hong Kong Retail Management Association, said the sharp drop was expected because the comparison was with a tourist boom in October last year brought by mainland China’s “golden week” National Day holiday. She noted the hardest-hit goods were luxury items such as jewellery, watches and valuable gifts, which recorded an almost 43 per cent drop in sales value, followed by footwear and clothing with a 37 per cent dip. Tse warned of a further slump in retail sales in December if the social unrest continued to plague the city. “It depends on the situation at Christmas and New Year, and whether society can restore some calm,” she said. For the whole year, Tse expected to see a single-digit percentile drop in retail sales, with the fall continuing into next year. She also called on the city’s landlords and property developers to offer more relief measures such as rent cuts for retailers as most of the association’s members had shed jobs and some had laid off staff. “Rental relief measures for struggling retailers are far from satisfactory. Some landlords only gave very small rebates on the daily rent to retailers if they were forced to close their shops because of the social unrest. For the retailers, the amount was equal to zero,” Tse said. “I appeal to the landlords and the developers to offer more rental relief measures to help their tenants ride out this difficulty. So far, we haven’t seen any sign of the social unrest easing. On the contrary, the market situation has worsened with more and more retailers shutting down.” Meanwhile, tycoon Li Ka-shing has donated HK$1 billion (US$127.5 million) to ease the plight of local small and medium-sized businesses, via his foundation. tycoon Li Ka-shing has donated HK$1 billion The Crunch Time Instant Relief Fund has received more than 43,000 applications, and the money will be distributed to about 27,000 successful applicants, who are expected to receive the funds by mid-December.

But observers said the retaliation was a calculated way to handle rising calls at home to take action against Washington without affecting ongoing trade negotiations between the two nations. The announcement from the foreign ministry that Beijing would suspend its reviews of requests made by US military aircraft and vessels came a week after US President Donald Trump signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which allows Washington to impose sanctions on officials deemed to have violated human rights in Hong Kong. “In response to the unreasonable behaviour of the US side, the Chinese government has decided to suspend reviewing the applications for US warships to go to Hong Kong for [rest and] recuperation as of today,” ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. China suspends US military visits to Hong Kong after Donald Trump signs democracy act China suspends US military visits to Hong Kong after Donald Trump signs democracy act China suspends US military visits to Hong Kong after Donald Trump signs democracy act Hua also said China had sanctioned NGOs such as Human Rights Watch for supporting violent activities in Hong Kong. Other NGOs targeted include the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the International Republican Institute and Freedom House. “There is a lot of evidence proving that these NGOs have supported anti-China forces to create chaos in Hong Kong, and encouraged them to engage in extreme violent criminal acts and ‘Hong Kong independence’ separatist activities,” she said.  “They have a large responsibility for the chaos in Hong Kong, and deserve to be sanctioned and pay the price.” China accuses G7 countries of ‘meddling’ in Hong Kong affairs 28 Aug 2019 China accuses G7 countries of ‘meddling’ in Hong Kong affairs 28 Aug 2019 Derek Mitchell, president of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, said Beijing’s claim the organisation was a “black hand” behind the months-long protests was “patently false” and an attempt to spread misinformation. Human Rights Watch said it supported human rights and the people who defended them in Hong Kong and worldwide.  It had repeatedly called on Hong Kong authorities not to use excessive or unlawful force to suppress peaceful protests and to establish an independent commission to investigate excessive use of force by the police.  “We have called on protesters and individuals who oppose them to refrain from violence. We have also repeatedly called on the Chinese central government, as well as the Hong Kong government, to fulfil the Hong Kong people’s rights to vote and to stand for elections,” the group said. “Rather than target an organisation that seeks to defend the rights of the people of Hong Kong, the Chinese government should respect those rights.” China, Joshua Wong and former Hong Kong leader CY Leung react to US passing Hong Kong democracy bill China, Joshua Wong and former Hong Kong leader CY Leung react to US passing Hong Kong democracy bill China, Joshua Wong and former Hong Kong leader CY Leung react to US passing Hong Kong democracy bill On Monday, China called on the US to stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs, Hua said, adding that Beijing could take further action to protect its national sovereignty and security. Beijing said last week that it would take strong countermeasures against Washington, and accused the US of interfering in Hong Kong. strong countermeasures against Washington Tension between the two countries has risen since June, when mass protests erupted in Hong Kong against a now-withdrawn extradition bill. US officials and politicians accused Hong Kong police of brutality against protesters and demanded Beijing ensure the autonomy of the city, prompting Beijing to accuse Washington of gross interference in its internal affairs. These organisations have always been sensitive and unpopular in terms of the mainland. To call them out is more like a warning, acknowledging that these organisations and their positions on Hong Kong have crossed the line Liu Weidong, a US affairs specialist from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Trump had said he had asked Chinese President Xi Jinping not to send in troops to Hong Kong, otherwise Hong Kong would have been “obliterated in 14 minutes”. The US president also signed the Protect Hong Kong Act into law, prohibiting the sale of US-made munitions such as tear gas and rubber bullets to the city’s authorities. “I signed these bills out of respect for President Xi, China and the people of Hong Kong,” Trump said. “They are being enacted in the hope that leaders and representatives of China and Hong Kong will be able to amicably settle their differences leading to long-term peace and prosperity for all.” The moves come as China and the US try to negotiate a “phase one” trade deal, with China insisting that US tariffs be rolled back as part of the agreement, according to Chinese state media. China and the US try to negotiate a “phase one” trade deal A new batch of US tariffs on Chinese imports is due to go into effect on December 15, putting an extra 15 per cent duty on US$156 billion worth of Chinese goods. China has said it will impose another round of tariffs on US$75 billion worth of US goods – including soybeans – on December 15, in line with the US schedule. Liu Weidong, a US affairs specialist from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the measures announced on Monday were a gesture and would not have a big impact on the US and the affected NGOs.

To call them out is more like a warning, acknowledging that these organisations and their positions on Hong Kong have crossed the line,” Liu said. He also said China’s options were limited because it was trying to stop the signing of the laws from affecting other aspects of the relationship with the US, such as the trade war.

However, in August, China rejected requests for Hong Kong port visits by the amphibious transport dock USS Green Bay and the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Erie as US lawmakers criticised the Hong Kong police force’s handling of the protests. In September last year, Beijing also refused a port call by the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp just days after Washington sanctioned the Chinese military over arms purchases from Russia. Nevertheless, defence chiefs from both countries have pledged to make military ties the “stabiliser” of China-US relations. the “stabiliser” of China-US relations A retired Chinese major general familiar with military relations with the US said the ministry’s announcement was a diplomatic measure rather than an effort to damage military ties. “The American vessels and military aircraft make port calls to Hong Kong because they need to restock, which is a commercial and diplomatic act,” he said. “It was not a military measure carried out by the defence ministry … but a purely diplomatic response [to Washington’s intervention in Hong Kong].” Another Beijing-based military insider agreed that the suspension would not harm military-to-military relations. “Suspended port calls is the mildest response to the US’ intervention on the Hong Kong issue. It won’t have any negative impact on China-US military exchanges,” he said, adding that the vessels could still stop in other countries in the region including Singapore and the Philippines. “Beijing is taking the action to vent public anger at home over Trump’s signing of the Hong Kong bill.” In the Hong Kong entertainment area of Wan Chai district, bar owners said they expected less business in the coming months because of the suspension.

Fewer customers would definitely pose more harm to the already disturbed businesses. We are also worried that tourists are not coming to town.” Additional reporting by Kinling Lo and Lilian Cheng Additional reporting by Kinling Lo and Lilian Cheng 	SCMP

The organisers of the lunchtime gathering in Chater Garden, from a group called Advertising Civilians, vowed to strike from Monday to Friday, and use the time – and their professional skills – to help spread the word about the “yellow economy” of pro-democracy shops and restaurants, with free work on advertising and promotion. Yellow is a symbolic colour of the city’s pro-democracy movement. The group said it hoped to encourage similar action from other industries. Anthony Yiu Koon-tung, a spokesman for the event, who has been in the industry for 20 years, said they hoped the action would bond advertising workers and allow them to “let each other know they are not alone” in the movement. Thousands of protesters return to Hong Kong streets to reiterate five demands to government Thousands of protesters return to Hong Kong streets to reiterate five demands to government Thousands of protesters return to Hong Kong streets to reiterate five demands to government “Many young people in the industry have been arrested and injured,” Yiu said. “Those who are in the industry have not been participating enough in the movement by assisting the design of promotional materials and leaflets. We hope such an event can raise the awareness of everyone in the field.” Of 960 advertising workers polled in an internal survey by the group, 96 per cent backed the strike, with 89 per cent saying they would participate. Government statistics from 2017 showed that 19,000 people worked in the industry, excluding freelancers.  A 30-year-old man specialising in tech advertising, who attended the rally and only gave his name as Cipriano, said that, though the strike might mean him earning less for the month, he had done the right thing by joining. “I had thought the district council elections might calm things down,” he said, referring to citywide polls last week in which the pro-democracy camp scored a landslide victory. “But obviously it hasn’t, as many more came out on Sunday.” citywide polls last week Man attacked with drain cover while clearing protest roadblock in Hong Kong 3 Dec 2019 Man attacked with drain cover while clearing protest roadblock in Hong Kong 3 Dec 2019 Tens of thousands of protesters returned to the streets of Tsim Sha Tsui in a peaceful march on Sunday, which eventually descended into sporadic clashes with police. returned to the streets of Tsim Sha Tsui in a peaceful march on Sunday  Designer Abaddon was among the advertising workers who had created artworks for “Lennon Walls” – improvised murals across the city, bearing messages in support of the protests.  “I was angry after joining every peaceful protest since June, due to the unresponsive attitude of the government. I have since stopped working, to join the movement fully,” he told the crowd. The unprecedented social unrest, triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill six months ago, has morphed into a wider movement calling for police accountability and greater democracy. There are no consequences for the police officers who use excessive force at protests Soda Fan, protester Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has so far addressed just one of the protesters’ five demands by withdrawing the unpopular bill. She has dismissed the rest, including an independent probe into police handling of protests and the implementation of universal suffrage. Monday’s rally started with a minute’s silence for people who had died during the movement. Some in attendance held placards which read: “If the adults were willing to go on strike, students would not have to clash [with police].” Advertising Civilians later estimated 1,500 people had attended the rally. Soda Fan, 30, who works for digital agencies, said he would not accept new clients this week. His current clients might be affected, he said, but he added that going on strike was one thing he could do to support the protests. “There are no consequences for the police officers who use excessive force at protests,” he said. “The first thing the new police commissioner Chris Tang Ping-keung did was encourage and endorse what the force did. This was totally unacceptable.” A 27-year-old industry worker who only gave her name as Ella said that about 10 of her colleagues were at the rally with her. She said the company she works for accepted their participation, because it was not likely to delay their work too much. Meanwhile, dozens of office workers, many in face masks, launched lunchtime protests in Cheung Sha Wan and Tai Koo. About 40 people gathered outside the One Island East building in Tai Koo, chanting: “Five demands, not one less.” Among them was office worker Man Ng, 40, who said he was “speechless” that the government had still refused to satisfy all five demands.

Lam Tai-fai, council chairman of Polytechnic University, made his comments after a 13-day police siege of the campus ended on Friday. PolyU is expected to announce an estimate of its losses next week, and Lam said it aimed to resume classes in mid-January. “The loss of hardware can be resolved by money,” Lam told a radio programme on Monday. “But we are very worried that we cannot measure the loss in our research. We also don’t know whether it can be carried out again.” He said the suspension of some research projects, which were being carried out in university labs, might result in inaccurate findings. “The mice [in the laboratories] didn’t eat in the past week, what will happen? They are used for research,” he said. “If they have been starved for a week, will the research be affected?”  However, when approached by the Post, Lam said he did not know further details of research projects that had been affected. Post Police surrounded the institution and stopped any frontline radicals from leaving without facing arrest on November 17, after one of the most intense and fiery battles in more than five months of anti-government protests. The demonstrations were triggered by opposition to a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed the transfer of suspects to mainland China.  During the two-week stand-off, campus facilities were wrecked and laboratories broken into. Using chemicals and fuel they had collected, protesters made petrol bombs and other explosive and corrosive items. So far, police have found about 4,000 petrol bombs. Hong Kong universities need to consider restricting entry: education minister 30 Nov 2019 Hong Kong universities need to consider restricting entry: education minister 30 Nov 2019 Lam said many labs were damaged and chemicals stolen, and added that repairs to the university were not simply a matter of clearing rubbish and replacing smashed glass.  “We are not sure whether there are any structural problems with glass [in the campus] … whether there are any leaks of electricity and water, and any concerns over gas supply and the quality of water and air,” he said.  Hong Kong's PolyU siege : From beginning to end Hong Kong's PolyU siege : From beginning to end Hong Kong's PolyU siege : From beginning to end Among more than 1,100 people arrested after leaving the site, only 46 were registered students at the university, according to police. “We are really innocent,” Lam said. “We know clearly that the target of the attack was not Polytechnic University or staff and students of the university, but the government,” he said. “Because of the government’s administration and governance, and its relationship with the public, we became a scapegoat. “It would be unreasonable if we had to bear all these costs.” Education sector lawmaker Ip Kin-yuen agreed that it would be logical for the government to bear most of the repair costs. “[The damage] this time was caused by confrontations, which were prompted by mistakes of government measures and clashes between police and civilians,” Ip said. “That was not something the university could control.” He said the government should also bear the costs of repairs at other universities which suffered damage amid protests over the past few months. City University revealed on Saturday that repairs and restoration of facilities would cost a nine-digit figure. It was the first of six universities which were damaged during recent anti-government protests to provide an estimate of such costs in a public statement. 	SCMP

They are calling on British voters in Raab’s constituency of Esher and Walton to support his rival Monica Harding, following a ﻿Sunday Times report that he was blocking a Home Office initiative to “allow victims of state repression and violence in Hong Kong to flee to the UK” because he feared antagonising Beijing. Sunday Times Harding, who trails Raab by a small margin ahead of the December 12 election, is a member of the Liberal Democrats, whose manifesto calls for British National (Overseas) passport holders to be granted full British citizenship amid months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong.

British National (Overseas) Why some Hongkongers are taking a fresh look at their British National (Overseas) passports Why some Hongkongers are taking a fresh look at their British National (Overseas) passports Why some Hongkongers are taking a fresh look at their British National (Overseas) passports The Hongkongers accused the foreign secretary of “siding with an authoritarian state rather than freedom fighters” and insisted their action would not constitute interference in foreign politics, “because BN(O) holders residing in the UK are legally eligible to vote, and Raab’s decision bears a direct impact on our fate”, according to one of the group who spoke on condition of anonymity. Make Hongkongers with BN(O)s full British citizens, Boris Johnson is urged 22 Nov 2019 Make Hongkongers with BN(O)s full British citizens, Boris Johnson is urged 22 Nov 2019 Luke de Pulford, a member of the Conservative Party’s human rights committee and a vocal advocate for Hong Kong protesters, said he was in regular contact with “hundreds of UK-based activists … They feel betrayed by the UK, and they are profoundly upset by reports that Raab has blocked a ‘lifeboat’ policy for BN(O) passport holders [and] many have decided to campaign for Raab’s constituency rival”. He called on Raab to change his stance on BN(O) passports lest he lose his seat in an election that Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes will secure a majority to get his Brexit deal passed.  “As a lifelong Conservative, I hope the foreign secretary has a rapid rethink – not simply because he may lose his seat if he does not, but because helping BN(O)s is a matter of justice,” he said.   Calls for action were also posted on LIHKG, the online platform popular among Hongkongers sympathetic to the protesters. Some, though, voiced concern over the strategy, saying: “Should we burn bridges with Tories when they are forecast to win a majority?” Hong Kong Watch, a London-based advocacy group on the former colony’s human rights situation, said: “BN(O) passports are a historic injustice. [Raab] should not block the change at a time when these British Nationals need a safety net.” Hong Kong Watch, a London-based advocacy group on the former colony’s human rights situation, said: “BN(O) passports are a historic injustice.

It was issued to those born before the 1997 handover of the former British colony to China. Hong Kong activists based in Britain are some of the most active among their global peers, organising marches around London which have sometimes been interrupted by nationalist-minded migrants from mainland China. Last month, they confronted visiting Hong Kong Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah, who fell and injured her arm during the encounter in central London. who fell and injured her arm  Raab in September told the British Parliament that any changes to the status of BN(O) passport holders risked upsetting the Sino-British Joint Declaration. But, according to The Sunday Times, Home Secretary Priti Patel’s team proposed a “quick fix” to help those seeking to escape Hong Kong. The Sunday Times  The British newspaper said Raab objected to Patel’s proposal on the grounds it could anger Beijing and disrupt the “one country, two systems” governing Hong Kong. The Foreign Office described the newspaper report as a “wrong story”, adding that Raab was coordinating what it called “cross-Whitehall contingency planning in relation to Hong Kong”. China has repeatedly criticised suggestions of any official changes to BN(O) status, as foreign interference in the domestic issue of Hong Kong. It has also called the Sino-British Joint Declaration between British prime minister Margaret Thatcher and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in 1984 an “historical document that is no longer valid”. 	SCMP
