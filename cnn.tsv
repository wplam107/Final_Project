On Wednesday, Hong Kong's flagship airline posted a 28% plunge in profit in 2019 compared to the previous year. The last six months of 2019 wiped away what the company described as a strong start to the year as the airline was hit by fallout from the Hong Kong protests, which scared away tourists, damaged the city's economy and prompted an internal and external crisis of confidence. Cathay Pacific became a casualty of Hong Kong's political crisis last summer, as it threatened staff with termination if they took part in illegal pro-democracy protests and later also lost its CEO and chief commercial officer. ""2019 was very much a year of two halves,"" Cathay chairman Patrick Healy told reporters on Wednesday. The carrier is now dealing with another blow as global travel slumps due to the coronavirus pandemic. Cathay has already significantly shrunk capacity in recent months, cutting flights by 30% in February and 65% in March and April. The company now says that more reductions are expected in May as it continues to monitor demand. ""We expect to incur a substantial loss for the first half of 2020,"" Healy said. ""The scale of the challenge we currently face is unprecedented."" The airline is now asking all vendors and business partners ""for relief in the form of deferrals and discounts, to help us preserve cash,"" the chairman added. Cathay is talking to Airbus (EADSF) about deferring aircraft deliveries scheduled for later this year, said Ronald Lam, Cathay's chief customer and commercial officer. It is also talking to aircraft leasing providers, he added. The airline has already asked its 27,000 staff members to consider taking three weeks off without pay. So far, 80% of staff have already volunteered for unpaid leave, according to the company. For now, however, slashing flights is the best way to save money, executives said. ""The single most cash preserving action we can take is to cut capacity to match the demand we're seeing in the market,"" said Healy. ""Beyond that, of course we are constantly reviewing all discretionary spend and cutting back or deferring wherever possible."" Cathay stock closed up 3% in Hong Kong. The airline's shares have dropped nearly 12% so far this year. "	CNN

That means tens of thousands of airline workers will probably soon be out of work, at least temporarily. Airlines are already adjusting its staffing by asking employees to take vacation at reduced pay or unpaid leaves of absence. So far, airlines' job cuts have not been permanent. But some companies have frozen hiring, which could hurt airlines' abilities to fill jobs they need filled once the crisis passes. ""Every airline will have to look at doing something like this,"" said airline consultant Michael Boyd. ""It's just good, solid planning."" Hong Kong-based carrier Cathay Pacific is the most extreme example so far: It temporarily cut flights by 40%, and it asked all 33,000 of its employees to voluntarily sign up for three-week unpaid leave sometime before the end of June. Cathay had already been struggling before the virus surfaced because of the Hong Kong protests last year. ""Preserving cash is the key to protecting our business,"" Cathay said in a statement last month. ""We have already been taking multiple measures to achieve this."" Cathay would not say how many employees had signed up for the leave that it says is voluntary. Lufthansa, which Friday announced a 50% drop in capacity it the coming weeks, said it is talks with its unions about the way to avoid layoffs including reduced hours for staff. It was already having employees take unpaid leave. Dubai-based Emirates, which like Cathay is also completely dependent on international travel, has similarly urged employees to take a leave of absence. ""The knock on effect of these operational changes has resulted in more resources than required in certain areas of the business for our day to day requirements,"" said the airline in a statement. It said it wants to protect its workforce and limit the impact of the outbreak, but it will allow employees to take ""voluntary unpaid leave"" for up to one month at a time. Earlier this week, United Airlines (UAL) and JetBlue (JBLU) both announced cuts in their schedules because of sharply lower demand, and both said they would adjust staffing levels. United, which cut overseas flights by 20% and domestic and Canadian flights by 10%, said employees could request voluntary unpaid leave or reduced schedules, and it would freeze hiring. A class of 23 pilots that was set to start work at United this week has not yet been assigned roles. United, which recently opened an academy to train the pilots it needs, said it still expects to hire 10,000 pilots over the course of this decade. JetBlue, which cut its overall schedule by 5%, said it is ""reducing hiring for both frontline and support center positions, considering voluntary time off programs as appropriate, and limiting non-essential spending."" There are 2.95 million airline employees worldwide, according to the International Air Transport Association. About 462,000 of those are in the United States, the US Labor Department says. So even a 5% drop in airline employment would result in about 150,000 lost jobs worldwide, and more than 20,000 in the United States. US airlines cut 62,000 jobs in the three months following 9/11, representing 11% of the industry's employment at that time. But that depth of cuts isn't as likely to occur during the coronavirus outbreak, even if traffic falls by as much, because airlines today have much leaner staffing that they did in 2001, said Boyd. The drop in employment levels probably won't match the drop in capacity at most airlines, he said. ""You can't just cut 10% of staff when you cut 10% of flights,"" he said. ""Instead of working eight flights on a shift, a gate agent or baggage handler may work six flights. But it's still a full shift."" "	CNN

But publishers have seized on it for a different reason: They're posting explainers and fact-checks pegged to the news. Sometimes they're dancing too — all in the name of courting the next generation of news consumers. ""We wanted to be a part of the dance trends and the feel good moments and build up an audience and then start to insert the news more often,"" Alex Ptachick, USA Today's audience editor of emerging platforms, told CNN Business. ""That does not mean we're going to stop also having fun and being funny."" TikTok, which rebranded from Musical.ly in August 2018, has piqued the interest of several media companies looking to appeal to the app's young and engaged audience. NBC News, ESPN, iHeartRadio and The Dodo began experimenting with TikTok in early 2019. The Washington Post launched its account in May. NowThis joined in December. TikTok famously helped Lil Nas X's ""Old Town Road"" break Billboard records and has ushered in a new class of internet celebrities. It has been downloaded more than 1.5 billion times, according to app analytics site Sensor Tower. The app boasts a young audience with 69% of its users between the ages of 16 and 24 years old, according to the company. ""We want to meet our young audience where they are, and it's clear that there's a huge young audience on this platform. We want to be telling compelling stories for them,"" said Nico Pitney, news and politics director of NowThis. USA Today launched its TikTok account in November with light-hearted videos that are paired with music to provide a behind-the-scenes look at its newsroom and other cute moments. In January, the staff decided to test something else. At that time, opening TikTok may have led some to believe the United States had started World War III after President Trump approved a drone strike that killed Iran's top commander. One TikTok video that has amassed 2.2 million views features a young woman looking into the camera with overlay text that said, ""So everyone's talking about getting pregnant to avoid the WWIII draft but no one's realized that it means we'll be creating another set of boomers."" Another that has 1.4 million views said, ""Perks of being drafted in WW3, no school, traveling, free delicious food, a new fit."" Of course, there is no draft. TikTok users were simply using the app to create and share memes about the US-Iran conflict. But Ptachick and her three-person team saw an opportunity. ""We were messaging back and forth like, 'Oh God, I'm seeing like people are saying we're at war. People are talking about being drafted. What can we do to get the actual news out there?'"" Ptachick said. On January 6, USA Today posted a TikTok video with a caption that said, ""Tension between the U.S. and Iran is escalating. Here's what you need to know."" Rather than pop music and dancing, the video featured a voiceover and still images. With just over 50,000 views, the video is less popular than many of USA Today's other posts and amassed less views than the viral draft posts. But comments on the video like ""More content like this please! ""Thanks for the info"" and ""thank you"" has motivated the publisher to share more news on TikTok. Ptachick and her team have since posted two videos about the Australian wildfires — one generating 63,000 views and the other 31,200. TikTok categorizes itself as an entertainment app and users have likened it to ""therapy"" because of the comic relief it provides. But teens have also used it to talk about serious topics like school shootings and climate change. Publishers have engaged with the app in similar ways, dancing in some videos and explaining newsworthy issues in others. NowThis, for example, has created videos about President Trump's impeachment and Australia's bushfires. The impeachment video features a hand placing paper cutouts of major players like Hunter Biden and bags of money on a table with a narrator explaining the timeline of events. The bushfire video features an infographic with dots filling a map of Australia to show the spread of the fire. It was set to the song ""All Time Low"" by Jon Bellion. ""Our audience cares about issues, they care about policies,"" Pitney said. ""We're explaining complex issues to news consumers who are just sort of finding their political awareness."" TikTok appears to be facing less issues with misinformation and disinformation than Facebook and Twitter. But it's not free from it. Slate detailed in a report the ""three types of scams"" that have emerged on TikTok. The Beijing-backed company has been accused of using Chinese-style censorship tactics to hide information about the Hong Kong protests, Tiananmen Square massacre and Tibetan independence. The company told The Guardian that those ""old guidelines in question are outdated and no longer in use."" Bloomberg reported earlier this month that TikTok is struggling to combat accounts that impersonate world leaders. Last week, TikTok revised its community guidelines to address misinformation and misleading content on the app. ""We believe that feeling safe is essential to helping people feel comfortable with expressing themselves openly and creatively. We also aim to cultivate an environment for authentic interactions by keeping deceptive content and accounts off our platform,"" the rules read. 'Nothing seems to be off limits on TikTok.' TikTok is a constant presence in high schools. Jonathan Rogers, a journalism teacher at Iowa City High School, learned of the app while he was teaching at a journalism camp last summer. He describes the app as a ""lunchroom atmosphere where teens are making jokes about anything in funny video and meme form."" In August, his students created an account for their school newspaper. ""Nothing seems to be off limits on TikTok,"" Rogers said. Rogers said his students use humor in TikTok videos to process what is happening in the world around them. ""They don't think they're misinformed, just uninformed,"" he said. That's where some publishers see an opportunity. MediaWise, Poynter's project focused on teen media literacy, created a TikTok account for promotion and to ""combat misinformation,"" said Katy Byron, MediaWise's editor and program manager. Similar to USA Today, MediaWise created a video in response to WWIII memes. The focus was on fact-checking information about a draft, rather than explaining the US-Iran conflict. It's received 1,130 views so far. ""My first year at college was the 9/11 attacks and everyone was talking about, 'Was there a draft?'""Byron said. ""That's just human nature, but it's taking on a new virality because of these social platforms, spreading like wildfire."" TikTok has considered creating a curated feed of content from reputable sources, including news outlets. The FT reported Tuesday that it would be similar to Snapchat Discover, which features videos from vetted creators and professional publishers and could provide a safe space for brands, especially ones that are skittish about advertising next to user-generated content. ""Publishers are turning to TikTok to reach broader audiences and build a brand around their content, and we look forward to continuing to work with them as this community grows,"" a TikTok spokesperson told CNN Business. ""We're always thinking about ways to both allow our brand partners to reach consumers in new and innovative ways and enable new revenue sources for our creators and publishing partners."" Ptachick of USA Today told CNN Business her team has been in ""regular communication"" with TikTok on best practices and other advice for growing their account. Pitney of NowThis said his team hasn't spoken with TikTok, but they do receive a weekly email about trending hashtags. The Washington Post's Dave Jorgenson, who serves as both a video journalist for the paper and as the face of the company's TikTok account, employs humor, stunts and sketches to give viewers a glimpse of life inside the newsroom. Sometimes the videos are pegged to the news. For example, a recent video tied to Oscar nominations is a play on a scene from the movie ""Joker,"" which was nominated for 11 Academy Awards on Monday. But Jorgenson expressed reluctance over incorporating too much news in the Washington Post's TikTok because he sees it as ""a bit of an escape from the news."" ""Not that you should be ignoring the news, but I don't want to show up on TikTok — the fun dinner party — and they're all happy and just completely destroy it,"" he told CNN Business. Jorgenson does, however, reply to comments with facts gleaned from the news. In the ""Joker"" TikTok, he wrote that no women were nominated for Best Director and that ""Joker"" received the most nominations this year. ""If [the audience] is asking about something, I will do my best to actually reply about whatever they're asking about,"" Jorgenson said. ""If I can find a TikTok that fits within what people are talking about on TikTok that also is related to the news, I will do that, but I never want to force it in with what already is trending on TikTok.""

Kenneth Roth, the group's executive director, said he was barred from entering the Chinese territory upon landing at the city's international airport on Sunday, with no reason given by immigration authorities. ""I had hoped to spotlight Beijing's deepening assault on international efforts to uphold human rights,"" Roth said in a statement on the group's website. ""The refusal to let me enter Hong Kong vividly illustrates the problem,"" he said. The Hong Kong Immigration Department declined to comment on individual cases. In a short statement to CNN, it said the department considers ""all relevant factors and circumstances of the case before deciding whether the entry should be allowed or not.""  Hong Kong is in the midst of a months-long anti-government protest movement that calls for greater democracy and police accountability. Mass demonstrations have at times turned violent as police fired tear gas and forcibly arrested protesters they accused of rioting and vandalism. Demonstrators have accused the police of using excessive force. Roth, a US citizen who had freely entered Hong Kong before, said he had hoped to release Human Rights Watch's World Report 2020 at the city's Foreign Correspondents' Club on Wednesday. The report, which reviews human rights practices in nearly 100 countries, is led by Roth's introductory essay that warns the Chinese government is carrying out an intensive attack on the global system for enforcing human rights. Following the alleged denial of entry, Roth boarded a plane back to New York, where he will launch the report at the United Nations on Tuesday. ""I suppose I should be grateful to Hong Kong immigration authorities for this shoot-yourself-in-the-foot publicity for (Human Rights Watch's) World Report release,"" he said in a post on his Twitter account. The semi-autonomous city has denied entry to a string of activists, foreign journalists and a US academic in recent years, drawing criticism at home and abroad for what some fear is an increasingly authoritarian approach in dealing with voices of dissent. ""This disappointing action is yet another sign that Beijing is tightening its oppressive grip on Hong Kong and further restricting the limited freedom Hong Kong people enjoy under 'one country, two systems,'"" Roth said, referring to the arrangement under which the former British colony was returned to Beijing's rule. Beijing has repeatedly denied interference and accused ""foreign forces,"" including the US and the UK, as ""black hands"" behind the social unrest in Hong Kong. Based in New York, Human Rights Watch was one of several US-based non-government organizations which the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had threatened to impose ""sanctions"" against in December. They include the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democractic Institute for International Affairs, the International Republican Institute and Freedom House. The groups, which had been monitoring and reporting on the protests in Hong Kong, was accused by Beijing of supporting ""anti-China"" people. It said they were instigating protesters ""engaging in extreme crimes"" in pursuit of Hong Kong's separation from China. HRW's criticism of China goes far beyond the Hong Kong protests. The group said fundamental rights and freedoms are ""increasingly at jeopardy as Beijing seeks to broaden its repression globally."" "	CNN

Researchers from the University of Hong Kong surveyed 18,000 people between 2009 and 2019 in what they said was the world's largest and longest study of the population-wide impact of social unrest on mental health. Of those surveyed, 32% reported signs of PTSD in recent months, according to the researchers. PTSD is an anxiety disorder that manifests after a traumatic experience and can cause sleeplessness, irritability and traumatic nightmares. Protests erupted in Hong Kong in June over a now-scrapped extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China. The demonstrations have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement calling for greater civil liberties and police accountability. As the protests have continued, they have grown more violent and disruptive. Two protesters have been shot with live rounds, a man was set on fire, and another man died after being hit with a brick during clashes. More than 16,000 rounds of tear gas have been fired by police, with about 7,000 people arrested. Of Hong Kong's 7.5 million population, 6.3 million are adults. Compared to 2009, when the research began, the study found there are now an estimated 1.9 million more adults in the city with PTSD symptoms, and 590,000 more with probable depression. ""Hong Kong is under-resourced to deal with this excess mental health burden,"" Professor Gabriel Leung from the University of Hong Kong, who co-led the research, said in statement. ""With only around half the per-capita psychiatry capacity of the UK, and pre-existing average public sector outpatient waiting times of up to 64 weeks, it is important that we enhance mental health and social care provision so that all those in need are able to access high-quality services."" According to the study, the prevalence of PTSD symptoms in the adult population was six times higher in 2019 than after the city's so-called Umbrella Movement -- a 79-day, largely peaceful civil disobedience campaign calling for universal suffrage -- rising from about 5% in March 2015 to nearly 32% in September to November 2019. They acknowledged that their findings provide observational associations rather than prove any cause and effect. They also warned that their findings may underestimate the extent of mental health problems because they did not include individuals younger than 18, who make up a substantial proportion of protesters.

Protesters in the former British colony attacked some branches of HSBC (HBCYF) this week and daubed red paint on a pair of bronze lions outside the bank's Hong Kong headquarters. HSBC, the largest bank in the city, has been accused of working with Chinese authorities to cut off funding for the protesters. HSBC has denied those allegations and condemned what it described as repeated ""acts of vandalism"" against its branches. It said in a statement on Thursday that it was working to restore ATM and other banking services that had been suspended as a result of the attacks. Meanwhile, the London Stock Exchange (LDNXF) is at risk of losing Chinese business because of Beijing's anger at Britain's stance on the protests in Hong Kong. Citing multiple sources, Reuters reported that a partnership between the London and Shanghai stock exchanges was being suspended because of political tension. Neither the exchanges, nor Chinese financial regulators, responded to requests for comment. The Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates UK financial markets, declined to comment. Rising tension with Beijing comes as Britain looks to build stronger commercial ties with countries such as China and the United States as it prepares to leave the European Union. Brexit will take place at the end of this month but a huge cloud of uncertainty still hangs over the future of trade between Britain and its biggest export market. Financial services are central to the UK economy, accounting for 13% of all exports and providing over 1 million jobs. The link between the London and Shanghai exchanges was first announced in 2015. It allows UK-listed companies to sell shares in China and permits Chinese companies to raise money on the UK market, giving them access to a bigger pool of international investors. Until late December, HSBC had largely escaped the vandalism directed against some Chinese bank branches during the Hong Kong protests, such as those owned by the Bank of China (BACHF). But Britain's biggest bank has been targeted in recent weeks after it closed an account in November held by the Spark Alliance, a nonprofit group in Hong Kong raising funds for the protests. Protesters accused the bank of helping the police with an investigation into suspected money laundering, which led to the arrest of some Spark Alliance members on December 19. HSBC said that the closure of the account was ""completely unrelated"" to the arrests or the situation in Hong Kong, and was carried out in keeping with global regulations that require banks to conduct regular ""due diligence"" reviews on customer accounts. ""As the account has not been used for its stated purpose, we closed the account in November 2019 following fund transfer instruction from the customer,"" it said in a statement on December 25. HSBC, which was established in Hong Kong in 1865, derived half of its pretax profits from business in Asia's premier financial hub in the first nine months of last year. — Charles Riley, Yong Xiong, and Steven Jiang contributed to the report.

A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. We start the new year with three developments out of China. Beijing flexes its muscle: China has halted planned cross-border listings between Shanghai and the London Stock Exchange because of political tensions with the United Kingdom, according to Reuters. The suspension of the Shanghai-London Stock Connect is the latest example of fallout related to the Hong Kong protests to hit companies that are exposed to China. According to Reuters, politics was behind the suspension of the stock connect mechanism, which has been touted as an important step in the opening up of China's capital markets. The suspension comes just weeks before the United Kingdom will leave the European Union, a departure that makes the country's relationships with big economies such as the United States and China even more important. The episode highlights the tough choices facing Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he seeks to negotiate new trade deals that are needed to boost Britain's stagnant economy. HSBC targeted: Pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong attacked HSBC (HBCYF) branches on the first day of the new year and vandalized a pair of bronze lions outside the bank's headquarters in the city. Protesters accuse the bank of colluding with authorities and frustrating efforts to fund the demonstrations. At issue is the closure of an HSBC account held by a nonprofit group raising funds for the protests, and the subsequent arrest of four of its members on money laundering allegations. The bank said in a statement last month that the account closure was ""completely unrelated"" to the arrests. On Wednesday, it condemned the ""repeated"" vandalism of its branches. HSBC was established in Hong Kong in 1865, and is the biggest bank in the financial hub. But like many other global companies that use Hong Kong as a base, it does a huge amount of business in mainland China. Other companies to come under pressure from the Hong Kong protests include Cathay Pacific (CPCAY), Disney (DIS), Prada (PRDSY) and Swatch (SWGAF). Central bank acts: The People's Bank of China has moved to stimulate the country's economy, giving banks the green light to increase lending by roughly $115 billion. The PBOC on Wednesday announced a relatively small reduction in the amount of capital banks are required to keep in reserve, freeing up additional money ahead of Chinese New Year, when demand for cash increases due to holiday gift giving. China's economy is growing at the slowest pace in decades, and the country's central bank made a series of adjustments last year aimed at stabilizing growth amid the fallout from the trade war with the United States. Economists expect the country's central bank to continue to act. Among the possible moves: another cut to the reserve requirement ratio, or an interest rate cut. The latest on Carlos Ghosn's great escape Japanese authorities have raided the house where fugitive auto executive Carlos Ghosn was staying before he escaped to Lebanon earlier this week, possibly via Turkey. The latest: Local media reported that Tokyo district prosecutors entered the property where Ghosn had been living on Thursday.
CNN affiliate TV Asahi said that prosecutors were working with police to access CCTV video around his home as part of their investigation.
Turkish state media reported that seven people have been detained on suspicion of helping Ghosn flee to Lebanon. Police have reportedly detained four pilots of a private airline, two ground staff and the director of a cargo company. Bottom line: It is still not clear how Ghosn, who is a citizen of France, Brazil and Lebanon, was able to slip out of Japan, where he was awaiting trial on charges of financial misconduct. It's very unlikely that Ghosn will be returning to Japan because the country does not have an extradition treaty with Lebanon, where the former Nissan and Renault boss spent his childhood and enjoys popular support. The implications: ""No matter what [Japan does] now, it is very difficult to overcome the embarrassment of letting go one of the most high-profile suspects"" of corporate scandal since World War II, said Keith Henry, the founder of Asia Strategy, a research and policy firm based in Tokyo. Warren Buffett sticks to his guns According to the Financial Times, Tiffany & Co. (TIF) approached Warren Buffett about making a potential bid after the US company received an offer from luxury giant LVMH (LVMHF). But the Berkshire Hathaway boss rejected Tiffany's advances. Why? He thought the asking price was too steep, according to the FT. Buffett has lamented the fact that valuations for many companies have become prohibitively expensive given that the stock market keeps hitting new record highs. And he has continuously stressed that he won't overpay for deals. Yet Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) is now sitting on $128 billion in cash. And Buffett wrote in the company's annual shareholder letter in February that he hopes to make ""an elephant-sized acquisition."" There was intermittent chatter last year that Berkshire may be interested in struggling California utility PG&E, and there were rumors that Buffett may want to buy a major US airline, such as Southwest (LUV). Berkshire already owns shares in Southwest, as well as Delta (DAL), American (AAL) and United (UAL). For now, though, it looks like Buffett will continue to resist the urge to splash out. "	CNN

Here are some of the most fascinating news stories that shaped the decade	"(CNN)When the clock strikes midnight on January 1, an unparalleled decade comes to a close: one that saw everything from NASA's first all-female spacewalk to the aftermath of natural disasters and the death of Osama bin Laden. There were times of real change and hope. The White House was lit up in rainbow colors when the Supreme Court struck down same-sex marriage bans. The world watched in awe as a Thai soccer team and their coach were rescued one-by-one by a group of brave diving experts after being trapped for more than three weeks. And there were moments so shocking we were left feeling helpless. Twenty-six people were killed in a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and eight parishioners and their pastor were gunned down during Bible study at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Revolutionary moments made history in real time as anger and passion turned into movements -- like the one made up of thousands of students who skipped classes worldwide to demand action from their leaders on the climate crisis. Here's a look back at some of the news stories that defined the past 10 years. Institutions were shaken by scandal The decade produced scandals that upended institutions from the Catholic Church to elite universities. The controversies began less than a year into 2010, when the US State Department was pushed into damage control mode after WikiLeaks released thousands of classified documents on July 25. WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, is now facing charges related to the leak. Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst who helped the site get access to the classified documents, is currently jailed for refusing to testify before the grand jury investigating Assange. A year later, another release -- this time, a grand jury report made public in November 2011 -- marked the beginning of a scandal that would ripple through Penn State University and lead to the termination of the school's beloved football coach. The report contained testimony that former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky sexually abused eight young boys, a number that would eventually increase to 10, over a period of at least 15 years. University officials purportedly failed to notify law enforcement after learning about some of these incidents. Sandusky was found guilty in 2012. Football coach Joe Paterno and university president Graham Spanier lost their jobs in the scandal. Sexual abuse within the Catholic Church was similarly far-reaching. In 2017 and 2018, the church in the US spent more than $300 million -- including $200 million in legal settlements -- on costs related to clergy sexual abuse. The payouts were only part of the fallout of the massive worldwide scandal in which the church was accused of repeatedly covering up sexual abuse. USA Gymnastics was likewise disgraced after Larry Nassar, a former USAG and Michigan State University doctor, was sentenced in 2018 to up to 175 years in prison after more than 150 women and girls testified he sexually abused them over two decades. Earlier this year, about 50 people were accused in a college admissions scandal of either cheating on standardized tests or bribing college coaches and school officials to accept students as college athletes -- even if they weren't. Among those named by federal prosecutors were actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman. Activism took center stage From #MeToo to Black Lives Matter, the 2010s were shaped by activism, beginning in 2011 with the Occupy Wall Street protest movement. The demonstrations against income inequality, corporate greed, and the influence of money in politics began in New York but spread to cities across the United States. Anger over the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin and the police shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in 2014 gave rise to the Black Lives Matter. What started as a social media hashtag quickly grew into an international movement protesting against police brutality and inequality. Another social media hashtag went offline when survivors of sexual abuse shared their stories with #MeToo. Although the hashtag was created years earlier by activist Tarana Burke, it caught fire after people in Hollywood used it to take down Harvey Weinstein. Not only did it spark a conversation about consent and harassment, but the global movement also contributed to powerful men like producers, actors, anchors and executives and politicians being called to account on harassment accusations. Communities were crushed by major disasters The decade also brought catastrophic natural and environmental disasters to points across the world. Haiti and Japan both were hit with the largest earthquakes ever to strike those countries. The 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti in 2010 and 9.1-magnitude quake -- followed by a tsunami -- the following year in Japan left hundreds of thousands of people dead and thousands more displaced. The first year of the decade also saw an explosion on board the Deepwater Horizon oil rig killed 11 people and released 168 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The strongest hurricane to strike the Bahamas made landfall in 2019. Hurricane Dorian slammed the island over Labor Day weekend and stalled there for more than 48 hours. It was one of five Category 5 hurricanes to form this decade. The others: Matthew, Irma, Maria, Michael and Lorenzo. Hurricane Maria, which made landfall on the island nation of Dominica as a Category 5 hurricane and hit Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm in 2017, caused about $90 billion in damage and resulted in nearly 3,000 deaths. The same year introduced a yearslong spate of wildfires in California, including the deadliest in the state's history. Gun violence and terrorist attacks continued... Mass shootings in the United States shook the country's sense of safety as targeted places included an elementary school, nightclubs, colleges, a music festival and places of worship. More than half of the 10 deadliest US mass shootings took place in this decade, including when a gunman opened fire inside Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June 2016. At least 49 people were killed. In October 2017, 58 people were gunned down at an outdoor music festival in Las Vegas. The shootings raised a debate across the nation about access to firearms. Violent attacks weren't limited to the United States. ISIS showed its global reach in 2015 with a terror attack in Paris and a series of attacks in Tunisia, including at a hotel where 38 people were killed. At Garissa University College in Kenya, four gunmen killed 147 people and wounded scores more during morning prayer in April 2015, making it the deadliest attack in Kenya since the 1998 United States embassy bombings. The Somalia-based Al-Shabaab militant group claimed responsibility for the terror attack. An act of terrorism also devastated the city of Boston in 2013. Two bombs exploded 12 seconds apart near the finish line of the Boston Marathon killing three people and injuring at least 264. ... and so did conflicts between and within countries But bloodshed this past decade didn't only come in isolated attacks. The decade was scarred by humanitarian crises and devastating conflicts -- like the yearslong civil war in Yemen, which has taken the lives of more than 100,000 people. In 2012, the American government came under fire after four Americans were killed in Benghazi, Libya. Critics said the State Department may not have done enough to protect its employees. Back home, Americans faced a rise in extremism. A 2017 government report found far-right-wing violent extremist groups were to blame for the majority of deadly extremist incidents in the country since 2001. The total number of fatalities from far-right wing violent extremists and radical Islamist violent extremists was about the same. The words ""white nationalism"" began leaking into headlines after the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who was killed as a car plowed through a crowd protesting a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. James Alex Fields Jr., the man accused of driving into the crowd has been sentenced to life in prison on hate crime charges. Across the ocean, Europe was fighting its own battle against racism. A CNN poll in 2018 recorded frightening anti-Semitic attitudes across the continent while many blamed a substantial amount of Brexit votes on a rise in racism. With millions fleeing from violence in the Middle East and Africa, Europeans began taking measures against the influx of immigrants. A heartbreaking image of 3-year-old Syrian boy Alan Kurdi shook the world and offered a glimpse into just how badly the European migrant crisis was handled. Four years later a similar photo surfaced: a father and daughter from El Salvador lay face down in murky waters. The devastating picture offered a glimpse into the dangers and challenges migrants face trying to cross from Mexico into the US. The crisis at the border was center stage during the 2016 elections, with then-candidate Donald Trump vowing to build a wall to curb illegal migration. Trump's administration would later draw worldwide condemnation for its practices of separating children from their parents at the border and holding migrants in overcrowded cage-like units.  Political divides widened The past decade's politics have been marked by polarization and division. In a bitterly fought referendum, the United Kingdom voted in June 2016 to leave the European Union. The deal, called Brexit, eventually led to the resignation of British Prime Minister Theresa May and the election of hardline Brexit supporter Boris Johnson. In another divisive decision, the United States elected businessman Donald Trump, a Republican, as president over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a Democrat in November 2016. Three years into his term -- and following dozens of controversial decisions and tweets -- Trump, this month, became the third US president to be impeached. The House of Representatives voted to charge him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Meanwhile, citizens of countries took on their leadership and protested for change. Thousands took to the streets in Venezuela in 2019 in failed effort to remove Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from office. In Hong Kong, protests began in June 2019 in response to a bill that would have allowed citizens of Hong Kong to be extradited to China. The protests have continued for months nonstop and resulted in violent clashes with police. The focus of the protests also has shifted to demand greater democracy and an inquiry into allegations of police brutality. We reached historic milestones But among division and disasters, the world took major strides toward change. In 2011, American troops pulled out of Iraq after nearly nine years in the country -- fighting a war over which many high-ranking officials were criticized for not putting an end to earlier. In a landmark opinion, the US Supreme Court ruled in June 2015 that same-sex couples can marry nationwide. The divided court's decision established a new civil right and gave a historic victory to gay rights advocates. Later that year, in December, about 195 nations agreed to begin tackling the climate crisis head-on by reducing greenhouse gas emissions -- the primary driver of climate change -- and entering into other agreements. The agreement became known as the 2015 Paris Climate accord. In 2019, the Trump administration announced that the US would pull out of the agreement following the President's claims that it would punish American workers and benefit foreign countries. And this year, the most diverse class of lawmakers to date took office in the US Congress, bringing greater gender, racial, religious and sexuality representation. "	CNN

Especially Vladimir Putin	"Moscow (CNN)In the global battle of ideas, Russian President Vladimir Putin has had a banner year. Back in June, Putin made waves by declaring the death of Western liberalism. Those remarks seemed timed to provoke debate ahead of the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan. But it wasn't just talk: In the months that followed, Putin would continue to set the example for authoritarian leadership. Take, for example, Putin's policies toward his country's embattled and marginalized political opposition. For much of the summer, the Russian capital of Moscow saw a wave of opposition demonstrations. For a time, unsanctioned rallies and solo protests seemed to gain momentum. Russian authorities even dropped criminal charges against a prominent investigative reporter after an unexpected public outpouring of support. But a crackdown on the opposition then followed, with the detention of leading opposition figures and sweeping arrests of more than 2,000 demonstrators. The Russian government, it seemed, was determined not to let street protests get anywhere near the scale seen in Hong Kong. Russia also showed willingness to exert more control over its citizens online. In May, Putin signed into law new measures directing the creation of a so-called ""sovereign internet"" capable of operating independently from the rest of the world. The law mandates that all Russian internet providers install special equipment to enable the use of ""deep packet inspection,"" a type of data processing that can be used to surveil and censor internet traffic. The new law took effect in November, establishing Russia as a leader in authoritarian tech. Critics say Putin's push for greater control of the internet effectively gave the Russian government a ""kill switch"" to shut off internet traffic. The Russian government didn't impose widespread internet blackouts in response to protests -- unlike the Iranian government, which pulled the plug on the internet to prevent people from organizing or communicating during recent nationwide anti-government demonstrations. But, during protests this summer in Moscow, authorities did appear to introduce selective outages in some locations to jam or interfere with cell phone usage. Little surprise, then, that Putin took Chinese President Xi Jinping's side in the China-US confrontation over the Trump administration's decision to effectively block all Huawei involvement in American 5G networks amid spying concerns. At the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin said that US actions risked ""technological war"" over emerging digital technologies. Putin and Xi had other reasons to bond. Beijing may be coming in for criticism over Xinjiang detention centers and its response to Hong Kong protests, but none of those criticisms are being raised by Moscow. On the international scene, Putin found common ground with some of the world's other authoritarian leaders. In September, Putin played host to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, in a show of support for his embattled Latin American counterpart. The following month, he paid a visit to Saudi Arabia, showcasing an oil-driven partnership with a longstanding ally of the US. There would be no uncomfortable questions from Putin about the kingdom's human rights record. Putin's visit to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates was described by many observers as a sort of victory lap. But the Kremlin leader's biggest foreign policy triumph of the year was over Syria. In October, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met in the southern Russian resort city of Sochi to hammer out a 10-point memorandum of understanding on Syria's future. That deal in many ways formalized facts on the ground. President Donald Trump had already abandoned Washington's Kurdish allies in Syria, by ordering a sudden withdrawal of US forces from Syria. The deal left two strongmen -- Putin and Erdogan -- as the main geopolitical players in Syria. Putin's gamble in backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, it seems, has paid off. While a small contingent of US troops remains in Syria, the Assad regime is securely in power, and Russia has a larger military footprint in the country, with Russian forces even falling in on abandoned US military infrastructure in Syria. That's not to say that Putin was always on a winning streak in 2019. Russia's military suffered an embarrassing setback in August after a deadly blast at a military test range killed at least five people and sent radiation levels briefly spiking. The Russian government never confirmed what specific weapon was being tested, but international speculation centered on a nuclear-powered cruise missile called Burevestnik or Skyfall, one of Putin's pet military projects. And Putin still has to deal with a simmering conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists are still fighting the Ukrainian government. Putin traveled to Paris to meet his counterparts from Germany, France and Ukraine to talk about steps toward ending the war, but those discussions ended without a major breakthrough. But in marked contrast to the Trump administration's Ukraine problem, Putin doesn't have to worry about impeachment. That's not to say he doesn't have an opinion: in his annual news conference in late December, he seemed to mirror Republican talking points by saying impeachment was based on ""made-up reasons"" and expressing doubt that Trump will be removed from office.

Popular online video game ""Grand Theft Auto V"" has become a battleground between protesters in the semi-autonomous Chinese city and their rival players in mainland China. The online duel began after Hong Kong players discovered that their in-game avatars could dress like protesters, wearing black clothing, gas masks and yellow safety helmets. They shared the discovery last week on LIHKG, a social media platform and discussion forum similar to Reddit that is popular in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has been rocked by anti-government protests for more than six months, with escalating violence and anger on all sides. The demonstrations began in June after the government introduced a bill that would have allowed the extradition of people across the border to face trial in mainland China. The bill has since been withdrawn, but the protests have expanded to include calls for greater democracy and an inquiry into accusations of police misconduct. GTA V is an action-adventure game that rewards gamers for committing virtual crimes. It allows dozens of players to interact simultaneously in ""open world"" environments, with bank heists and carjackings at the core of its gameplay. While most video games keep the player busy on a predetermined course of action, open-world games allow greater freedom to explore. And it didn't take long for Hong Kong gamers to begin mimicking the real-life actions of hardcore protesters by throwing petrol bombs, vandalizing train stations and attacking police within the open world of GTA V. Mainland Chinese gamers were quick to notice, and several of them subsequently took to the Twitter-like social media platform Weibo to call on other players to defeat their Hong Kong rivals. Using a derogatory term adopted by some police officers to refer to protesters, one Weibo user posted: ""Cockroaches expressed their desire to kill GTA and beat us, the war in this game may become more fierce and fierce. Are you ready?"" Other Weibo users responded by posting screenshots of their characters dressed as riot police and wielding guns, with the posts captioned: ""Ready!"" Several intense battles played out simultaneously, according to Hong Kong gamer Mickey Chang, who is in his 20s and plays games that are live-streamed on the YouTube channel Minilife HK. Protester avatars threw petrol bombs at riot police controlled by mainland gamers, who responded with water cannons and tear gas. In the end, the mainlanders emerged victorious as they overwhelmed the Hong Kong protesters through sheer numbers, Chang told CNN Business. Chang said that he liked to play as a protester because it helped to ""raise awareness"" overseas about the situation in Hong Kong. ""(GTA) is a fun way of engaging people with different viewpoints to discuss, since you can have up to 30 strangers on a server that may not know much about Hong Kong,"" he said. Launched in 1997, the ""Grand Theft Auto"" series by Rockstar Games is one of the most successful in video game history. GTA V alone has sold over 125 million copies since its 2013 launch. But the series has long been criticized for its violent gameplay — the 2001 release, GTA III, achieved notoriety after it was discovered that players could hire a prostitute, have (offscreen) sex with her, kill her, and then steal her money. CNN Business has reached out to Rockstar Games for comment about its use by Hong Kong protest supporters and their opposition. This is not the first time that Hong Kong protesters have taken to video games to publicize their struggle. In October, Google removed a role playing game called ""The Revolution Of Our Times"" — a protest slogan — from the Play Store, citing a violation of its policies. "	CNN
10	https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/15/asia/hong-kong-protests-explainer-intl-hnk-scli/index.html	Updated 4:08 AM ET, Fri December 20, 2019	From an extradition bill to a political crisis: A guide to the Hong Kong protests	"(CNN)Hong Kong has been rocked by pro-democracy, anti-government protests for more than six months now, with escalating violence and anger on all sides. What began as peaceful mass marches has exploded into the city's biggest political crisis in modern times. It's also become a geopolitical mess with worldwide implications. Companies, brands, politicians and celebrities -- even LeBron James -- have been caught in the crossfire. Nobody is quite sure where the protests are headed, but there's no clear end in sight. Here's everything you need to know about the Hong Kong protests. Why are people protesting? The protests began in June with one main objective -- for the government to withdraw a controversial bill that would have allowed extradition of fugitives to mainland China. Critics worried Beijing could use the bill to prosecute people for political reasons under China's opaque legal system. Unlike other cities in China, which are tightly governed by the authoritarian central government, Hong Kong is a semi-autonomous city with its own legal and political systems. Protesters feared the bill would allow China to encroach on these rare freedoms. As the stand-off with the government stretched on, peaceful mass marches increasingly descended into violent clashes with police -- and the movement quickly grew to include five major demands: Fully withdraw the extradition bill
Set up an independent inquiry to probe police brutality
Withdraw a characterization of early protests as ""riots""
Release those arrested at protests
Implement universal suffrage in Hong Kong The broader demands reflect a long-standing call for full democracy, which Hong Kong does not have -- its leader is chosen by a tiny election committee dominated by pro-establishment, pro-Beijing voters. By the time Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam agreed to the first demand, withdrawing the bill, it was too late to quell the movement's momentum. How did this spin out of control? This began with peaceful marches. Now, two protesters have been shot with live rounds, a man was set on fire, and another man died after being hit with a brick during clashes. Long-standing allegations of police neglect, as well as several violent incidents have added fuel to the fire and pushed the city further into chaos. On July 21, a mob violently attacked protesters in a subway station, injuring at least 45 people. Protesters accuse the police of inaction during the attack, and many saw this as a sign that the police force couldn't be trusted to protect the people. Protesters have also become more extreme in their vandalism, setting fires in subway stations and smashing shop windows -- drawing criticism of senseless destruction from those who oppose the movement, and even some supporters. Rampant misinformation and conspiracy theories online have also added to the polarization and widespread sense of fear. Violent confrontations have taken place during some protests, and people accused of being ""infiltrators"" have been savagely beaten. What has the government said? Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam did publicly apologize early on in the summer, saying the unrest was ""caused by the deficiencies of the (Hong Kong) government."" But since then, she and other official bodies have taken a harder line. Nearly every week, the police condemn ""rioters,"" and call for law and order. Lam warned that the protests were bringing Hong Kong ""to the brink of no return,"" and that the government would not concede to protesters' demands. ""If there is any wishful thinking that by escalating violence the (Hong Kong) government will yield to pressure to satisfy protesters' so-called demands, I'm making this clear that will not happen,"" she said. What is China's role in all this? Hong Kong's relationship with mainland China is a key element in untangling this mess. Hong Kong was a British territory until it was handed over to Chinese control in 1997 -- but the handover agreement gave the city protected special freedoms of press, speech, and assembly for at least 50 years. These freedoms stand in stark contrast to China's strict censorship and Chinese President Xi Jinping's tight grip on power, which have seen dissidents jailed and interrogated in secret prisons. This is what we mean when we say Hong Kong is semi-autonomous. The city is part of China -- but it has its own currency, language, legal system, identity and culture. This model of governance is called ""one country, two systems."" And this is why protesters here are desperate to protect their freedoms -- because they fear becoming just another Chinese city under Xi's rule. Now, young protesters say China's encroachment on Hong Kong's autonomy is a violation of the ""two systems"" agreement. Many want to achieve full democracy before 2047, the pre-handover agreed date when Hong Kong could in theory become fully integrated with China. Some are even calling for full independence from the mainland. This strong anti-China sentiment is why protesters have targeted Chinese-owned businesses -- for instance, they smashed the ATMs at Bank of China locations. They have also boycotted restaurants that expressed pro-China stances. What has China said? Beijing has taken a firm rhetorical stance, saying the protests ""showed signs of terrorism."" Xi has demanded an end to the violence, saying the ""radical"" protests had trampled the city's rule of law and that ""stopping the violence and restoring order"" was Hong Kong's most ""urgent task."" He has also praised the city's police force and Lam's leadership ""in severely punishing the violent criminals in accordance with the law."" These comments appear to dispel rumors that Beijing was looking to replace Lam, instead sending a clear message -- Lam is here to stay. The central Chinese government hasn't done much in terms of actual action, largely letting Hong Kong leaders deal with the crisis -- but the threat of Chinese military intervention has hung over the movement for months. The Chinese military has a presence in Hong Kong -- about 6,000 People's Liberation Army soldiers are housed in barracks in the city. In August, the garrison commander warned that violence by protesters ""should not be tolerated,"" raising concerns that Beijing could use the troops to crack down on protests. However, it is not clear if Beijing has a red line, and what it would take for protesters to cross it before provoking a Chinese military response. Didn't Hong Kong protest in 2014, too? Yes, but not like this. During the 2014 Umbrella Revolution, protesters occupied the city's financial center, demanding democratic electoral reform and protesting against increasing Chinese influence -- but the scale and severity are different this time around. The Umbrella Revolution lasted 79 days, or a little over two and a half months. The ongoing protests have now passed the six month mark. The Umbrella Revolution saw police deploy pepper spray. Now, people are facing lethal force -- a protester shot by police and the man set on fire are both in critical condition at the hospital. The roots of the current unrest can be traced back to that summer five years ago, both in the radicalizing effect it had on a whole generation of young Hong Kongers and in the government's failure to take action. The protest movement finally collapsed in December 2014, but the underlying frustrations continued simmering -- until they finally exploded this June. How have the protests impacted Hong Kong? Five months of violence and vandalism have caused the city's economy to tank, and Hong Kong officially entered a recession in October. Retail and tourism numbers are plunging, small businesses have been forced to close, and people are losing their jobs -- especially in the tourism and food sectors, where the unemployment rate has risen by 5%. The government has implemented measures to support the impacted businesses, including slashing rents at properties they lease out. The economic downturn could eventually recover -- but the social divide and protesters' mistrust in the government could take much longer to heal, if possible at all. How does this affect the rest of the world? Hong Kong is a global financial hub -- so a hit to its economy affects business worldwide as well. Experts warned early on that if the unrest continues, international companies could look to pull out of Hong Kong and relocate their branches elsewhere. There has been no substantive indication that Beijing is planning to deploy troops, but as fear of PLA intervention has spread throughout the city, experts have warned that such a crackdown could be disastrous for Hong Kong. The stock market would likely crash, followed by the housing market. A mass exodus could follow, and other countries could see migrants incoming from Hong Kong. Many Hong Kongers hold foreign passports, a legacy of 1997, and it is easy for them to move overseas. On a more abstract level, some people have framed the unrest as a tug-of-war between Chinese authoritarianism and the Western ideals of freedom and democracy. This narrative oversimplifies some of the nuances at play -- but it's also perhaps why the movement has gained traction in the US, where Trump signed an act in support of the protests after it was passed almost unanimously by both houses of Congress. Why are people talking about the NBA? South Park? Versace? Many brands and companies have gotten caught in the middle. Those who sympathize with the protesters face Chinese fury and financial backlash; those who try to placate China draw accusations of cowardice from protest supporters, both in Hong Kong and internationally. For example, an NBA team general manager tweeted in support of the protests. The NBA apologized, drawing intense domestic criticism for appearing to bow to Chinese pressure -- then it reaffirmed its support for freedom of expression, incensing China and losing valuable Chinese partnerships. Basketball stars like LeBron James and Shaquille O'Neal have also spoken out about the issue. Meanwhile, television show ""South Park"" satirized Hollywood's sensitivity to Chinese government censors -- then, the show creators explicitly called out the NBA in a mock ""apology"" afterward. Brands like Vans, Nike, Versace, Coach, and Givenchy have also come under fire for offending either China or the protesters. What's next? The reality is, it's unclear. The protests look to be growing smaller -- at least, compared to the marches in June that drew hundreds of thousands of people -- but the lack of a major mass march is also partly due to government restrictions on transport and police refusing approval for such an event. The local district council elections in November showed just how widespread support for the movement still is. Pro-democracy candidates won a landslide victory, taking nearly 90% of the seats up for grabs. It was the highest election turnout in Hong Kong's history, and delivered a stinging rebuke to the government. District councillors don't hold much actual power, mainly focusing on local issues -- but pro-democrats now have more of a say in selecting the next Chief Executive in 2022. Meanwhile, police have arrested over 6,100 people and formally charged nearly 1,000 since June 9, when the protests began. The youngest arrested so far is 11 years old. With both the protesters and the government unwilling to give ground, it's uncertain how or when the conflict can end. For now, residents are bracing for further economic loss, and some have already decided to leave. "	CNN

The screen went black just before 9 p.m. ET after PBS moderator Judy Woodruff asked Mayor Pete Buttigieg if the US should boycott the 2022 Beijing Olympics over China's alleged mass detention of its Uyghur citizens. The feed from the PBS/Politico debate in Los Angeles remained cut for about nine minutes while candidates were asked about a range of China issues, including the Hong Kong protests and military tensions in the South China Sea. Censors regularly screen live broadcasts on international media networks in China, ready to cut any segment from the air if it is deemed politically sensitive by the ruling Communist Party. Viewers know that what they are seeing has been censored because the screen goes black and all sound cuts out. CNN stories on the Xinjiang detention centers and the protests in Hong Kong are regularly removed from the air by Chinese censors. The US State Department claims that up to 2 million Muslim-majority Uyghurs may have been detained in mass detention centers in China's Xinjiang province. Former detainees and activists claim they have been subjected to hash conditions and abuse as they undergo political re-education inside the camps. Leaked documents from the Chinese government appear to show a program designed to turn members of the Muslim minority into patriotic, Chinese-speaking citizens. Beijing has strongly denied allegations of human rights abuses at the camps, which it says are ""vocational training centers"" with a focus on deradicalization and counterterrorism. Multiple government officials have already claimed that all the ""trainees"" at the camps have graduated and returned to society, without providing any evidence. "	CNN
12	https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/17/investing/asian-market-latest-cathay-pacific/index.html	Updated 10:22 PM ET, Tue December 17, 2019	Cathay Pacific will cut capacity next year as Hong Kong protests continue	"Hong Kong (CNN Business)Shares of Cathay Pacific opened down 1.6% in Hong Kong on Wednesday after the city's flagship airline recorded yet another dismal month and said it would reduce capacity next year. But the stock reversed direction in mid-morning trade and was last up 0.2%. The company is still trying to overcome months of protests in the Asian financial hub, which have deterred tourists and weighed heavily on the airline industry and other sectors. Cathay (CPCAY) said Tuesday afternoon that its inbound traffic to Hong Kong plunged 46% in November compared to a year ago. The airline and its Cathay Dragon subsidiary, which handles regional flights, also carried 9% less passengers last month than they did a year prior. That was the fourth straight month that passenger demand dropped. ""November continued to be very challenging for both Cathay Pacific and Hong Kong, with sentiment for travel still weak,"" wrote Ronald Lam, chief customer and commercial officer for Cathay Pacific, in a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The company also decided to cut seat capacity next year by 1.4%, reversing an original plan to increase capacity by 3.1%. Lam said that's the ""first time in a long while"" that Cathay will reduce its size. It's been a bad year for Cathay. In August, its former CEO and chief commercial officer resigned after several tumultuous weeks, during which the airline was heavily criticized by Chinese state media. Although Cathay's stock price is down nearly 20% from the high it touched in April, shares have rebounded somewhat this quarter. Hong Kong's airline and travel industries have been feeling the pain in recent months as the pro-democracy protests continue with no end in sight. The political crisis has compounded problems the city already faces, including a weak economic outlook and the US-China trade war. Hong Kong Airlines, a smaller carrier, nearly lost its flying license earlier this month because of financial difficulties. And on Sunday Hong Kong International Airport reported that the number of passengers who passed through the airport plunged by 16.2% in November compared to a year earlier. That's a drop of nearly one million people. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index (HSI), of which Cathay is not a component, reversed opening gains and dipped 0.1%. Elsewhere in Asia, markets were mixed Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei (N225) and South Korea's Kospi (KOSPI) fell 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively. China's Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP) was virtually unchanged.

13	https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/17/media/tvb-layoff-hong-kong-protests/index.html	Updated 3:55 AM ET, Tue December 17, 2019	Hong Kong protests and economic woes are pushing the city's major broadcaster to cut staff	"Hong Kong (CNN Business)The biggest television broadcaster in Hong Kong is cutting staff as the city plunges into recession and its political crisis continues with ""no sign of abating,"" the company's CEO told workers this week. Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) — which has 3,500 employees, not counting actors and TV hosts — will make the cuts, which will affect 10% of the workforce, to help with costs, CEO Mark Lee Po On wrote in a letter to the staff this week. TVB provided a copy of the letter to CNN Business. He pointed out that protests in the city have lasted for more than half a year, taking a heavy toll on tourism, retail and other markets. ""Recession is a foregone conclusion,"" Lee added. ""No business sector including advertising, television, newspaper and other media will be spared."" The economy slowed more dramatically than expected in the third quarter, pushing Hong Kong into its first recession since 2009. And the Hong Kong government warned last month that the protests will cause the Asian financial hub's economy to shrink by 1.3% this year, marking the first year of recession since the global financial crisis a decade ago. The pro-democracy protests, a synchronized global economy slowdown, and trade tensions between the United States and China are all contributing to the problems. In his letter, Lee said that Hong Kong's ""uncertain outlook"" was ""worrying."" ""It is impossible to predict when social order will be restored and the economy will recover,"" he said, adding that companies must now work to sustain their businesses. Lee said that the affected staff will be informed as soon as possible and will receive some form of severance pay or other compensation. Unaffected staff will receive discretionary bonuses. The broadcaster still has plans to speed up business development in mainland China, Lee said, which he added will provide ""new development opportunities."" The company also plans to roll out new products in Southeast Asia and North America. TVB has also found itself a source of controversy during the protests. The broadcaster has been criticized by protesters for what they see as pro-government bias, the New York Times reported in July. The company said that month that it has ""always maintained neutrality, professionalism and objectivity in its news coverage."" In his letter, Lee said that because many people have stayed home for the past six months, TVB has experienced an ""upswing"" in ratings. TVB is traded publicly in Hong Kong. It closed up 0.7% on Tuesday. The local economy has been hit hard by the protests, which are driving away visitors. On Sunday, for example, Hong Kong International Airport reported that the number of passengers who passed through the airport plunged by 16.2% in November compared to a year earlier. That's nearly one million people. Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan also said Sunday that he is worried international investors will lose patience with Hong Kong and turn to other cities in the region or places in mainland China to do business.

Here's a timeline of key events in the talks since then: December 1, 2018: Trump and Xi, joined by top aides, agree to a temporary truce on tariffs and what the White House says is a 90-day round of negotiations toward a comprehensive deal. December 4, 2018: With Beijing declining to confirm the 90-day clock, Trump tweets that, while he remains optimistic about talks, he is still prepared to raise tariffs if no deal is reached: ""I am a Tariff Man."" Markets tank. December 5, 2018: Chinese officials and Trump move to reassure investors by sending positive signals about the talks. January 7, 2019: US negotiators head to Beijing for a first round of face-to-face talks despite the partial shutdown of the federal government back in Washington. January 30-31, 2019: China's top negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, visits Washington for further talks. Trump sends mixed messages, saying talks are progressing ""well"" but that a final deal would only be made directly between Xi and him. February 15, 2019: Another round of talks in Beijing closes with Xi meeting briefly with US negotiators, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who calls the meetings ""productive"" in a tweet. Later, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders says in a statement ""much work remains."" February 22, 2019: With the 90-day deadline approaching, Trump meets with Liu and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in the Oval Office -- and engages in an extraordinary public confrontation with Lighthizer over calling the proposed deal a ""memorandum of understanding."" February 24, 2019: Trump tweets that he will not move ahead with tariffs on March 1 as talks continue. He offers to host a signing summit at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where he had hosted Xi in 2017. March 20, 2019: Trump signals that he intends to leave existing tariffs in place even if a deal is signed, in order to retain leverage over Beijing. April 1, 2019: Amid renewed negotiations, Beijing announces a move to control the manufacturing and distribution of fentanyl-related substances -- a key Trump priority. May 5, 2019: Ahead of a planned visit by Chinese negotiators to Washington, Trump reactivates his threat to escalate tariffs as originally promised before trade talks kicked off in December. May 6, 2019: Lighthizer and Mnuchin confirm plans the US will move forward with the President's threat to escalate tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods set to go effect on May 10, after claiming Beijing officials had reneged on prior commitments. May 8, 2019: China threatens to retaliate, but moves ahead with sending a delegation to Washington. May 9-10: Lighthizer, Mnuchin and Liu hold talks and a working dinner. May 10, 2019: US raises tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200 billion in Chinese goods after the talks end without an agreement. US officials formally open the door to adding new tariffs to another $300 billion in goods -- ""essentially all remaining imports from China,"" including consumer items like toys and electronics left out of the initial tariff round. May 13, 2019: Beijing strikes back, hiking tariffs to 25% on $60 billion in US exports, including cotton, machinery, grains and aircraft parts. June 18, 2019: Trump announces that negotiations are resuming, and says he spoke with Xi and agreed to hold talks at the G20 meeting in Osaka, Japan. Months later, CNN reports that Trump told Xi he would stay quiet on Hong Kong protests, and also discussed his 2020 Democratic rivals Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. June 28, 2019: Trump meets with Xi. At a news conference the next day, Trump says he promised not to raise tariffs further, and said negotiators would pick up ""where we left off"" before the tariff escalation in May. July 30, 2019: Mnuchin and Lighthizer wrap up discussions in Shanghai and agree to continue talks in early September. August 1, 2019: Trump announces in a tweet that he will impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion in remaining Chinese imports starting September 1. August 5, 2019: China retaliates by halting purchases of US agricultural goods, citing ""serious violation of the consensus reached by the two countries' leaders in Osaka."" The same day, the US Treasury Department formally labels China a currency manipulator, after Trump tweets that Beijing has used depreciation to ""steal our business and factories."" August 13, 2019: After Lighthizer, Mnuchin and Liu agree in a call to restart negotiations in September, Trump agrees to delay imposing new tariffs on some consumer goods until December 15 -- a move that also relieves concerns about depressing consumer spending heading into the holiday season. August 23, 2019: Beijing unveils a new round of tariffs of up to 10% on $75 billion in US goods -- including whiskey -- and announces plans to reimpose tariffs on US autos and parts starting December 15. Trump responds with a threat to raise tariffs to 30% from 25% on Chinese goods already being taxed, and to bump up his planned tariff on consumer goods from 10% to 15%. August 26, 2019: Trump indicates a resumption of talks, claiming in a news conference at the G7 summit in France that Mnuchin had ""many calls"" concerning China. China's Foreign Ministry declines to confirm any such calls, and Mnuchin describes ""communications"" rather than calls. September 1, 2019: Fresh tariffs go into effect from both sides, hitting Chinese-made consumer goods coming into the US and some US products entering China. September 5, 2019: The US and China agree to resume talks in early October after a phone call among Liu, Lighthizer and Mnuchin. September 11, 2019: Beijing exempts some US goods -- including shrimp and cancer drugs -- from tariffs, and Trump pushes back his threatened tariff hike on Chinese goods already being taxed from October 1 to October 15. September 13, 2019: Beijing adds US soybeans and pork to its exempted list. September 19-20, 2019: Chinese negotiators visit Washington, and agree to plans for high-level meetings to resume in October -- but cancel a planned visit to farmers in Montana and Nebraska. Mnuchin later appears to surprise Trump when he says the cancellation came at the request of US officials. October 11, 2019: In an Oval Office appearance alongside Liu, Trump announces a ""very substantial phase one deal"" -- then says it will take three to five weeks to get it finalized on paper and suggests he will meet Xi at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit scheduled for mid-November in Chile. He says he will cancel a planned tariff increase to 30% for some goods. October 30, 2019: Chile cancels APEC summit amid violent protests. There's no backup site. November 8, 2019: Trump throws cold water on comments from China's Foreign Ministry about tariff rollbacks, telling reporters: ""I haven't agreed to anything."" November 22, 2019: Xi says in Beijing that he hopes to work out an agreement based on ""mutual respect and equality."" Trump says in a ""Fox & Friends"" interview that the US and China have a deal ""potentially very close."" December 3, 2019: Speaking on the sidelines of a NATO summit, Trump suggests a deal might not be struck until after the 2020 election: ""In some ways, I think it's better to wait 'til after the election, you want to know the truth."" December 12, 2019: US and Chinese negotiators reach tentative phase one trade deal. This story has been updated with events."	CNN

The city's anti-government, pro-democracy protests have grown increasingly violent since they began in June, and have sparked calls for an independent investigation into alleged police brutality. In response, the government appointed a panel of overseas experts to assist the city's longstanding Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC). However, last month a member of the panel voiced criticisms of the IPCC, suggesting the council lacks sufficient independent investigative powers. The experts reiterated the point in a statement Wednesday, saying they had identified ""a crucial shortfall"" in the IPCC's capabilities. The panel said the issue needed to be addressed for the IPCC to meet the standards of a police watchdog -- but that ""dialogue with the IPCC has not led to any agreed process through which the IEP (International Experts Panel) would be able to effectively support the Thematic Study (of several key protest events) any further at this stage"". ""As a result, the IEP has taken the decision to formally stand aside from its role,"" they said. The statement added that the panel would continue to support the IPCC's work ""if and when it develops the necessary capabilities."" In a statement later Wednesday, the IPCC thanked the experts for their contribution, but did not respond directly to the criticisms. IPCC chairman Anthony Neoh also cautioned in the statement that ""we do not have investigation power under current setting,"" and that any changes to the council's powers or functions would require ""consensus from the community and stakeholders."" IPCC Vice Chair Tony Tse clarified in a press conference that the experts had not resigned, but were standing aside because ""the first round of the jobs have come to an end."" ""We hope that we will continue to keep in touch, at this moment, their tasks were completed and this will be reflected on the interim report,"" Tse said. The experts' departure comes as the Hong Kong protests approach the six-month mark. The protests had begun in opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill, but the relationship between the police force and protesters quickly deteriorated as clashes grew violent and frequent. Protesters accuse the police of using excessive force and tear gas; police have repeatedly claimed they is using the minimal necessary force. The protesters now have four major remaining demands -- including an independent inquiry into police conduct. Many have accused the IPCC of not being sufficiently equipped for such an investigation -- and the experts' statement on Wednesday appeared to confirm their fears. ""The entire IEP (International Expert Panel) decided to jump ship,"" said Tanya Chan, a legislator from the Democratic Party, on Wednesday. ""This is a very crucial act and it's a vote of non-confidence to this report."" However, the government has repeatedly pushed back against these claims. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said last month that the IPCC needs time and space to finish the study, adding, ""I have confidence the IPCC will spare no effort."" The IPCC is set to finish their report by January, when it will then be sent to Lam to review. "	CNN
16	https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/asia/nato-china-russia-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 7:18 AM ET, Wed December 4, 2019	A challenge from China could be just the thing to pull NATO together	"Hong Kong (CNN)The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is looking more disorganized than ever, but a major Pacific rival could help push them back together. Speaking this week during a two-day meeting in London to mark the organization's 70th anniversary, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance needed to start taking ""into account that China is coming closer to us."" ""We see them in the Arctic, we see them in Africa, we see we see them investing heavily in European infrastructure and of course investing in cyberspace,"" Stoltenberg said of China, adding that this was not ""about moving NATO into the South China Sea."" His comments come as a dispute between French President Emmanuel Macron and US President Donald Trump has exposed major rifts in the Cold War-era military alliance. 'Brain death' Speaking last month, Macron warned that NATO was at risk of ""brain death,"" due to ongoing US indifference for the alliance -- which Trump has previously described as ""obsolete"" -- and in particular criticized Washington's decision to pull out of Syria, leaving Kurdish allies at the mercy of Turkey, which soon invaded. ""You have partners together in the same part of the world, and you have no coordination whatsoever of strategic decision-making between the United States and its NATO allies,"" Macron said. On his arrival in London this week for the summit, Trump described the French leader's comments as ""nasty"" and ""insulting,"" as other leaders offered milder rebukes of Macron, who has held his ground. The row has exposed tensions at the top of the alliance, which is dominated by the fiercely pro-European Union powers of France and Germany, and the openly EU-skeptical Trump. It's also raised questions over what, exactly, NATO is for in 2019, and how much influence members should have over each other's military policy. NATO was set up to fight the Cold War and push back against Soviet power in Europe, but the USSR is long gone, and whatever threat is posed by Russia today cannot compare. Traditionally the alliance has been led by US priorities, a reflection of Washington's outsized military role in any operations. The only time any member state has invoked Article 5 of the organization's treaty, which regards an attack on one as an attack on all members, was following the September 11 terrorist attacks. NATO took on a major anti-terror role following those attacks, and speaking last month Macron appeared to harken back to this as the chief priority of the organization today. ""Sometimes I hear some saying that it is Russia or China, our enemy,"" he said. ""Is it the purpose of the Atlantic Alliance to identify one or the other as our enemies? I don't think so. Our joint enemy, clearly within the Alliance, is terrorism that's struck our countries."" Destabilizing northern Syria by abandoning the Kurds to Turkey -- enabling hundreds of ISIS members to escape custody in the process -- is obviously acting against this priority, in Macron's view. Pacific rival But while Macron is skeptical about identifying China as an explicit enemy, both he and Trump have called for more action to be taken to balance Beijing's growing power. In his comments last month, Macron suggested Washington was pulling away from Europe just as the continent was facing more pressure from China, while Trump has taken a hard line on China with regard to trade. If NATO is not obsolete -- by no means a settled debate -- then China is perhaps exactly the type of counterweight it needs to prove its ongoing value to member states. China's military is going from strength to strength under President Xi Jinping, and Beijing is flexing its economic muscle throughout the Pacific and central Asia via Xi's Belt and Road trade and infrastructure megaproject. What policy to take on China has bedeviled EU leaders, with some member states, particularly NATO member Italy, happily embracing Beijing's largesse. NATO is made up of 29 member states, and numerous partner countries, including several -- Japan, South Korea, Australia -- who have long sought to balance China's growing regional power. But Beijing has not previously figured in NATO plans, even as it has evolved from being a ""purely defensive organization"" since the end of the Cold War. For his part, Stoltenberg has tried to emphasize that reorienting toward China is not about challenging Beijing in the Pacific (though multiple NATO states and partner countries do just that) but about resisting Chinese influence and aggression in Europe. Speaking in November, Stoltenberg said that ""we need to better understand the rise of China. And what it means for our security. In terms of opportunities and challenges."" ""China will soon have the world's biggest economy. And it already has the second largest defense budget, investing heavily in new capabilities,"" he said. ""Only in the last five years, China has added 80 ships and submarines to its navy -- the equivalent of the whole UK Royal Navy. It has hundreds of missiles with a range that would have been prohibited by the INF treaty. And it recently displayed an advanced intercontinental nuclear missile able to reach the United States and Europe. As well as a new supersonic cruise missile, an assortment of new drones, anti-ship missiles and hypersonic glider,"" added Stoltenberg. He made clear that challenges go beyond military: ""China is becoming a leader in the development of new technology. From 5G to facial recognition. And from quantum computing to gathering vast amounts of global data."" This year, Washington has urged allies to block Chinese technology giant Huawei from their 5G networks, citing security concerns that the company has consistently denied. NATO leaders are expected to sign a joint statement recognizing the ""opportunities and challenges"" presented by China. While this language is weaker than some states would want, this could be the increasingly rare area where there is more agreement than discord within NATO. Earlier this year, Germany's minister for foreign affairs said that ""China is a challenge on almost every topic, and it's important to gain a better understanding what's implies that for NATO."" The UK and Canada, both key NATO members, have also taken an increasingly harder line on China. London has clashed with Beijing over the ongoing Hong Kong protests and the detention of a British consular employee, while two Canadians are still being held in China in the wake of Ottawa's arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou. On Monday, Russia switched on an enormous gas pipeline to China worth billions of dollars, affirming increasingly close economic and political ties between NATO's traditional rival and its 21st century one. This growing closeness has largely been driven by Beijing, much to the alarm of some observers, but China could also be the thing that pulls an increasingly fraying NATO back together. "	CNN

""In response to the unreasonable behaviors of the US side, the Chinese government decides to suspend the review of requests by US military ships and aircraft to visit Hong Kong as of today,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a news conference in Beijing. Hua also announced that Beijing would impose sanctions on several US non-governmental human rights organizations that have been monitoring and reporting on the protests in Hong Kong. US President Donald Trump last week signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act into law after it sailed through both Houses of the US Congress with almost unanimous bipartisan approval. The new law would permit Washington to impose sanctions or even suspend Hong Kong's special trading status over rights violations. Shortly after the bill was signed into law, China's Foreign Ministry accused the US of ""bullying behavior,"" ""disregarding the facts"" and ""publicly supporting violent criminals."" On Monday it took more concrete action, banning consideration of visits by US warships to one of their longtime ports of call in Asia and a favorite spot for those aboard to get rest and relaxation after long periods at sea. Just over a year ago, the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan and ships in its strike group carried some 7,000 personnel into Hong Kong in what at the time was seen as an easing of tensions between Washington and Beijing over China's military buildup in the South China Sea. That visit came after China had denied a similar port call earlier in 2018. Since the Reagan visit, the amphibious command ship USS Blue Ridge, the flagship of the US Seventh Fleet, and the US Coast Guard Cutter Bertholf have made notable stops in Hong Kong, both in April. But in August, while protests were heating up in the city, China rejected scheduled visits by the amphibious transport dock USS Green Bay and the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Erie. South China Sea tensions Monday's Chinese Foreign Ministry announcement followed harsh words from Beijing last week after the US Navy sailed warships within 12 miles of Chinese-claimed islands in the South China Sea on Wednesday and Thursday in so-called ""freedom on navigation"" operations. Those actions ""upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea,"" Cmdr. Reann Mommsen, a spokeswoman for the Navy's 7th Fleet, told CNN in a statement. But China called them ""a highly dangerous provocation,"" according to Ren Guoqiang, spokesman for Beijing's Defense Ministry. ""The trespassing hurts regional peace and stability, harms China's sovereignty and security, and endangers the lives of frontline officers and soldiers of both sides,"" Ren said, according to a story posted on the military's English-language website. Human rights groups face sanctions In addition to the rebuke to the US military on Monday, China said it was sanctioning several US NGOs for so-called bad behavior during the Hong Kong protests. ""China decides to sanction on the organizations that behave badly during the Hong Kong extradition-bill unrest, including National Endowment for Democracy, National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, International Republican Institute, Human Rights Watch and Freedom House,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua said. The Chinese government accused the NGOs of supporting ""anti-China people"" and said they were instigating protesters ""engaging in extreme crimes"" in pursuit of Hong Kong's separation from China. It is unclear what sanctions will be imposed on the NGOs or how the organizations might be affected."	CNN

Hong Kong fell after the government reported further evidence that the local economy is suffering from long-running protests. Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) fell as much as 1.4% in early trading, but recovered some of that later in the morning. It was last down 0.5%. Hong Kong's retail sales plunged more than 24% in October from a year earlier — the biggest monthly decline on record — according to government statistics released Monday. The government attributed the decline to the protests and ""increasing violence,"" which it said has depressed consumer sentiment and disrupted tourism activities. Last month, the government warned the city is expected to sink into its first annual recession in a decade. Hong Kong is also set to post its first budget deficit in 15 years, Paul Chan, the city's financial secretary, told lawmakers on Monday at a legislative council meeting. Japan's Nikkei 225 (N225) fell 0.9%, retreating from its highest close this year on Monday. South Korea's Kospi (KOSPI)also dropped 0.6%. China's Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP) erased 0.4%. The broad losses in Asia also tracked overnight weakness on Wall Street. US stocks suffered sharp losses on Monday, as data showed the US manufacturing sector unexpectedly worsened in November. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also reminded Wall Street that the trade war may yet get worse before it gets better. Ross told Fox Business on Monday that the Trump administration could increase tariffs on China if no agreement is reached by December 15. Trump's signing of a bill last week supporting Hong Kong protests also threatens to heighten tensions between Beijing and Washington. China has vowed to take countermeasures and said it would ban US military visits to Hong Kong, among other moves. -- Matt Egan contributed to this report. "	CNN

Businessman Lee Henley Hu Xiang, who is a Belize citizen, and Taiwan national Lee Meng-chu were arrested for ""engaging in activities endangering China's national security and for their involvement in the Hong Kong riots,"" the Southern Daily reported. Lee Henley Hu Xiang was arrested on November 26 by the Guangzhou State Security bureau ""for funding criminal activities that endanger national security,"" the paper reported. Lee, who lives in China, is also accused of funding ""hostile forces"" in the US, sponsoring foreign organizations and individuals ""to damage China's national security,"" disrupting Hong Kong and supporting anti-China activities, and cooperating ""with external forces to intervene in Hong Kong affairs."" Taiwan national Lee Meng-chu was arrested on October 31 by Shenzhen State Security bureau for spying for foreign forces and illegally providing state secrets, according to the report. He went missing in late August at the border city of Shenzhen, which neighbors Hong Kong. He is also accused of being a key member of ""Taiwan independence"" forces; going to Hong Kong to support ""anti-China"" activities; and seeking military secrets in mainland China in August, the Southern Daily writes. Hong Kong has been hit by several months of protests that began over a now-withdrawn extradition bill. Since then, demonstrations have expanded to include five major demands, including an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality and wider democratic reforms. China was enraged on Thursday after US President Donald Trump signed an act in support of the protest movement. It came days after pro-democracy candidates scored a landslide victory in district council elections, framed as a de-facto referendum on the protest movement. "	CNN

The opinions expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinions on CNN. (CNN)President Donald Trump's tantrum diplomacy can often be summed up as unpredictable, counterintuitive and self-serving. But his decision to sign two bills supporting the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong shows that the President can occasionally do the right thing, even if it isn't necessarily for the right reasons. Just last week, Trump cast doubt on his support for the Hong Kong protests when he called in to ""Fox & Friends"" and said, ""We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I'm also standing with President Xi. He's a friend of mine... I'd like to see them work it out, OK?"" But Trump defied the expectations of many on Wednesday and signed the Human Rights and Democracy Act, as well as the Protect Hong Kong Act -- both of which passed Congress with broad, bipartisan support. The first bill authorizes sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials responsible for human rights abuses, while the second bans the export to Hong Kong police of US-made crowd control munitions such as tear gas, stun guns and rubber bullets. This is significant given that Hong Kong police have used teargas produced by NonLethal Technologies Inc., a company based in Pennsylvania. That gap will now presumably be filled by Chinese firms, which should be more than willing to fill the purchase orders of the Hong Kong police. Trump's move, heralded as an early Thanksgiving present by the protesters in Hong Kong, was met with swift condemnation from China amid ongoing trade talks with the US. But was it a casino roll by Trump to legitimize his credentials on the foreign policy field? Or a risky attempt to show Beijing, amid trade talks, that America means business? Words of Anger from Beijing The Chinese Foreign Ministry responded to the US legislation with a statement that read, ""The US has been disregarding facts and distorting truth. It openly backs violent criminals who rampantly smashed facilities, set fire, assaulted innocent civilians, trampled on the rule of law and jeopardized social order."" Trump's sign-off is being widely celebrated by the anti-government protest movement, which first erupted in June over a bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be extradited to China, calling into question the ""one country, two systems"" principle -- and Hong Kong's judicial independence -- after the UK handed the former colony back to China in 1997. While Hong Kong's chief executive pulled the bill in September, many protesters considered the move too little, too late. During one of my visits to Hong Kong this summer, I stood among tens of thousands of mostly young protesters in front of the US Consulate in the central business district. Many carried American flags and at the time it seemed uncertain whether the Trump administration, eager to seal a trade deal with China, would risk jeopardizing progress on that front with punitive legislation. ""We are here to let Americans know that the US stands for freedom,"" one male protester told me. There has been strong bipartisan support for the Hong Kong protests, and both bills were passed unanimously in the US Senate last Tuesday. Even if Trump vetoed the bills, there was enough support for Congress to override him. He likely did the math and decided to sign the legislation rather than open up a new duel with Congress. What this means for trade talks Beijing despises suffering a loss of face. Perhaps it knows that the legislation signed by Trump comes with bad PR. But on the other hand it also knows Trump -- who may not wish to further damage relations with China or hurt US companies with substantial operations in the city -- will likely use the provisions sparingly, if at all. The good news is that there is little indication that China plans to retaliate by escalating its year-long trade war with the US, or by suspending trade talks. With three weeks to go before painful tariffs kick in, China seems unwillingly to turn the Hong Kong legislation into a major trade irritant. China is eager for a deal, and it knows that Trump, pressured by growing desperation among his base (such as farmers) ahead of a presidential election, needs to seal a deal. On the other hand, China, faced with a slowing economy that could trigger unrest, has little room to maneuver. An Uncertain Future Ahead for Hong Kong What happens next for Hong Kong is uncertain. The US support comes just days after the pro-democracy movement won 17 of the 18 district councils in a local election on Sunday. The resounding victory was a strong rebuke of the embattled government of Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who said Monday her administration will ""seriously reflect"" on the outcome. In the run-up to the Sunday elections, the protest movement, which is said to be leaderless, was able to suspend all violent protests -- reportedly in the hopes that it wouldn't give the government an excuse to postpone the election. But the protest movement says it will continue until all of its demands are met -- including an independent inquiry into alleged police violence and misconduct, a general amnesty for arrested protesters, repeal of the classification of the protesters as ""rioters"" and complete universal suffrage. Protesters are also calling for Lam to step down from her post as chief executive. The Hong Kong government and Beijing, however, show little willingness to give into the demands, especially for more democratic rights. Xi has said that any attempt to divide China would end with ""bodies smashed and bones ground to powder. From Beijing's point of view, an unruly Hong Kong presents a serious threat, especially if the unrest spreads to the mainland. A sign of China's unwillingness to allow Hong Kong too much autonomy came last week when it called into question local courts' right to declare laws unconstitutional if they contravene the Basic Law or Hong Kong's mini constitution. The move was prompted by the Hong Kong court decision to strike down a controversial anti-mask law that was heavily pushed by Chinese officials. By messing with Hong Kong's rule of law -- a bedrock of the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement which accounted for the city becoming an international financial hub -- China signaled the extent it will go to enforce its will. Even if Beijing shows restraint towards Hong Kong, it is unlikely that the protests will fizzle out on their own. During my last two visits, I detected an astonishing amount of resentment towards the government, the tiny elite that dominates its economy, and the Hong Kong police force. The free-wheeling Hong Kong as we know it is not yet lost, but China is in no mood to tolerate dissent. In light of China's repression in regions like Tibet and Xinjiang, it seems the international community, including the United States, has little leverage to support the protest movement in the long run. The passage of US legislation only plays into Beijing's narrative that dark forces from abroad are behind the Hong Kong protest movement. But at least a US president not known for his defense of human rights -- and who has remained mostly silent on the protests -- has given the young Hong Kong people on the streets a badly needed jolt of adrenaline.

US Navy  The Pentagon made a very unusual move yesterday and forced Navy Secretary Richard Spencer to resign for his part in ongoing tensions between the White House and the Pentagon over the discipline of a Navy SEAL. Spencer allegedly went outside his chain of command to propose a ""secret agreement with the White House"" to end the standoff, according to a senior defense official. President Trump has vocally supported the SEAL, Eddie Gallagher, who is one of three service members facing war crimes allegations. Gallagher posed with the dead body of an ISIS fighter, which is against regulations, and could be kicked out of the force as a result. Trump has openly criticized the Navy's handling of Gallagher's case and said he would not let the Navy discipline him. Against advice from the Pentagon, he officially restored Gallagher's rank last week and pardoned the two other service members. However, yesterday military officials announced the White House will not intervene in the review.  2. Hong Kong  The people of Hong Kong went to the polls this weekend in what was considered a de facto referendum on six months of violent unrest in the city. The results were abundantly clear: Pro-democracy candidates won the district council elections in a landslide, unseating several high-profile pro-government leaders and taking nearly 90% of the seats up for grabs. A record-breaking 71% of the city's population voted. Experts say the historic outcome is a sign that the people of Hong Kong are committed to democracy and political reform, and citizens are hoping the results will point a way forward from the city's current state of unrest.  3. Impeachment investigation Scheduled public hearings are over and Democratic House aides will likely spend Thanksgiving week drafting a report that will spell out the case for impeachment. There are still some big witnesses House Democrats have pressured to testify, like former national security adviser John Bolton, but they're not going to force the issue. Meanwhile, one of Trump's top defenders may need to do some defending of his own. Late last Friday, news broke that an indicted associate of Rudy Giuliani would be willing to tell Congress that Devin Nunes met with an ex-Ukrainian official last year to discuss digging up dirt on Joe Biden. He's the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee -- the group leading the impeachment investigation centered around Trump asking Ukraine to dig up dirt on the Biden family. Nunes has disputed the report. 4. Egypt  The offices of Mada Masr, one of the last independent news outlets in Egypt, was raided by security forces yesterday. Four of the publication's staff, including the editor-in-chief and news editor, were detained and later released. The raid was condemned by several international rights organizations, and is a worrying development in the country's ongoing political tensions. In September, a wave of rare anti-government protests swept Egypt as citizens demanded the resignation of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Sisi was elected president in 2014, but he has since secured legislative powers that extended his term in office longer than the Egyptian constitution allows. Mada Masr's journalism has exposed corruption, security violations and the inner workings of the government, even in the face of nationwide crackdowns on reporting freedoms.  5. Brexit All Boris Johnson wants for Christmas is a Brexit vote. The UK's Prime Minister promised a speedy new vote on his Brexit deal and a lot of funding pledges if Conservatives win Britain's general election on December 12th. Johnson's Conservative party rolled out their manifesto yesterday, which included a ""triple lock"" on income tax, national insurance and VAT rates, a childcare program, an Australian-style points based immigration system, plus pledges for 20,000 new police officers and 50,000 extra nurses. Johnson also promised an extra £1 billion for social care and a £2 billion plan to fill potholes around the country. Keep in mind: Whatever happens election-wise, promise-wise or pothole-wise, the new Brexit deadline as set by the EU is January 31st.

22	https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/asia/china-us-hong-kong-act-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 1:17 AM ET, Thu November 21, 2019	Beijing vents fury at Washington over Hong Kong Human Rights Act	"Hong Kong (CNN)Chinese officials and state media have reacted with fury to the almost-unanimous passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act by the US House of Representatives on Wednesday. Though the bill has yet to go before US President Donald Trump for consideration, China wasted little time in condemning the vote, with the state-owned People's Daily describing it as ""a piece of waste paper,"" and a ""serious provocation against the entire Chinese people"" in an editorial published Thursday. ""If the US side goes its own way, China will take effective measures to resolutely counteract it, and all consequences must be fully borne by the US,"" the editorial said. The potential showdown risks undermining ongoing trade talks between Washington and Beijing during a critical juncture. Trump, who has yet to confirm whether he will sign the act, has so far appeared reticent to challenge China on the issue of Hong Kong, even promising Chinese President Xi Jinping in October that the US would remain silent on the city's ongoing pro-democracy protests while trade talks continued. The US government treats semi-autonomous Hong Kong, which has its own legal and political systems, differently from the Chinese mainland when it comes to trade and export controls. Should it become law, the Hong Kong Act would require the US government to annually confirm that those freedoms were being maintained by Beijing -- failure to do so could result in Washington withdrawing the city's special trading status, a massive blow to the Hong Kong economy. Additionally, the bill also lays out a process for the President to impose sanctions and travel restrictions on those who are found to be knowingly responsible for arbitrary detention, torture, forced confession of any individual in Hong Kong, or other violations of internationally recognized human rights in the Asian financial hub. 'Violation of international law' The legislation, which is aimed at safeguarding freedoms in Hong Kong, comes as protests in the city near their sixth month. Chinese state-run media has been ramping up its criticism of the Hong Kong protests as the demonstrations have grown increasingly violent in recent weeks, even as momentum has sped up for the legislation in Washington. Writing in his daily newsletter, Sinocism, China expert Bill Bishop, said that state television CCTV had 11 segments criticizing the US and the legislation during its evening news on Wednesday night. State-run tabloid the Global Times said instead of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, it should be called the ""Support Hong Kong Violence Act."" The Chinese government has repeatedly called on the US to stop ""interfering"" in their internal affairs, even accusing Washington repeatedly of being partially behind the lengthy demonstrations in Hong Kong. Speaking in Beijing on Wednesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang called the bill a ""serious violation of international law"" and said the Chinese government opposed and condemned it. ""I'd like to stress once again that Hong Kong is part of China, and Hong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs. We urge the US to grasp the situation, stop its wrongdoing before it's too late, and immediately take measures to prevent this act from becoming law,"" he said. The legislation has already passed the US Senate in its current form, meaning it now heads to the White House for President Trump's signature. But despite the strong support in the US Congress, there is no indication at this stage whether or not Trump will sign it. "	CNN
23	https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/20/asia/simon-cheng-china-torture-allegations-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 9:27 PM ET, Wed November 20, 2019	Former British consulate worker says he was tortured in China over UK's role in Hong Kong protests	"Hong Kong (CNN)A former employee of the British consulate in Hong Kong has alleged that he was tortured in China and interrogated by secret police about the city's long-running pro-democracy protests. Simon Cheng, a 28-year-old Hong Kong citizen who was detained for 15 days while on a trip to mainland China in August, claimed in a Facebook statement Wednesday that he was beaten, blindfolded, deprived of sleep, chained spread-eagled and forced to hold stress positions for hours at a time. Cheng alleged Chinese secret police repeatedly interrogated him about the UK's role in Hong Kong's protests, and about his own participation and that of his friends. In allegations that could inflame the protesters in Hong Kong and reinforce fears of many in the city, Cheng claimed that Chinese police told him ""batches of Hong Kong protesters"" had been ""caught, delivered and detained in mainland China."" CNN could not independently verify Cheng's claims. China has repeatedly accused Western countries, including the UK and United States, of interfering in the semi-autonomous Chinese city and influencing the protests that have roiled Hong Kong for almost six months. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab appeared to endorse many of Cheng's claims Wednesday, saying in a statement that his ""mistreatment"" while in detention ""amounts to torture."" ""Simon Cheng was a valued member of our team. We were shocked and appalled by the mistreatment he suffered while in Chinese detention, which amounts to torture,"" Raab said. Raab said he has summoned the Chinese ambassador ""to express our outrage at the brutal and disgraceful treatment of Simon in violation of China's international obligations. I have made clear we expect the Chinese authorities to investigate and hold those responsible to account."" Responding to Cheng's claims that he was tortured, China's Foreign Minister spokesman Geng Shuang said at a press briefing Wednesday that the Chinese public security department ""guaranteed all of his rights and interests according to law."" Cheng ""also made a full confession about his illegal actions,"" Geng said. Geng also commented on the UK Foreign Office announcement that it has summoned the Chinese ambassador to the UK over the matter. ""I think China would firmly oppose relevant remarks from the British side. We express our great indignation towards the UK's recent series of mistaken remarks and actions,"" he said. The backstory Cheng, who worked as a trade and investment officer for the British Consulate General Hong Kong, was detained by Chinese authorities after traveling to the mainland city of Shenzhen, on August 8. Beijing confirmed that Cheng had been held in administrative detention for violating China's Security Administration Punishment Law, which covers a range of offenses deemed too minor to be crimes. The law is often used as a preliminary measure that allows police to investigate a suspect before deciding whether to prosecute. Chinese state-owned tabloid the Global Times reported at the time that Cheng had been detained for ""solicitation of prostitution."" In a statement, Cheng's family said the prostitution allegations were a ""joke."" In the past, China has been criticized for arresting dissidents and activists on trumped up charges, including sex crimes. In his Facebook statement Wednesday, Cheng claimed that if he cooperated with officials on the prostitution charge, he was told he would ""face a less hard treatment."" Cheng's arrest came during widespread protests in Hong Kong over a bill that would allow extradition to mainland China. While the bill is now withdrawn, the protests -- which remain ongoing -- have grown in intensity in recent months and now include calls for greater democracy. At the time of his arrest, friends feared that Cheng's detention might in fact have been linked to the protests, noting that he had shared pro-democracy images on social media and had voiced support for the city's ongoing protest movement. His detention followed reports at the time that Chinese immigration officials were regularly searching travelers' phones and bags as they crossed the border for evidence they had taken part in demonstrations. Cheng said in the Wednesday statement that he supports and took part in the protests ""but did nothing illegal or illegitimate during the events."" He said the British consulate had tasked staff to collect information about the status of protests, which included joining online forums and speaking with protesters. He said he knew people from the mainland who had been arrested in Hong Kong after taking part in the protests. During his business trip to Shenzhen, Cheng said he collected money from the family of one such protester for his court case. Allegations of torture While in detention, Cheng said he was transported in a van to another site, where he was beaten and forced into stress positions, such as holding a squat for hours. ""They beat me every time I failed to do so using something like sharpened batons,"" Cheng said in the statement. ""I was hung (handcuffed and shackled) on a steep X-Cross doing a spread-eagled pose for hours after hours. I was forced to keep my hands up, so blood cannot be pumped up my arms. It felt extremely painful,"" he said. Cheng said that he was deprived of sleep, placed in solitary confinement and forced to sign confessions. He claimed his interrogators accused him of being a British spy, a mastermind of the protests, and a ""British proxy"" to incite the unrest. Cheng alleged police were keen to find out about the inner workings of the protest movement, including how it was organized and key activists involved. He said he was shown photographs and told to write down the names of anyone he knew and their role in the protests. After 15 days Cheng was released and sent back to Hong Kong but he believed that mainland Chinese authorities could abduct him at any time. ""They clearly stated that if I receive media interviews and speak out anything other than 'soliciting prostitution' publicly, I will be taken back to mainland China from Hong Kong,"" he said. Following the ordeal, Cheng said he fled to an undisclosed third country ""for security reasons"" and is seeking asylum. He said that he was asked to resign from his position at the consulate this month and had ""started negotiations on the solution and severance package with the UK Government."" In his statement, Raab said that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office was working to support Cheng, ""including to come to the UK."" ""Now my future is still uncertain and insecure,"" Cheng said. ""I won't give up the fight for human rights, peace, freedom and democracy for the rest of my life, no matter the danger, discrimination and retaliation I will face."""	CNN

Dunkin' is scrapping foam cups in favor of more eco-friendly (yet less iconic) paper versions. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Fresno shooting  A shooting at a football watch party in Fresno yesterday ended with four people dead, six others wounded and very few answers as to who's responsible. Authorities say an unknown suspect walked into the yard of a home and began shooting into a crowd. There's no indication the suspect knew anyone there, and police haven't published any details about the suspect's appearance or a possible vehicle description. After the shooting, officers were going door to door to collect security camera footage and possible witness statements to get more information.  2. Impeachment investigation The impeachment drama doesn't even stop on the weekends anymore. President Trump spent part of yesterday tweeting attacks against Jennifer Williams, an aid to Vice President Mike Pence who said in a deposition that Trump's July 25th call with Ukraine was ""inappropriate."" Williams is one of the people set to testify publicly this week, and the latest witness to face attacks from the President for her cooperation in the investigation. On Saturday, House impeachment investigators released a transcript of Williams' closed door deposition, as well as the deposition transcripts from Gordon Sondland, the American envoy to the European Union; and former NSC official Tim Morrison. The big takeaway from these releases: Morrison's account seems to corroborate Sondland's claim that he was directed by President Trump in his dealings with Ukraine, including an insistence that the country open investigations into the Biden family.  3. Hong Kong  It was a weekend of intense battles and prolonged standoffs between police and protesters in Hong Kong. Protesters are still holing up in some of the city's biggest universities, and police are hoping to wait them out. At Hong Kong Polytechnic University, anywhere from 100 to 1,000 protesters remain inside despite police orders to leave. Some protesters have been reluctant to come out of the university for fear of being beaten and arrested by police -- which happened to another group that fled earlier in the day. Meanwhile, some pro-democracy politicians in the city are upset after members of the Chinese military were spotted cleaning up Hong Kong's protest-marred streets. The politicians want to know if Hong Kong's government requested public security and disaster relief assistance from China in response to the ongoing violence.  4. 2020 elections  Two weeks ago, Kentucky upset the status quo by electing a Democratic governor despite its traditionally red leanings. This weekend, Louisiana followed suit. Governor John Bel Edwards defeated his Republican opponent in a runoff election on Saturday, and his victory will undoubtedly be used as another measuring stick of President Trump's influence leading up to the 2020 election. Trump obviously supported Republican candidate Eddie Rispone and encouraged voters to ""send a message to corrupt Democrats in Washington."" Louisiana's election results kick off what is sure to be another interesting week on the campaign trail. Ten Democratic candidates will gather in Atlanta on Wednesday for the next debate. Pete Buttigieg in particular will be coming into the debate on a high note. According to a new weekend poll, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, now holds a clear lead in the ever-important caucus state of Iowa.  5. Prince Andrew Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second son, sat for an interview with the BBC about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and...yikes, it did not go well. The Prince referred to Epstein's history of sexual assault as him conducting himself ""in a manner unbecoming"" and revealed Epstein was invited to the 18th birthday party of the Prince's daughter, Princess Beatrice, even though Epstein was at the time subject to an arrest warrant for the sexual assault of a minor. For context, one of Epstein's accusers said in 2015 that Epstein forced her to perform sex acts with several prominent men when she was 17, including Prince Andrew. All of them have denied the allegations. This latest interview was the first time Prince Andrew has spoken publicly about the allegations, and the result drew almost universal condemnation.

25	https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/tech/tencent-earnings-alibaba-stock/index.html	Updated 7:51 AM ET, Thu November 14, 2019	Tencent vs. Alibaba: Why one Chinese titan is slumping while the other soars	"Hong Kong (CNN Business)Chinese giant Tencent (TCEHY) is in a slump. The company's stock fell 2.3% in Hong Kong on Thursday, making it the day's worst performer on the Hang Seng Index (HSI). It was also Tencent's biggest daily percentage drop in three weeks. Investors were dispirited by a lackluster earnings report. On Wednesday in New York, the WeChat owner said that net profit for the third quarter dropped 13% compared to a year ago. It partly blamed a slide in revenue from PC games and advertising, particularly on its video streaming platform. The sluggish performance highlights a divergence between two of China's most valuable tech companies: Tencent's earnings miss comes the same week its longtime rival, Alibaba (BABA), is riding a very public wave of prosperity. On Monday, Alibaba once again broke its record for Singles Day, the world's biggest annual shopping event that continuously rakes in more than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. Two days later, the e-commerce titan confirmed after months of speculation that it would hold a splashy secondary listing in Hong Kong. It aims to raise up to $13.4 billion in what would likely be the world's second-largest public offering this year. To be clear, the two are fundamentally different companies. Alibaba's core business is e-commerce, while Tencent is primarily known for WeChat, the ubiquitous ""super-app"" that can be used for anything from social networking to digital payments. Tencent also has a huge gaming business, which includes popular titles like ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"" (PUBG) and ""Call of Duty: Mobile."" The two companies have ""performed on par historically,"" internet research analysts at Bernstein have pointed out. In an August research note, they wrote that ""over the past 20 years, their earnings and market caps are similar, and both grew at around 30% annually."" But Alibaba's stock has done much better this year, rising 33% compared to Tencent's 3% growth. Alibaba is also outperforming the broader New York Stock Exchange (NYA) by about 15%, while Tencent has edged the Hang Seng Index (HSI) by 1%. Bernstein predicted earlier this year that Tencent's revenue will grow slower than Alibaba's for the next three years because the WeChat owner's business is spread out across several segments that are growing at different paces. ""Alibaba grows better because the core business remains strong,"" they wrote. Tencent, which is the world's largest gaming company, was hit hard by a regulatory crackdown on the sector in China last year. While the firm has started to bounce back — it said this week that revenue from online games and smartphone games both increased year-over-year — investors are still wary of further roadblocks. Any ""unsuccessful launch of new games"" is a major potential risk in the company's outlook, analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note Wednesday. Tencent has other challenges, such as China's economic slowdown, which has been hurting the online advertising sector. The company was also caught in the NBA's geopolitical crisis in China last month, after a team manager's tweet expressing support for the Hong Kong protests forced its Chinese partners to cut ties with the league. Tencent is the exclusive digital partner for the NBA in China, and canceled the streaming of two preseason games during the controversy. On Wednesday, Tencent president Martin Lau said that he hopes the NBA problem ""resolves itself."" Tencent is also getting dwarfed in an important part of its business: cloud services. While revenue from that unit grew by a whopping 80% in the last quarter, it still came in at 4.7 billion Chinese yuan ($669 million), well below Alibaba's latest intake of 9.3 billion Chinese yuan ($1.3 billion) for its own cloud division. Overall, however, most analysts remain extremely bullish on Tencent, citing its ability to grow its fintech business and expand mobile gaming as a way to rebound. The average recommendation on the company is ""strong buy,"" according to data provider Refinitiv. Bernstein analysts said Wednesday that Tencent's mobile gaming and advertising revenue is likely to accelerate in the coming quarters, and its video streaming business should also stage a recovery. ""The worst is behind,"" they wrote in a research note. CNN Business' Paul R. La Monica contributed to this report."	CNN

(You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Hong Kong  Protests in Hong Kong have been escalating for five months now, and several serious incidents this weekend may mark a new boiling point. A traffic police officer shot a 21-year-old protester in the torso, sparking renewed outrage and violence. (Police say the protester is expected to survive.) Hours after the shooting, a man who confronted a group of pro-democracy protesters was doused in a flammable liquid and set alight. Amid the violence, a police officer appeared to drive his motorcycle into a crowd and has been suspended by the force. All of this escalating unrest follows the death of a 22-year-old student on Friday, who passed away after falling from a parking garage during a demonstration. The surge in violence has taken a toll on the economy: Hong Kong stocks suffered their worst day in more than three months on Monday.  2. Impeachment Inquiry  Could this be the biggest week yet for the House impeachment investigation? Those closed-door testimonies are about to become public, and Democrats will trot out a stable of career State Department employees who will testify under oath to things they've already talked about in private. On the docket: Bill Taylor, still the top State Department official in Ukraine; US Diplomat George Kent; and former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Not scheduled to appear: The unknown whistleblower whose alarm uncovered Trump's alleged effort to use financial aid to Ukraine as a bargaining chip to further his own political interests. Republican leaders like Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham want the whistleblower to come forward and testify. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff says the whistleblower's claims have been corroborated, so an appearance would be redundant. 3. Australia fires  More than 70 dangerous bushfires are burning across the Australian state of New South Wales today, threatening thousands of people and bringing a ""catastrophic"" fire threat level to the Sydney region. It's the worst threat level ever issued for Sydney under the current system, which was introduced in 2009. At least three people have died as a result of the blazes, and more than 100 homes have been lost. Strong winds, high temperatures and low humidity in the area have increased fire worries, and the state is under a seven-day state of emergency. While Sydney, with its population of 4.6 million people, is of particular concern, fire officials pointed out the greatest fire risk lies in rural areas outside the city center. The cloud of smoke can be seen as far away as New Zealand. 4. Bolivia Bolivian President Evo Morales and Vice President Álvaro García Linera resigned yesterday amid growing outrage after an international audit found the results of last month's general election could not be validated because of ""serious irregularities."" The October elections sparked protests across the country. Thousands of demonstrators accused electoral authorities of manipulating the vote count in favor of Morales, the country's longtime socialist leader who was seeking his fourth term. Now that Morales is out, even more uncertainty is coming down the road as Bolivians must go back to the polls for a new general election. Morales was president for 14 years, and there isn't a clear successor to his administration. 5. Winter weather  Winter is DEFINITELY here. The US is in for a record-breaking Arctic blast this week that could cause temperatures in some part of the country to plummet to 30 degrees below average. The National Weather Service predicts that more than 200 record lows could be tied or set from Monday to Wednesday. The Great Plains area will probably get hit first, and then the cold will move east over the week. Texas, Oklahoma and parts of the Ohio Valley may see record lows on Tuesday, and the Deep South and the Gulf Coast will feel the freeze on Wednesday.

27	https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/business/hong-kong-protests-disney/index.html	Updated 4:45 AM ET, Fri November 8, 2019	Disney says Hong Kong protests could wipe out $275 million in theme park profit	Hong Kong (CNN Business)Hong Kong's political crisis is hitting the local Disneyland hard. Disney (DIS) reported strong earnings on Thursday, but flagged mounting losses at its theme park in Hong Kong, where protests have gripped the city for months and walloped its tourism industry. If the current trends continue, operating income at Hong Kong Disneyland could fall by $275 million in Disney's current fiscal year, which ends in September 2020, the company's chief financial officer Christine McCarthy said during an earnings call. The local theme park was a drag on international business last quarter, when operating income at Hong Kong Disneyland fell $55 million, offsetting growth at parks in Paris and Shanghai. McCarthy warned profit could fall by $80 million in the current quarter. As a whole, Disney's parks unit — which it breaks out in its earnings report as parks, experiences and products — brought in $1.4 billion in operating income for the fourth quarter, a 17% increase over the same time last year. Disney's warning underscores the gloomy picture for Hong Kong's economy. Official data released last week confirmed what many had feared: The city has plunged into recession, after months of protests have forced shops to close, paralyzed public transportation and scared off tourists. Visitors to Hong Kong plummeted 37% in the third quarter, according to the city's financial secretary. Hotels were on average only two-thirds full, a drop of 28% compared to the same period a year earlier. With no immediate resolution to the city's political crisis in the cards, economists say Hong Kong's first recession in a decade could extend into the new year. 	CNN
28	https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/06/uk/uk-china-universities-influence-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 12:12 AM ET, Wed November 6, 2019	UK lawmakers warn of 'alarming evidence' of Chinese meddling on university campuses	"Hong Kong (CNN)British lawmakers have warned of what they say is ""alarming evidence"" of Chinese influence on university campuses, and the potential risks to academic freedom of UK institutions targeting partnerships in China. The United Kingdom is the latest country to warn of potential meddling by Chinese authorities in the education system, after years of universities aggressively targeting students from China -- who pay significantly more than British or European students. ""Despite the fact that there are now over 100,000 Chinese students in the UK, the issue of Chinese influence has been the subject of remarkably little debate compared to that in Australia, New Zealand and the US,"" a report from the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said this week. CNN is seeking comment from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding allegations in the report. The UK is one of the most popular overseas destinations for Chinese students, along with the US, Australia and Canada, according to a recent survey, and multiple British universities -- including Liverpool and Nottingham -- have set up partnerships or other close relationships with Chinese colleges. These partnerships -- which are both economic and academic -- as well as the huge financial benefit Chinese students bring, make British universities vulnerable to pressure from the Chinese government, warned the House of Commons report. ""Universities have a strong incentive to establish overseas partnerships to secure funding and enhance collaboration on research projects, but this should be balanced with potential risks to academic freedom,"" lawmakers said. Multiple British academics are quoted in the report giving examples of Chinese political pressure, including officials linked to the Confucius Institute -- a Chinese government funded cultural and language program which has a presence on most UK campuses -- allegedly confiscating papers which mention Taiwan at a European academic conference. ""Where do you draw the line? When the head of the office in Beijing turns up at a conference in Portugal and confiscates the brochures and the papers and tears out all the pages that mention Taiwan and will not let the academics see them?"" Christopher Hughes, a professor at the London School of Economics, told lawmakers according to a transcript. ""Do we say that is unacceptable influence and interference? Do we start to say that maybe these organizations should not be on our campus? That maybe they have an agenda that does not fit our values?"" Hughes added that the presence of Confucius Institutes on British campuses -- where they are often the only place where students can learn Chinese -- is an example of subtle pressure from Beijing, which can have an effect on broader questions of academic freedom. ""We know the big Ts—Taiwan, Tibet and Tiananmen. Now, there is Hong Kong,"" Hughes said. ""These things will be marginalized and squeezed out as academics have to work with the Confucius Institute and the Confucius Institute itself gets legitimacy."" Hong Kong was an issue brought up by other witnesses interviewed by lawmakers, and the ongoing anti-government protests in the semi-autonomous Chinese city have already led to scuffles and disputes on campuses across the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Chinese students in these countries have repeatedly staged counter-demonstrations to rallies held in sympathy with the Hong Kong protests, and while many students are motivated by patriotism and disapproval of the increasingly violent unrest, there have been allegations that local Chinese diplomats have played a hand in the demonstrations. While academics who spoke to the committee were concerned about foreign influence, university groups pushed back on the claim, with Bill Rammell of MillionPlus, which represents 20 universities in the UK, saying he had ""not heard one piece of evidence"" backing it up. The Russell Group, which represents some of the UK's most prestigious universities, told lawmakers that ""we are not aware of any significant or systematic attempts to influence university activity by foreign actors in any of the ways outlined in your letter."" Concern over potential Chinese influence on campuses is not limited to the UK, and academics in New Zealand and Australia in particular have raised the alarm over potential threats to academic freedom due to meddling by Chinese diplomats and self-censoring in order to safeguard Chinese student fees.

Although the company just announced a new shooter game and more expansions to its nostalgic franchises, including ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Hearthstone,"" some gamers say they are hesitant about giving the company their time and money. The American company has come under fire after it banned Hong Kong player Ng ""Blitzchung"" Wai Chung in October for shouting the popular protest slogan ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"" during a livestreamed post-match interview. Blizzard (ATVI) said the act violated its competition rules because it brought the player into ""public disrepute,"" offended the public and damaged Blizzard's image. Ng was initially stripped of his potential winnings and banned from competing for the next year. Last month, social media reacted in outrage at news of the ban. Players posted images of themselves uninstalling or canceling subscriptions to hugely popular Blizzard games. Blizzard eventually shortened Ng's ban and restored his winnings. It later banned an American University team for holding up a poster that said ""Free Hong Kong, boycott Blizz."" The company's president apologized Friday. ""We moved too quickly in our decision and then to make matters worse, we were too slow to talk with all of you,"" said president J. Allen Brack at the kick-off event on Friday. ""I am sorry and I accept accountability."" But many onlookers, who are attending the annual BlizzCon gaming convention in Anaheim, California, or tuning in online, said it wasn't enough. ""The apology Blizzard made was absolutely PR damage control,"" said Fadel Ragheb, 23, a gamer, streamer and podcaster in Montreal who tuned into the event online. ""Having the CEO come up on stage and expect everyone to get over it by basically saying 'sorry' and then showing a game trailer for 'Diablo IV' shows just how much they want to bury the story, instead of tackling it head on and trying to fix their image."" Mass protests in Hong Kong, which began five months ago over a controversial China extradition law, have grown into more violent demonstrations over fears around Beijing's tightening grip on the important financial hub. China denies the charge. The protests have been a thorn in China's side and have ensnared many Western companies, including the NBA. Some gamers believe Blizzard's move to punish Ng was an assault on free speech and a bow to China. Blizzard has said that its interests in China did not influence its decision to ban Blitzchung, but gamers remain skeptical. ""I don't see any legitimate change happening in the future. It sounds like they're hoping people won't pay attention to the language used and will just forget about it,"" said Eli Jackson, 27, a gamer who works as a manager at a Las Vegas shipping center and who also tuned in online. Blizzard did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN Business on Saturday. Many protesters also showed up on Saturday outside BlizzCon after attending events on Friday. They handed out thousands of t-shirts to attendees on both days. Some wore shirts protesting Blizzard or expressing a pro-Hong Kong stance. On Friday, American University student and esports player Torin Wright, 19, shared a poem he had wrote earlier in the summer as the Hong Kong protests ramped up. ""The wounding from your massacre, wading into rough swamps, wondering like childhood's touch,"" he read. He told CNN Business Saturday, ""I chose to read it in place of my speech because I felt it was a great way to show how people's different passions can be expressed in free speech."" Charles Lam, 46, a protester with the nonprofit Hong Kong Forum, Los Angeles said: ""Blizzard is not in the thought police business. I hate to see the company be drawn into that."" The dissatisfaction with Blizzard's response could reverberate to sales, some players said. Blizzcon attendee Andrew Kane, 32, a game developer who has been in the industry for 9 years, said, he and his three friends were thinking of delaying their purchases of any new Blizzard games until the company resolved the issue. But other gamers think the extended fallout will be minimal. ""It would unfortunately be very uncharacteristic of the gaming community to stick to their guns on this issue for an extended period of time,"" Jackson, of Las Vegas, said. ""Gamers are largely consumers first and foremost, so game announcements and trailers are like dangling a shiny object in front of a cat."" Nomura Instinet analyst Andrew Marok told CNN Business, ""There are certainly a number of gamers who feel very strongly about this issue, but we think it's a relatively small part of Blizzard's total player base. From a business perspective, we think the company's emphasis will continue to be on producing high-quality games and that's what will drive results."" "	CNN

Protesters gathered outside the event to advocate for free speech, support the Hong Kong protests and demand an apology from Blizzard for actions it took against players who engaged in protests. ""We moved too quickly in our decision and then to make matters worse, we were too slow to talk with all of you,"" said president J. Allen Brack at the kick-off event on Friday. ""I am sorry and I accept accountability."" The American company has come under fire after it banned a Hong Kong player named Ng for shouting the popular protest slogan ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"" during a livestreamed post-match interview.

Social media reacted in outrage after the news of the ban broke: Players posted images of them uninstalling or canceling subscriptions to hugely popular Blizzard games. Blizzard eventually shortened Ng's ban and restored his winnings. Brack added, ""We will do better going forward. But our actions are going to matter more than any of these words. As you walk around this weekend, I hope it's clear how committed we are to people expressing themselves."" At the convention, Blizzard announced a sequel to the popular shooter game ""Overwatch,"" which is partly set in Toronto where heroes come to the aide of law enforcement. Still, like the original, it's a competitive game and a professional esport. The company also provided more details on the fourth version of its role-playing franchise ""Diablo,"" including an in-depth trailer and a playable demo for attendees. Some of the games Blizzard offers as a service, including ""World of Warcraft"" and the card game ""Hearthstone,"" received expansions this year, too. Nomura Instinet analysts describe the Blizzard pipeline as being in a ""dry spell,"" but this year's convention could be ""one of the busiest in recent memory."" Outside the event, Freedom Hong Kong, has been handing out 4,000 t-shirts with a pro-Hong Kong slogan to attendees. Fight for the Future — a non-profit that promotes digital rights — also organized a protest. Expected to speak are two students from American University, Casey Chambers and Torin Wright, who were suspended from Blizzard esports events last month after they held up a ""Free Hong Kong, boycott Blizz"" sign during a collegiate-level championship match in solidarity with Ng. ""I decided to go to Blizzcon to continue to share the message, but I am also holding out hope that we can convince Blizzard to change its mind and apologize about this,"" Chambers told CNN Business. Dayton Young, product director at Fight for the Future and protest organizer, said some people are flying to California to attend the protests. He added the initial events captured the attention not only of gamers but members of Congress, including Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who signed a public letter to Blizzard to ""look beyond the bottom line"" and protect freedom of speech. ""And that's really our crowd, as well,"" Young told CNN Business. ""We get people from all over the political spectrum with lots of different ideas and different goals for us."" In a statement ahead of the event, Blizzard said: ""We welcome open, constructive, and civil discussion of different perspectives at the show, and we do still plan to have fan Q&A at certain panels as we normally do. ...The safety and security of our attendees is and has always been a top priority, and every year we iterate with new measures to bring our event even more up-to-date."" The convention runs through Saturday evening. "	CNN
31	https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/29/asia/joshua-wong-council-election-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 3:00 AM ET, Tue October 29, 2019	Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong banned from running in local election	"Hong Kong (CNN)One of Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy activists has been barred from running in upcoming district council elections, as anti-government protests continue to rock the semi-autonomous Chinese city. Joshua Wong, who helped lead massive pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in 2014, became the only candidate banned from running in the November poll. Previously candidates have been barred from elections to the city's parliament, but not district councils, which handle local affairs. In a letter, the returning officer supervising Wong's election said he had not abandoned the belief that independence could be an option for Hong Kong's future. This would be in violation Hong Kong's de facto constitution, which states that the city is an inalienable part of China. Speaking at a press conference Tuesday, Wong said the decision ""is clearly politically driven."" ""I do not propose separatism as an option in the self-determination,"" Wong said. ""The returning officer has falsely interpreted my political stance."" He said the decision was due to his prominence as an activist, saying it was an ""order from Beijing, a political mission from Beijing."" Wong said he is ""actively considering"" appealing the ruling, and urged supporters to vote for pro-democracy candidates in the election. The district council election, set to be held on November 24, will be the first test of public opinion amid the city's biggest political storm since its handover to China in 1997. Protesters have been demanding an independent investigation into allegations of police brutality and greater democratic freedoms. More than 2,000 people have been arrested, with some protesters lighting fires and throwing petrol bombs in clashes with police. District councils are consultative bodies on local affairs in Hong Kong, and the election will return 452 councillors for a four-year term. Wong initially submitted his nomination on October 4, and has since received three letters from election officials asking him to clarify his political beliefs. The returning officer, Laura Liang Aron, explained in her letter that Wong has not distanced himself from Demosisto, a political party he founded in 2016, which she said has a ""consistent"" belief that Hong Kong independence should be an option in any future exercises of ""democratic self-determination."" She also said that while Wong had categorically stated he did not support Hong Kong independence, he only did so because Chinese President Xi Jinping had earlier warned that any attempt to split China would ""end in crushed bodies and shattered bones."" ""Both Demosisto and he were pressed to saying that they have given up the notion as a compromise, instead of a genuine intention,"" Aron said. The Hong Kong government said in a statement it ""agreed to and supported the decision by the Returning Officer,"" adding that ""there is no question of any political censorship, restriction of the freedom of speech or deprivation of the right to stand for elections."" Wong was the last candidate to receive an answer regarding his nomination. Josh Hawley, a Republican US senator from Missouri, urged the Hong Kong government to confirm Wong's candidacy in a tweet last Friday. ""Here's a test of Beijing's intentions toward Hong Kong: will they allow pro-democracy champion Joshua Wong to run ... or will they intervene & disbar him? The world is watching,"" he posted. Speaking at a press conference Tuesday, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam reiterated calls for protesters to stop ""extreme violence"" before starting a political dialogue to resolve grievances. In August, Wong and other high-profile democracy activists were arrested for charges relating to the ongoing Hong Kong protests, including ""inciting others to participate in unlawful assembly"" and ""organizing unauthorized assembly"", which could carry sentences of up to five years in prison if convicted. He has previously served time in jail over the mass protests in 2014. "	CNN

Markets in Asia were following last Friday's Wall Street gains, as investors appear confident the so-called ""phase one"" US-China trade agreement is going to happen. The US Trade Representative's office said on Friday that the two sides could be close to finalizing parts of a trade deal. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) rose 1.2% Monday morning, while China's Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP) advanced 0.7%, building on earlier gains. South Korea's Kospi (KOSPI) edged up 0.4% while Japan's Nikkei 225 (N225) increased 0.3%. The positive trade sentiment comes as WH Group, the world's largest pork producer, is set to report earnings in Hong Kong on Monday. China's pork industry has been decimated by African swine fever, and the crisis may be influencing how China approaches trade tensions with the United States. Before the trade war began, China was one of the biggest markets for US agricultural exports, and pork was a huge part of that relationship. Shares in WH Group were flat at the open, though moved higher to 0.4% just before noon in Hong Kong. HSBC (HBCYF) reports earnings later in the day, and the bank is expected to show signs of strain from the Hong Kong protests, now in their fifth month. The financial hub is a major source of profit for the London-based bank. HSBC's Hong Kong shares were up 1% midday. Hong Kong, meanwhile, has fallen into a technical recession, according to Hong Kong's financial secretary Paul Chan. In a blog post published on Sunday, Chan laid out the the economic problems facing the city, such as a double-digit plunge in tourism and a drop in retail sales. The financial hub could also play a role in ongoing trade talks between the United States and China. If the US Congress pushes forward on a threat on Hong Kong's special trade status with the United States, it could be one of the biggest risks to the mini trade agreement. During a private phone call in June, President Donald Trump promised Chinese President Xi Jinping that the US would remain quiet on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong while trade talks continued, two sources familiar with the call told CNN earlier this month.

33	https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/25/tech/tiktok-national-security/index.html	Updated 7:16 AM ET, Fri October 25, 2019	TikTok could threaten national security, US lawmakers say	"Hong Kong (CNN Business)TikTok, the viral short video app where millions of teens post comedy skits set to snappy music hooks, is facing a growing backlash in the United States. US lawmakers on both sides of the aisle warn that the app could pose a national security risk, and are calling on regulators and intelligence agencies to investigate TikTok's ties to China. Senators Chuck Schumer and Tom Cotton want the US intelligence community to assess the national security risks of TikTok and other Chinese-owned platforms, saying in a statement Thursday that such apps could be used to spy on US citizens or become targets of foreign influence campaigns like the Russian meddling campaign to influence the 2016 US presidential election. TikTok, owned by Beijing-based parent company Bytedance, has exploded in popularity and become one of the few Chinese-owned social media apps to gain traction in Western countries. The app was downloaded 177 million times last quarter, down 4% compared to the same period last year, according to mobile data firm Sensor Tower. But it was still the second most downloaded app worldwide, just behind Facebook (FB)-owned messaging platform WhatsApp. It also made $40 million in revenue on the iOS App store last quarter, and has amassed about 100 million users in the United States, according to Sensor Tower. TikTok is unavailable in China, though ByteDance owns a domestic version of the app there called Douyin. Because TikTok's parent company is based in China, it could be compelled ""to support and cooperate with intelligence work controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,"" the senators said, adding in a letter to the acting US Director of National Intelligence that ""there is no legal mechanism for Chinese companies to appeal if they disagree with a request."" TikTok said in a statement that it stores all US user data in the United States and backs it up in Singapore. ""Our data centers are located entirely outside of China, and none of our data is subject to Chinese law,"" the company said in a statement Friday. ""Further, we have a dedicated technical team focused on adhering to robust cybersecurity policies, and data privacy and security practices."" Earlier this month, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio called for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which vets overseas purchases of American businesses, to review TikTok's acquisition of rival app Musical.ly. His request came after the Washington Post published a story investigating the absence of posts about the Hong Kong protests on TikTok, compared to other social media platforms such as Twitter (TWTR) and Facebook. ""There continues to be ample and growing evidence that TikTok's platform for Western markets, including those in the United States, is censoring content that is not in line with the Chinese Government and Communist Party directives,"" Rubio said in a statement at the time. TikTok said in its Friday statement that it doesn't remove content based on sensitivities related to China. ""We have never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content and we would not do so if asked,"" TikTok said, adding that its US moderation team ""reviews content for adherence to our US policies — just like other US companies in our space.""

Huang Xueqin, also known as Sophia Huang, was taken by authorities around October 17, according to a friend who declined to be named due to the political sensitivity of the matter. CNN has reached out to Guangzhou police regarding Huang. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A reporter for multiple Chinese publications, Huang recently wrote about how she took part in the ongoing Hong Kong protests, which are often fiercely anti-Beijing. Friends said she had regularly gone to Hong Kong up until August. Yaqiu Wang, a researcher with Human Rights Watch and friend of Huang's said in a statement the journalist was intending to study a postgraduate degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in September but was summoned beforehand by Guangzhou police, who then confiscated her passport. ""(Beijing) is fearful that the protests in Hong Kong could inspire challenges to the government in the mainland, and any expression of ideas of freedom and democracy is a threat to its grip on power,"" Wang said, adding that more writers and activists were being detained in mainland China for voicing their support for the Hong Kong protests. Earlier this month, HRW called on Beijing to release Chinese activists held over the protests, listing three people confirmed to have been detained on suspicion of ""picking quarrels,"" a broad category which carries a sentence of up to five years in prison for first-time offenders. Multiple Chinese and Hong Kong residents have told CNN of having their phones and other personal items inspected by police as they crossed over the border between the city and mainland China. In August, an employee of the British consulate was detained for more than two weeks in China, which friends said was in relation to his participation in the protests. Taiwan last month warned citizens not to travel to Hong Kong or China after businessman Lee Meng-chu, 43, disappeared when he crossed the border from Hong Kong to the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen on August 19. Chinese officials said Lee is under investigation for ""allegedly engaged in illegal activities that endanger state security,"" even as authorities in Taiwan continued to demand more information about his case and condemned his detention. Huang has been a key figure in China's fledgling #MeToo movement. A 2018 survey she conducted found that 84% of the 416 female journalists surveyed had experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. ""There are so few people prosecuted because there are only so few victims who report,"" she told CNN in a 2018 interview. ""To most victims, it's shame."" "	CNN
35	https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/24/politics/pence-nba-nike-china/index.html	Updated 4:40 AM ET, Fri October 25, 2019	Pence says NBA akin to 'wholly owned subsidiary' of Beijing	"Washington (CNN)Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday accused the National Basketball Association of acting ""like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime"" in China, in a speech that also chided Beijing for economic and human rights abuses. The closely watched address was seen as a barometer of the US administration's approach to China as President Donald Trump works to complete a partial trade deal within the next few weeks. Over the summer, Trump ordered the speech delayed around the same time he told Chinese President Xi Jinping in a phone call he would remain quiet on Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed. The speech Pence delivered Thursday sought to balance conciliation on trade with a critique of China's human rights crackdowns, including in Hong Kong. His accusation against the NBA, along with the sneaker manufacturer Nike, of ranking business interests over American values stood in contrast to Trump's own willingness to prioritize trade talks over condemning Beijing's actions in Hong Kong. ""Some of the NBA's biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of other peoples,"" Pence said. He went on to say the league is ""siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech."" Pence was also critical of China's handling of the pro-democracy demonstrations, saying the country was curtailing ""rights and liberties"" in the city. And he accused the China of engaging in ""even more aggressive and destabilizing"" behavior over the past year. The tone of Pence's remarks were a subject of debate inside the administration, a person familiar with the speech said, and China watchers were listening closely to see how far he went in his criticism of China on human rights and economic malpractice. Pence sharply chastised China for its detention of Muslim Uighurs at detention camps in the western Xinjiang region and for the Hong Kong crackdown. ""Beijing has increased its interventions in Hong Kong and engaged in actions that curtail the rights and liberties that Hong Kong's people were guaranteed through a binding international agreement,"" he said. But he also sought to emphasize areas of cooperation and said the US was not ""seeking to contain China's development."" ""We want a constructive relationship with China's leaders, like we have with China's people,"" he said. A dispute emerged between the NBA and China earlier this month after the general manager of the Houston Rockets tweeted support of the Hong Kong protesters. The league was criticized during the fallout for being too beholden to Chinese authorities. As protests erupted in Hong Kong over the summer, Trump initially avoided harsh criticism of Xi or China, believing taking a firm line could imperil ongoing trade negotiations. During a private phone call in June, Trump promised Xi that the US would remain quiet on the pro-democracy protests while trade talks continued, two sources familiar with the call told CNN. Eventually, Trump warned that a ""bad"" outcome in Hong Kong could scuttle the trade talks, and encouraged Xi to arrive at a peaceful solution. Pence said Thursday the US supported the protesters, who have warned of encroaching influence from the central government in Beijing on their semi-autonomous status. ""We stand with you, we are inspired by you. We urge you to stay on the path of non-violent protest,"" Pence said. The NBA controversy threatened Nike, the NBA's official apparel partner, which has relied heavily on the Chinese market for sales growth in recent years. In the midst of the spat, some Nike stores in China had pulled Houston Rockets sneakers and other merchandise from their shelves, according to a report from Reuters. Losing out on sales of that gear could be especially problematic for Nike, as the Houston Rockets had been one of the most popular NBA teams in China thanks to Chinese player Yao Ming's eight-year career there. In his speech, Pence called Nike's decision to pull Rockets merchandise a move ""to join the Chinese government in protest against the Rockets general manager's seven-word tweet: 'Fight for Freedom, stand with Hong Kong.'"" Nike, Pence claimed, ""promotes itself as a so called 'social-justice champion"" but prefers ""checking its social conscience at the door"" when it comes to Hong Kong. The situation echoed an earlier episode in June, when Nike said it would not sell in China products from a collaboration with a Japanese designer, after the designer's comments in support of Hong Kong prompted backlash in China. Nike said at the time it removed those products from Chinese stores ""based on feedback from Chinese consumers."" Involvement in such an ideological clash is especially tricky for sports brands like the NBA and US footwear companies, which have taken progressive stands on many social issues -- diversity, LGBTQ+ rights, women's equality. The NBA and Nike did not have an immediate response to Pence's comments. Pence was seeking to strike a balance in his speech between fierce criticism of China's human rights record while keeping open channels for trade talks. Trump is still working toward that goal, with a meeting with Xi slated for next month in Chile where he hopes to ink the tenuous ""phase one"" trade agreement announced at the White House this month. CNN Business reporter Clare Duffy contributed to this report."	CNN
36	https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/23/asia/hong-kong-taiwan-murder-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 9:56 AM ET, Wed October 23, 2019	Murder suspect whose alleged crime sparked Hong Kong protests walks free	"Hong Kong (CNN)Protests in Hong Kong have affected everything from esports and the NBA to arguments about free speech on Australian university campuses and the US-China trade war. Chinese President Xi Jinping, Donald Trump and basketball star Lebron James have all been pulled in. But as the global consequences of almost four months of unprecedented unrest continue to be felt, the story that started it all has slipped from the headlines. On Wednesday, one of the central players in that story walked free from a Hong Kong prison on minor charges, after authorities say he confessed to killing his girlfriend but, so far, avoided prosecution for it. Chan Tong-kai was sentenced to prison by a judge in April 2019. Just over one year earlier, authorities say the then 19-year-old admitted to killing his girlfriend, 20-year-old Poon Hiu-wing, while the pair were in Taiwan. Poon would have been about 15 weeks pregnant at the time. Though Chan was arrested in March 2018 and soon confessed to the killing, according to police, that wasn't why he was before a judge in April. Because Hong Kong and Taiwan have no extradition agreement, and do not usually provide cross-border legal assistance -- and because they couldn't prove the alleged murder was planned in Hong Kong beforehand -- prosecutors in the city were unable to charge Chan with murder. Instead, he was charged with the more minor offense of money laundering, in relation to cash and other valuables he stole from Poon after allegedly killing her. An attempt by Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam to plug the extradition ""loophole"" with Taiwan, and at the same time allow suspects to be sent to China and Macao, led to months of intense anti-government protests, which were initially sparked by fears the extradition law could be used to rendition critics of Beijing across the border to face trial. Those protests show no signs of stopping, and have only grown more chaotic and violent in recent weeks. But on October 23, Chan -- whose lawyers did not respond to a request for comment -- walked free, after 19 months behind bars on the money laundering charges. What happens to him now is unclear. The Hong Kong government said Chan has offered to hand himself in to Taiwanese authorities, but how that will exactly take place is hotly contested. Taipei said it had requested Chan be handed into its custody in Hong Kong, along with his alleged confession and other documents relating to the case, but Hong Kong has pointed out Taiwanese police have no authority to operate in the city. ""The authority of Taiwan has no law enforcement power in Hong Kong. Chan is Taiwan's wanted person and his surrender decision is voluntary,"" Hong Kong's government said in a statement Wednesday. ""As he will be a free man after released from jail, the (Hong Kong) Government has no authority to impose any restrictive measures on him. He could go to Taiwan accompanied by persons of his choice. Upon arrival, the authority of Taiwan can arrest him."" Chan is currently a free man. Speaking outside Pik Uk Prison on Wednesday morning, he said that ""I understand that because of my irreversible wrongdoing, I have caused huge pain."" ""I am willing to pay the price for my impulsiveness and my wrongdoing, which is to turn myself in to the Taiwanese authority and serve my sentence there,"" Chan said. ""I can only say I am sorry. I hope everyone will forgive me, give me a chance to give back to the society."" Death at the Purple Garden Hotel ""She was a good daughter. In school, she was a good student,"" Poon Hiu-wing's mother told reporters in February. ""What did she do to deserve this? Our family never imagined that such a horrible thing could happen to such a nice girl."" According to court documents, Poon and Chan met in July 2017. On social media, Poon shared happy selfies of the two of them together. In one photo, she smiles at the camera, her eyes wide and her face framed by long, dark hair. She's holding Chan's arm as he stares into the camera, his bowl cut hair hiding his eyebrows. He has big ears which stick out from his hair, and a large birthmark under his left nostril. In February 2018, the couple took a holiday to Taiwan. Before they left for Taipei, Poon wrote on Facebook that Chan had described her as ""his first and last girlfriend."" Surveillance footage from the Purple Garden Hotel, verified by Taiwanese authorities, shows the couple returning soon after midnight on February 17. Chan is walking in front, carrying a large, apparently empty, pink suitcase with one hand. Poon follows a short distance behind him. According to Chan's confession, as presented in court, that suitcase would be central to what happened next. In a WhatsApp message to her mother, authorities say Poon said they'd be returning to Hong Kong later on the 17th. But while they were packing in the early hours of the morning, they started arguing. The spat soon turned into a blazing argument. According to Chan's confession, cited in court, Poon told him she was pregnant by her ex-boyfriend, not him. He says she then showed him a video of her having sex with another man. That's when the situation escalated, the court heard -- Chan hit Poon's head against the wall of their hotel room and began strangling her from behind with both hands. They fell onto the floor, where they struggled for about 10 minutes until Poon was dead. Confronted with the corpse of his pregnant girlfriend, Hong Kong officials say Chan turned again to the suitcase. He stuffed Poon's dead body into the pink case, folding her near in half to make her fit. He then threw her belongings into four plastic bags, according to court documents, and went to sleep. At 11:25 a.m. on February 17, surveillance footage shows Chan leaving the hotel alone. He's lugging a now apparently very heavy pink suitcase behind him, and it moves awkwardly over the cobbles on the street outside. He has a baseball cap pulled lower over his head, and a black mask over his face. He disposed of Poon's belongings in various trash bins near the hotel, according to court documents, and then dragged the suitcase to a nearby subway entrance. From Zhongshan station, Chan rode the red line north for 15 stops to Zhuwei station on the outskirts of Taipei, according to Taiwanese state media. There he started looking for a place to dump the body, eventually settling on a park, where he clumsily hid her in some bushes, Taiwanese police say. Before he disposed of her belongings, authorities say Chan took Poon's iPhone, her digital camera and an HSBC ATM card. Prosecutors say he immediately withdrew the equivalent of about US$700, with plans to go on a shopping spree, but changed his mind and caught his flight back to Hong Kong. There he further withdrew the equivalent of about $2,400 from Poon's account, and deposited it to his credit card, according to authorities. While authorities say Chan was enjoying Poon's money, her parents were growing increasingly frantic. Poon hadn't told them she was traveling with a boyfriend, but her mother found a copy of Chan's Taiwan Entry and Exit Permit at Poon's apartment, the court heard in April. On March 5, she filed a missing person report to police in Taiwan, and just over a week later they discovered Poon's now decomposing corpse in the Zhuwei park. Chan was brought in for questioning by Hong Kong police, and he admitted to murdering Poon and hiding her body, prosecutors say. Extradition woes Chan had admitted to the crime, and he'd been caught spending Poon's money, according to authorities. But police could not prove that he had planned the alleged murder in Hong Kong, meaning authorities in the city had no jurisdiction over it. Taiwanese prosecutors issued a warrant but without an extradition treaty, there was little chance of Chan being sent to Taiwan. Hong Kong officials have described the lack of an extradition agreement with mainland China as a loophole, but a British official who worked on the agreement to hand over the city to Chinese control in 1997 said the building of a firewall with China's legal system was deliberate. ""The UK made a conscious decision to create a clear divide between the two systems so that the rule of law remains robust,"" former British foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind wrote in June. ""The question of having a comprehensive arrangement for rendition, sending fugitives to mainland China, has been under discussion for more than 20 years, and of course got nowhere,"" former Hong Kong lawmaker Emily Lau told CNN. ""And the reason, the main reason, is that Hong Kong and mainland China have two very different legal systems, and we cannot guarantee, and nobody can guarantee, that anyone sent to mainland China, would get a fair trial, because what they have there."" According to Washinton-based watchdog Freedom House, China lacks an independent judiciary and fails to protect the right to due process. The conviction rate in China has been widely estimated to be around 98%. Demonstrations began over the extradition bill in April, and hundreds of thousands of people turned out to protest it on June 9. When the Hong Kong government pressed ahead, tens of thousands of protesters successfully blocked the city's legislature from holding a second reading, and in June, Lam agreed to suspend it, but not fully withdraw it. By the time she did announce its withdrawal, in September, it was too late: the protest demands had sprawled and the unrest -- by then in its fourth month -- showed no sign of stopping. As far as the Hong Kong legal system is concerned, now that he's left prison, Chan is a free man. Last week -- after lobbying by lawmakers and religious figures -- Chan told the Hong Kong government he would hand himself over to Taiwanese authorities, willing to face justice on the island. This apparent solution was thrown into doubt, however, when Taipei raised concerns about accepting his surrender without full judicial cooperation from Hong Kong, including handing over evidence against Chan. ""The homicide case took place in Taiwan. The body of the deceased, key witnesses, exhibits and relevant evidence were all in Taiwan. Without doubt, Taiwan has jurisdiction over this offence,"" Hong Kong's government said Wednesday. ""Now that Chan is willing to surrender, Taiwan should receive him, and initiate interrogation, evidence gathering and prosecution on him. Regarding the relevant evidence in Hong Kong, apart from those voluntarily brought with Chan, for other evidence, Hong Kong will, under the legal framework and following the procedures, provide all necessary assistance."" Poon's parents have called again and again for justice to be done, but there's not really anything more they can do. Lam has said over and over that the extradition bill is dead. Whether there is another way to send Chan to face justice for his alleged crime remains to be seen. "	CNN

Some articles even allege that demonstrations in Europe and South America are the direct result of Western tolerance of Hong Kong unrest, now in its 20th week. Speaking to reporters on Monday night, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that the response by Western countries to the protests showed ""democracy and human rights are only a pretentious cover for Western interference in Hong Kong affairs."" ""More and more people have come to realize that 'human rights', 'democracy' and 'beautiful sights' preached by some Western politicians are just illusory as a mirage in the desert,"" she said. In a commentary published in the state-run Beijing News on Sunday, former Chinese diplomat Wang Zhen wrote ""the disastrous impact of a 'chaotic Hong Kong' has begun to influence the Western world."" Over the past week, protesters have clashed with authorities in all three locations for different reasons, but Chinese state media alleged that demonstrators in Chile and Spain were taking their cues from Hong Kong. Hong Kong's protests have become increasingly destructive in the past month, with widespread vandalism and trashing of stores seen as pro-Beijing during demonstrations. On Sunday a march in the popular shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui quickly deteriorated into violence as petrol bombs were thrown and fires were lit in subway stations and outside shops. According to Wang, protesters in Spain had begun to adopt Hong Kong tactics, including the ""Be Water"" slogan to avoid police. Protesters have been gathering on the streets of Barcelona to call for Catalonia independence after pro-independence politicians were imprisoned with lengthy sentences. More than 200 police officers have been injured and 171 vehicles damaged since the protests began last week. In Chile, the military issued a curfew for the capital city of Santiago after prolonged demonstrations against a hike in public transport costs. Three people were killed in a supermarket fire in the city on Sunday. The same day, an editorial in state-run tabloid Global Times accused Hong Kong demonstrators of ""exporting revolution to the world."" ""The West is paying the price for supporting riots in Hong Kong, which has quickly kindled violence in other parts of the world and foreboded the political risks that the West can't manage,"" the editorial said. The United States has repeatedly voiced support for the Hong Kong protesters, to the fury of the Chinese government. On October 14, the US House of Representatives passed legislation in support of the Hong Kong activists which could see major financial penalties imposed on the major Chinese financial hub if Beijing cracks down on the city. In a video editorial posted to the Global Times official Twitter on October 17, editor Hu Xijin suggested protests could spread throughout the West. ""There are many problems in the West and all kinds of undercurrents of dissatisfaction. Many of them will eventually manifest in the way the Hong Kong protests did,"" he said. ""Catalonia is probably just the beginning."" There has been a series of bloody attacks on pro-protester and pro-Beijing supporters in Hong Kong this month. On October 12, a police officer was slashed in the neck while walking through a subway station, leading to two arrests. He was taken to hospital in a stable condition. Three days later, Jimmy Sham, a prominent protest march organizer, was attacked by a group of men wielding hammers and knives. He was left with wounds to the back of his skull and forehead. There has been no sign of an end to the ongoing demonstrations, which started June to protest against a controversial China extradition treaty, but have since broadened to include calls for democracy. In a commentary published in People's Daily, the official Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, Fudan University academic Shen Yi accused the West of ""double standards"" in its responses to protests in other countries. ""We still remember that certain people in the West called the large demonstrations in Hong Kong 'a beautiful sight to behold',"" Shen wrote, before asking if those same commentators would support Catalan protests. ""If they don't, they are applying double standards to the Hong Kong and Catalonia problems."" In a separate opinion piece published in People's Daily on Friday, Wang, the former diplomat, asked why Hong Kong's protesters were described as ""warriors for freedom and democracy,"" while in Spain the Catalan demonstrators were ""separatists."""

The French fashion house issued an apology Thursday over a map of China used during a presentation that didn't include Taiwan. The small island is a self-ruled democracy that Beijing insists be treated as part of its ""one China"" initiative. The message posted on Dior's verified Weibo account said it was an employee's fault, and that it supports China's ""sovereignty and territorial integrity."" It also wrote that it will investigate the incident, which happened Wednesday at a university in China. China is one of the world's biggest markets for luxury goods, and Chinese shoppers at home and abroad make up almost a third of purchases globally, according to McKinsey. Shoppers in Asia (excluding Japan) account for nearly a third of Dior's revenue in 2018 — the most of any region. Dior is owned by luxury conglomerate LVMH (LVMHF), which also operates Louis Vuitton and Hennessy. The company didn't immediately reply to CNN Business' request for comment. Dior is the latest Western company to make concessions in order to do business in China's coveted consumer market, particularly on the issue of Taiwan. Three US-based airlines caved to Chinese demands to change drop-down menus and maps to read ""Taiwan, China"" rather than simply ""Taiwan."" Gap (GPS) last year apologized for a T-shirt with a map of China that did not include Taiwan. Zara also came under fire over similar issues on its website in China and apologized. A more prominent flashpoint between Western companies and China are the pro-democracy protests occurring in Hong Kong over the past several months. The NBA faced fierce backlash sparked by Houston Rockets executive Daryl Morey after he tweeted support for the protests. That tweet caused all of the NBA's official Chinese partners to suspend business ties with the league. Some companies have started to restore partnerships with the NBA. Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG) also apologized for apps in their respective stores tied to the Hong Kong protests. "	CNN
39	https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/16/tech/blizzard-hong-kong-american-students-ban/index.html	Updated 6:43 PM ET, Wed October 16, 2019	"Blizzard bans a college esports team for holding a ""Free Hong Kong, Boycott Blizz"" sign"	"New York (CNN Business)Video game company Activision Blizzard suspended three American University esports players for six months after they held up a ""Free Hong Kong, boycott Blizz"" sign during their championship match last week. They now cannot compete in official or third-party Blizzard events. The three students were acting in solidarity with a Hong Kong player, Ng ""blitzchung"" Wai Chung, who was banned for six months by Blizzard and disqualified from the ""Hearthstone"" Grandmasters tournament last week after he shouted a pro-Hong Kong slogan. The company was met with outrage from gamers and calls for boycotts. The college sophomores, Casey Chambers, Corwin Dark and Torin Wright--all 19 years old and majoring in international studies--prepared a sign in reaction to Ng's ban and showed it on a stream of their college game October 8. The ban occurred Tuesday, one week later, according to Chambers. Blizzard confirmed to CNN Business Wednesday that it banned the three students after they ""knowingly broke"" the rules. In a statement, the company said: ""We strongly encourage everyone in our community to share their viewpoints in the many places available to express themselves. However, our official broadcast needs to be about the game and the competition, and to be a place where all are welcome."" At first, it didn't immediately appear Blizzard would ban the three students. On October 10, the three players were assigned to compete in their next match, but they forfeited because they felt ""it was hypocritical for Blizzard to punish Blitzchung's pro-human rights statement but not our clearly anti-Blizzard protest,"" Chambers told CNN Business. Blizzard did not comment on why it took more time to ban the students than it did to ban the Hong Kong player. Chambers said he and his friends had been supportive of the Hong Kong protests in the past: ""We just happened to have an amazing opportunity to protest an American company bowing down to China, within the context of the Hong Kong protests."" He said that while his team wasn't looking to get banned, ""it's good to see equal treatment"" between US esports players and those in Hong Kong. Blizzard said in a statement last Friday that its decision to ban Ng was not influenced by China. ""The trouble is that by responding in this manner, Blizzard is practically inviting other streamers to do the same,"" said Joost van Dreunen, co-founder of SuperData, a Nielsen company that analyzes the video game industry. ""Long term, however, Blizzard should do some soul searching."" "	CNN

A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. Netflix (NFLX) reports third quarter earnings after US markets close. The stakes couldn't be higher. ""We see a make or break quarter for Netflix,"" analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a recent note. Some analysts are worried that Netflix will miss its subscriber estimates once again, driving the stock even lower. Others believe that such concerns are already baked into the share price. Not everyone's a skeptic. In a recent research note, JPMorgan analysts conceded that Netflix faces a ""different operating environment ... going forward, one in which the streaming landscape becomes more populated by large, well-funded players, some of whom are more closely controlling their content distribution."" But the bank believes Netflix will continue to benefit from cord-cutting, a trend with staying power. ""We continue to believe Netflix has significant advantages around data — helping to inform which content to create and how much to pay — and also its breadth and depth of content,"" its analysts said. Hong Kong protests get tied to trade talks Are geopolitics driving the market? As the US-China trade fight expands in scope, it's getting easier to make that argument. Investors showed a burst of optimism on Tuesday as a batch of solid corporate earnings sent the S&P 500 rallying 1%. Positive sentiment was poised to extend into trading in Asia. But another sign of tensions between Washington and Beijing quickly tamped down the exuberance. What happened: China's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday warned of ""strong countermeasures"" if the United States enacts legislation passed by the House of Representatives that indicates support of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests. The legislation is backed by both Republicans and Democrats. ""We urge the US side to come to a clear assessment of the situation, immediately stop pushing the Hong Kong-related act and stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs before falling off the edge of the cliff,"" spokesperson Geng Shuang said in a statement. The result: Markets ""stopped in their tracks,"" Deutsche Bank observed. The concern among investors is that disagreement over protests in Hong Kong could derail the tenuous trade truce struck by the United States and China last week. ""Whatever countermeasures [China] may be planning in the event that the bill is ratified, it surely won't help the longevity of the limited trade truce between the two nations,"" said Rabobank analyst Bas van Geffen. Remember: The US called off higher tariffs on Chinese goods that would have gone into effect this week as President Donald Trump touted ""phase one"" of a deal. But both sides have yet to release any kind of agreement in writing and are still hammering out the details ahead of next month's APEC summit in Chile. My thought bubble: The confrontation between Washington and Beijing, which initially centered on alleged intellectual property theft, has metastasized over the past 18 months, roping in US security concerns about telecom equipment giant Huawei and Chinese purchases of US agricultural goods. In this environment, it seemed inevitable that the US response to events in Hong Kong would enter the picture. JPMorgan solidifies its Wall Street dominance Big US bank earnings painted a stark picture on Tuesday: JPMorgan (JPM) is flying high while competitors such as Goldman Sachs (GS) stumble. Take investment banking. JPMorgan's investment banking revenue jumped 8% in the third quarter on the strength of higher debt and equity underwriting fees, highlighting the bank's breadth despite fallout from the botched WeWork IPO. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, reported that investment banking revenue fell 15% compared to the same quarter last year. Goldman said that its pipeline of deals looks stronger. But analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods suspect that's because a number of deals weren't completed this quarter — not because business is really picking up. Up next More earnings. Bank of America (BAC) and PNC (PNC) report results before US markets open. IBM (IBM) and Netflix (NFLX) will follow after the close. Also today: US retail sales for September arrive at 8:30 a.m. ET.

41	https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/16/asia/hong-kong-protests-explosives-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 3:55 AM ET, Wed October 16, 2019	Hong Kong leader's policy address abandoned as lawmakers say she has 'blood on her hands' over protests	"Hong Kong (CNN)Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam's annual policy address ended in chaos Wednesday as pro-democracy lawmakers repeatedly disrupted her speech and heckled her with calls to honor the demands of months-long anti-government protests. The address had been seen as a key opportunity for Lam to begin to remedy some of the perceived factors behind the unrest, such as widespread inequality and limited access to public housing. But Lam was quickly forced to abandon her speech after repeated jeers and interruptions from lawmakers. Civic Party lawmaker Tanya Chan accused Lam of having ""blood on her hands"" and said she had no right to address lawmakers due to the chaos unleashed by Lam's now-shelved extradition bill with China. ""Since the extradition bill was announced, Hong Kong has been on the road of no return,"" Chan said. She has incited many people to come out to the protests. Why is she coming here to talk about the policy address and govern Hong Kong?"" In a speech later delivered by television, Lam said that ""people are asking: will Hong Kong return to normal? Is Hong Kong still a place we can live in peace?"" She condemned the violence and said the government would continue to work to stop it -- both through policy action and attempting to address the underlying causes -- but added that ""any acts that advocate Hong Kong's independence and threaten the country's sovereignty, security and development interests will not be tolerated.""  Protests which began over the bill have now lasted more than four months, with the movement's demands expanding to include other issues such as an independent investigation into police brutality and democratic reforms. While protests began peacefully, with hundreds of thousands turning out for anti-extradition bill marches, they have grown increasingly violent. Protesters regularly throw petrol bombs and bricks, and have begun vandalizing subway stations and China-linked businesses, as police respond with tear gas and water cannon. On Wednesday, police arrested two people on suspicion of making explosives, days after a bomb was set off near a police car following another night of violent protests. A 23-year-old man and a 17-year-old boy were arrested following late night raids on two flats in Hung Hom, in southern Kowloon. They were charged with ""making or possession of explosives,"" unlawful assembly, and possession of an offensive weapon. Anyone found guilty of possessing explosives deemed likely to ""endanger life or to cause serious injury to property"" can face up to 20 years in prison. Police said bomb-making materials, including devices that could be used to remotely activate an explosive, and other weapons were seized in the raids, carried out on ""intelligence received"" following an apparent attempted bombing of a police car on Sunday. Suryanto Chin Chiu, superintendent of the Hong Kong Police Explosive Ordnance Disposal Bureau, said that the device, which was hidden a short distance from a police car and controlled by a mobile phone, appeared to be homemade but required a significant amount of time and expertise to put together. No one was reported injured in the blast, which took place on Nathan Road, one of the city's busiest streets. Speaking Tuesday, Alick McWhirter, senior superintendent of the Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit, said that Sunday's alleged bombing was a ""calculated and premeditated attack on the police."" ""The blast was felt by officers 10-15 meters (32-49 foot) away -- this was not a casual act,"" he said. ""The attack required planning and the attack place was chosen. They waited until officers exited their vehicles (to set off the bomb)."" International pressure The city's government has struggled to cope with the growing chaos, largely depending on police to reign in the violence. Chief Executive Lam has repeatedly condemned the violence as she remained insistent that protesters' demands could not be considered while the unrest continues. Earlier this month, she used colonial-era emergency powers to ban citizens from wearing masks at public gatherings, but this led to a major uptick in violence, and widespread international criticism. That criticism reached new heights this week as members of the US House of Representatives voted to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which if it receives Senate and Presidential approval would mandate an annual review to determine whether Hong Kong's autonomy from mainland China remains sufficient to justify the special treatment the financial hub receives under US law. The bill's initial passage comes after several US lawmakers visited Hong Kong, and prominent pro-democracy politicians and activists in the city, including Joshua Wong, lobbied for lawmakers to approve it. In a statement Wednesday, China expressed its ""strong indignation and firm opposition"" to the bill, accusing Washington of interfering in ""China's internal affairs."" ""The current situation in Hong Kong has nothing to do with human rights or democracy,"" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. ""The real issue is to promptly end violence, restore order and safeguard the rule of law."" Geng added that the bill ""fully exposes the shocking hypocrisy of some in the US on human rights and democracy and their malicious intention to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability to contain China's development."" ""The US has important interests in Hong Kong,"" he said. ""If the relevant act were to become law, it would not only harm China's interests and China-US relations, but would also seriously damage US interests."" It is unclear whether the Hong Kong bill will ever become law. The Senate version of the legislation is still awaiting a floor vote and differs from the House version, meaning additional debates will likely be required. Any combined bill will then have to go to US President Donald Trump for his signature. While Trump has remained largely silent on the Hong Kong protests amid trade talks with the Chinese government, he has previously expressed a willingness to make deals on supposedly separate issues, and recent progress on the trade war front could be damaged by his government taking such a combative stance on Hong Kong.

Lawmakers approved the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act after demonstrators in the city of 7 million took to the streets earlier this week to urge the US Congress to approve the measure. The bill, which was seen as an uncontroversial measure because of its broad bipartisan support, passed by voice vote because a recorded vote was not requested. ""Democrats and Republicans in the House and in the Senate stand united with the people of Hong Kong,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. ""If America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interest, then we lose all moral authority to speak out for human rights anyplace in the world."" ""Today the House is proud to pass the bicameral, bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to reaffirm America's commitment to democracy,"" said the California Democrat. The bill would mandate an annual review to determine whether Hong Kong's autonomy from the mainland Chinese government remains sufficient to justify the special treatment the financial hub receives under US law. It would also lay out a process for the President to impose sanctions and travel restrictions on those who are found to be knowingly responsible for threatened or carried out arbitrary detention, torture, forced confession of any individual in Hong Kong, contraventions of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and Hong Kong's autonomy, or other violations of internationally recognized human rights in Hong Kong. The Senate version of the legislation is still awaiting a floor vote. The Senate bill differs slightly from the House measure -- a Senate aide involved in the process said the chamber is likely to pass its own version, meaning the House may have to take up the issue again later on, after the Senate holds its vote. House members on Tuesday afternoon also passed by voice vote two other Hong Kong-related measures: a resolution supportive of the protesters and the PROTECT Hong Kong Act. The latter would halt US exports of nonlethal crowd control equipment, such as rubber bullets and tear gas, to the Hong Kong police until an independent investigation into human rights concerns is completed, those concerns are adequately addressed by the Hong Kong government and the White House determines that Hong Kong law enforcement has not engaged in human rights violations for a year. Even as President Donald Trump has remained largely silent on the Hong Kong protests amid trade talks with the Chinese government, members of Congress from both parties -- widely in agreement on the question of the Chinese Communist Party's human rights abuses and oppression of its citizens -- have sided with the protesters. RELATED: Trump promised Xi US silence on Hong Kong democracy protests as trade talks stalled The protests have gripped Hong Kong for months. They began in early June, when more than a million people marched against a bill that would have allowed individuals in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China for trial. The city's unelected leader, Carrie Lam, has since scrapped the bill. But the movement has remained strong, in an effort to secure democratic reforms in Hong Kong, as well as an independent inquiry into allegations of police misconduct. Interactions between protesters and police have become more violent in recent weeks — at the beginning of October, a police officer shot an 18-year-old protester in the chest with a live round during an exceptionally chaotic day. Arrests have also ramped up. Last week, Hong Kong Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung said that more than 2,300 people have been arrested during the protests, 750 of whom are under 18. "	CNN
44	https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/14/us/lebron-james-nba-china-intl-hnk-scli/index.html	Updated 4:20 PM ET, Tue October 15, 2019	LeBron James says NBA exec was 'misinformed' in his tweet supporting Hong Kong protests	"(CNN)LeBron James has long spoken out on social justice issues, such as in his advocacy for the Black Lives Matter movement, his criticism of President Trump as a ""bum"" and his push to be ""more than an athlete."" But on Monday night, the vocal NBA star sided with silence as he criticized Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey as ""misinformed"" over Morey's tweet supporting Hong Kong protesters. ""I just think that when you're misinformed or you're not educated about something -- and I'm just talking about the tweet itself -- you never know the ramifications that can happen. We all see what that did -- not only for our league but for all of us in America, for people in China as well,"" he told reporters on Monday. James' comments threatened to undermine his reputation as perhaps the foremost social justice advocate in popular culture. Amid that criticism from sports columnists and politicians, James tried to clarify his position on Twitter. He said he was ""not discussing the substance"" of the tweet and added that Morey ""could have waited a week"" to tweet what he did. James' criticism came while the NBA is embroiled in a standoff with China after Morey tweeted his support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. Morey quickly apologized and deleted his original tweet, but the league's Chinese partners suspended ties, state broadcaster CCTV halted all broadcasts of preseason matches, and the Chinese government said the NBA needed to show ""mutual respect."" The rift, and the NBA's rapid attempts to salvage its massive Chinese market, have sparked broader questions about the influence of China on free speech in corporate America. Speaking to reporters before a game in Los Angeles Monday, James called it ""a very delicate situation, a very sensitive situation."" When asked whether Morey should be reprimanded for his tweet, James responded, ""I think when we all sit back and learn from the situation that happened, understand that what you could tweet or could say, and we all talk about this freedom of speech -- yes, we do all have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others and you're only thinking about yourself."" ""I don't want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand and he spoke. So many people could have been harmed, not just financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say and what we do, even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too."" James, who plays for the Los Angeles Lakers, added that he and his teammates had stayed silent about the situation because they were ""not informed enough"" about it, and that ""I'm not here to judge how the League handles the situation."" Hong Kong and China's fraught relationship Hong Kong has been gripped by more than four months of increasingly violent pro-democracy demonstrations, with hostility and anti-China sentiment ramping up among the protesters. Hong Kong is part of China -- but as a former British colony, it's also a semi-autonomous city with its own language, currency, legal system, and freedoms of speech, press, and assembly. The protest movement has been driven by persistent fears that those freedoms are now being slowly eroded, as China encroaches on the city's autonomy. In recent weeks demonstrators have burned Chinese flags, spray painted ""Hong Kong is not China"" across the city, and even attacked Chinese owned-businesses. Beijing has taken a hard stance in response -- just this weekend, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned that any attempt to split China will ""end in crushed bodies and shattered bones"" according to state-media. aMany companies and brands have become caught in the crossfire. Those who sympathize with the protesters face Chinese fury and financial backlash; those who try to placate China draw accusations of cowardice from protest supporters in the United States and elsewhere. The NBA faced both of these last week as it tried to navigate the controversy. In a tweet later Monday night, James clarified that he meant Morey wasn't educated on the repercussions of the Hong Kong tweet, rather than the situation on the ground. ""I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet,"" he wrote. ""I'm not discussing the substance. Others can talk about that."" He added that it had been ""a difficult week"" for the Lakers and the NBA. ""I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it."" How one tweet became the NBA's worst nightmare The NBA spat spiraled rapidly since Morey's original October 4 tweet of an image that read, ""Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong."" The tweet set off a firestorm in China almost immediately, with the NBA saying days later that it recognized that Morey's views ""have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable."" The league has spent years and many millions of dollars investing in China, helping to build courts, giving broadcasting rights away for free and bringing its stars over for preseason games. China makes up at least 10% of the league's current revenue, according to one analyst, and the country is expected to contribute even more than that over the next decade, perhaps reaching 20% of the league's revenue by 2030. But the NBA's response drew widespread and scathing bipartism criticism in the United States, and the NBA issued a stronger-worded statement emphasizing freedom of expression in an attempt at damage control. The next day, all 11 of the NBA's official Chinese partners suspended ties. ""It's already been answered,"" the media officer said. ""This is a question that's not been answered. James?"" Macfarlane responded, to which Harden stayed silent. Correction: This story has been updated to properly reflect the NBA's response to Morey's tweet. Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report."	CNN
45	https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/12/asia/xi-jinping-balancing-act-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 8:28 PM ET, Sat October 12, 2019	China President Xi Jinping's balancing act over Hong Kong	"Hong Kong (CNN)Hong Kong's summer of discontent has spilled over into fall, bringing with it tear gas, petrol bombs and widespread transport disruptions -- all the elements that have divided the city during four months of unrest. Observers had looked to China's National Day on October 1 as a potential turning point for the protests, and since then they've escalated with protesters targeting businesses linked to mainland China. The vandalism and violence poses a direct challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is not known for his tolerance of views that differ from the ruling Communist Party. However, it is not clear if Beijing has a red line, and what it would take for protesters to cross it before provoking a Chinese military response. Chinese military intervention in Hong Kong is still believed to be the last resort, as it would carry disastrous consequences for both the territory and mainland China. But experts say the Hong Kong government's failed efforts to stop the protests by evoking emergency powers could move Hong Kong closer to a more aggressive response from Beijing. Balancing act Xi, who effectively made himself ""president for life"" by dropping presidential term limits in 2018, is China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. He is set to convene a high-level Communist Party meeting later this month and will want to protect his image of a tough nationalist leader that's driving China to a more prosperous future. ""He faces potentially embarrassing questions over Hong Kong as the situation is not under control after four months,"" said Willie Lam, adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""He cannot be appear to be weak, otherwise he will lose face."" For a few months, China embarked on a propaganda campaign and social media blitz to demonize the Hong Kong protesters. Now, all mention of the protests are blocked once again as a topic on social media in the mainland. Chinese state media continuously reinforces its message that they are dangerous, out-of-control separatists influenced by foreign forces, and that the Chinese military or armed police could be sent in at a moment's notice to crush them. In reality, such a response could destabilize Hong Kong and China's economy, destroy Xi's global reputation and disrupt long-term plans for political and social assimilation of Hong Kong with the mainland. ""You can send in the troops but unless you suppress the protesters with overwhelming force then you're just going to require continued occupation,"" said Adam Ni, a China researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney. Experts say armed intervention in Hong Kong would also provide political leverage for Xi's factional opponents. ""There are political forces within the Chinese Communist Party that would like to see him slip up as a way to justify removing him as president for life,"" said Malcolm Davis, senior analyst in Defense Strategy and Capability at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Xi will also be thinking of cross-strait relations with Taiwan, which have only worsened since the Hong Kong protests began in June. While Taiwan has been self-ruled since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, Beijing has not given up its desire for reunification through political negotiations. ""There's no way that they are going to sign up to any peaceful negotiation with the Chinese, given what's happening in Hong Kong. So ultimately, Xi may be forced into a bigger risk with Taiwan as a result of what's happening,"" said Davis. Economy Analysts say if People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops or the paramilitary People's Armed Police cracked down in Hong Kong, the stock market and housing market would crash and a mass exodus would likely follow. Hong Kong is an important global financial and business center, with foreign companies and investors seeing the city as a stable gateway to Asia. Already, the protests are having an impact on Hong Kong's economy, but Chinese boots on the ground would seriously damage its image as a safe and open place to do business. Such instability caused by an armed intervention could prompt corporations to reconsider their investment in the city. ""It's possible that multinational companies, or companies listed on the Hong Kong stock market may think of moving to Singapore or another financial center in Asia Pacific,"" Lam said. Chinese companies use the Hong Kong stock market to raise capital and many powerful Chinese elites who have invested heavily in Hong Kong would stand to lose huge amounts of money in the event of an economic collapse, Lam added. About half of all the foreign direct investment into China last year came through Hong Kong. And a similar percentage of investment from China flowed into Hong Kong, according to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. The figures are in the hundreds of billions of dollars. China is also fighting a bitter trade war with the US, dealing with a slowing economy, and the strains of building the Belt and Road Initiative -- Xi's signature global infrastructure policy that aims to build new trade routes linking China to Asia, Africa and Europe. ""Hong Kong is still the major place where the Chinese economy raises cash to finance its modernization programs,"" Lam said. ""They want to raise more money and they need Hong Kong actually more than ever."" A bloody crackdown akin to the 1989 Tiananmen massacre would also damage China's image in the eyes of many in the region. Xi is risking sanctions and important diplomatic and economic relations being severed. ""Armed intervention in Hong Kong just adds to the narrative of a threatening China,"" Ni said. Playing into Beijing's hand, however, is the power it holds over multinational companies afraid of losing lucrative business on the mainland. And Beijing has been quick to take punitive measures against companies that show support for the protests. Hong Kong's flagship aircraft carrier Cathay Pacific has borne the brunt of Chinese pressure, which has even extended to US entities like the NBA and video game company Blizzard Entertainment who have become embroiled in disputes over Hong Kong. 'Can't go on forever' The protests, now entering their 19th weekend, have become increasingly violent and destructive, particularly following Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam's use of emergency powers on October 5 to ban face masks at public gatherings. Police have also ramped up their response -- two protesters were shot with live ammunition on two separate occasions since October 1, marking a turning point in the four month-long civil unrest. ""They (Beijing) can't let this go on indefinitely. They can't let it continue to intensify,"" said Davis. ""I think that we are in the stage now, where things are going to slide towards some sort of military or People's Armed Police intervention. And that could be a devastating situation for the protesters."" But no one knows where that line is. Analysts say it's still a question that Beijing is actively considering. ""It's smart not to state a clear red line because you are going to have to act on it to keep your credibility once that line has been breached. And there is every likelihood that protesters would actively seek to breach that line,"" Ni said. That line could also be crossed if Beijing loses confidence in the Hong Kong government's ability to win the struggle, Ni added. The Hong Kong government can request assistance from the Hong Kong PLA garrison ""in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief."" Though analysts say China's paramilitary police -- the PAP -- who would be more likely to be deployed in Hong Kong as they are specifically trained to put down social unrest on the mainland. At a press conference Tuesday, Chief Executive Lam said she believes the Hong Kong government ""should find the solutions ourselves,"" but that her government could still call on Beijing for assistance. ""No options should be ruled out,"" she said. Using emergency powers is one way Xi and Lam can attempt to keep a firm hand on the situation, without resorting to boots on the ground. While invoking the Emergency Ordinance Regulation to pass an anti-mask ban did nothing to quell the protests, it does allow police to make more arrests, said Lam, the Hong Kong politics expert. ""Overall, the order from Beijing is the Hong Kong government should apply the rules more stringently and make more arrests. And, if a sizable number of ringleaders are arrested then it will help the Lam administration to restore order sooner,"" he said. Since the protests began, 2,363 people between the ages of 12 and 83 have been arrested, and 77 since the mask law came into effect, according to Hong Kong police. Lam added that more draconian measures could be enacted under emergency powers, if protests continue to intensify. But there is little sign protesters will stop any time soon and the mask ban has only added fuel to the fire. As far back as August, some radical protesters said they welcomed a crackdown and were ""ready for it,"" no matter the costs to the city and potentially the movement itself. ""The fundamental contradiction here at the heart of this unfolding crisis is that, on the one hand you have Hong Kongers wanting to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy as promised when the territory was handed over to China by the UK. And on the other is Beijing's desire to tighten Hong Kong's institutions, reduce its autonomy and integrate it into PRC's political systems,"" Ni said. Lam, the Hong Kong politics expert, said Xi will be hoping that public opinion will soon swing away from the protesters and the more hardcore elements of the movement, if the violence and vandalism further disrupt daily life. But if the waiting game doesn't pan out, Xi may be forced to put the future strength and stability of the party ahead of potentially severe economic consequences. ""I don't see this ending peacefully, I don't see both sides, stepping back from the brink,"" China analyst Davis said. "	CNN
46	https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/12/tech/blizzard-hong-kong-response-blitzchung/index.html	Updated 1:08 PM ET, Sat October 12, 2019	Blizzard said it will return prize money to Hong Kong esports player	"New York (CNN)Video game company Blizzard Entertainment walked back some penalties on an esports player who aired support for the Hong Kong protests after gamers around the world called for a boycott of the company. Blizzard explained Friday that it disqualified Hearthstone player Ng ""Blitzchung"" Wai Chung for shouting the protest slogan ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"" because it was a violation of rules that he had acknowledged. Anything that brings a player into ""public disrepute,"" offends the public, or damages Blizzard's image would lead to a ban and loss of prize money, according to the competition rules. The company said that it will reduce Ng's suspension to six months from a year, and return lost prize money. Ng told CNN Business it is about $10,000 in winnings. ""We've had a chance to pause, to listen to our community, and to reflect on what we could have done better. In hindsight, our process wasn't adequate, and we reacted too quickly,"" J. Allen Brack, president of Blizzard Entertainment, wrote in a statement published Friday. The lengthy statement from Activision Blizzard (ATVI), the maker of games including Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, walked back the full-year suspension while explaining why it believes a penalty was justified.""There is a consequence for taking the conversation away from the purpose of the event and disrupting or derailing the broadcast,"" Brack said. Ng responded to Blizzard's decision in a Twitch livestream Saturday morning. ""I'm grateful to Blizzard for reconsidering my ban,"" he said. ""I think half a year [ban] is still pretty long. It's still quite a loss to me, as an esports player."" He said that although he knew airing political views on a broadcast was against the rules, he did so anyway because he wanted to shine a light on the Hong Kong protests. The money is ""not important,"" he said on Twitch. ""If I really cared about money, I wouldn't have said anything on the stream during my interview."" Businesses have become ensnared in Hong Kong's pro-democracy, anti-government protests, which are now in their fourth month. Beijing has taken a hard line on some global companies and brands. It scrubbed television show South Park from the Chinese internet after an episode criticized censorship, and pulled NBA preseason games off the air after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of Hong Kong. Apple took down an app used used by Hong Kong protesters this week, saying it was being used to target police. ""Activision Blizzard's statement is totally inadequate given the circumstances,"" said Rod Breslau, an esports and gaming consultant, ""It took over five days for Activision Blizzard to finally give a response, much more than it took the NBA or Apple, and it can be argued they took the worst possible stance of the three."" Gamers have accused Blizzard of appeasing China's communist-led government. In response to the disqualification, some fans called for boycotts. Others drew fan art or made memes of a Chinese character within the Blizzard-owned video game ""Overwatch,"" recasting her as a Hong Kong protester in a bid to get that game banned in China. On Tuesday, a small group of employees walked out of its Irvine, California, headquarters in protest. Blizzard stated Friday that ""our relationships in China had no influence on our decision"" and that if a player had shouted a pro-Beijing slogan, they would also be dealt with the same way. Chinese ties Other American video game companies with Chinese business ties have spoken out this week on how they would treat political views on broadcasts. The CEO of Fortnite maker Epic Games, Tim Sweeney, tweeted this week that despite Chinese tech giant Tencent's roughly 40% stake in the company, he was still the controlling shareholder and would allow players to express political views. Riot Games, a video game company owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent, said Friday that it won't allow any political statements on its broadcasts. Political and religious ""topics are often incredibly nuanced, require deep understanding and a willingness to listen, and cannot be fairly represented in the forum our broadcast provides,"" John Needham, global head of Riot's ""League of Legends"" esports, tweeted Friday. ""Therefore, we have reminded our casters and pro players to refrain from discussing any of these topics on air."" Riot spokesman Joe Hixson clarified to CNN Business that meant ""political statements of any kind — Trump, Brexit, Hong Kong, etc. — won't be aired."" ""Activision, Riot, the guys who are there are playing by the Chinese rules,"" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at private financial services firm Wedbush, ""The guys who aren't there either won't play by the Chinese rules or the Chinese don't want them there because they don't trust them.""

Ted Cruz rips Beijing 'dictatorship' during Hong Kong visit	"Hong Kong (CNN)US Sen. Ted Cruz on Saturday condemned China's handling of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, saying suppression of free speech in the territory showed fear from what he called a ""dictatorship"" in Beijing. ""The Chinese Communist government, I believe, is terrified of the protesters in the streets in Hong Kong,"" the Texas Republican told reporters at an afternoon meeting at the US consul general's residence in the Chinese special administrative region. ""President Xi is terrified of millions of people in Hong Kong but even more than that millions of people in China yearning to live free."" The 2016 US presidential candidate was dressed head to toe in black, in what he called a sign of solidarity with Hong Kong protesters -- men and women, boys and girls, he said -- who have adopted that as their de facto uniform. ""A protester has power that makes the dictatorship tremble,"" Cruz said, comparing a man shot in the chest by a Hong Kong police officer last week to the protester who stared down a column of tanks in Tiananmen Square during the 1989 anti-government protests. Asked about the violent turn some of the Hong Kong protests have taken in recent weeks, Cruz said he had not seen violence on the part of the protesters, who have been vandalizing subway stations and businesses with ties to China and who have physically attacked some who have disagreed with them. Cruz said he had met protest leaders, whom he did not name, and was told that violence was being perpetrated by agents of Beijing who had infiltrated the protest movement. While he said he had no proof of that, he said it was something that Beijing would favor. ""There is a reason that the Communist Party in China wants the Hong Kong protests to turn violent,"" he said. ""The Chinese Communist Party very much wants to characterize these protests as violent acts of terrorism rather than democracy protesters standing up for human rights."" He called on protesters not to give Beijing that leverage and to resist the urge to engage in aggression and adopt the non-violent protest examples of Mahatma Gandhi in India and Martin Luther King Jr. in the US. Cruz, one of the highest-profile US politicians to visit the Hong Kong since the pro-democracy protests began 19 weekends ago, said Carrie Lam, the city's chief executive, canceled a meeting with him on his arrival in the territory on Saturday morning. The long-planned meeting was scrapped when he refused to keep any discussions with Lam secret, he said. ""She seems to misunderstand how free speech operates,"" Cruz said. The cancellation was a sign of weakness and fear from Lam, he said. The Texas senator said Beijing's reaction to a tweet by an NBA general manager this week showed similar fear of values like free speech. Daryl Morey, GM of the Houston Rockets, the NBA team in Cruz's hometown, posted an image on Twitter that read, ""Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong."" In response, ""the Communist government in China lost their minds,"" Cruz said. ""They treated it as a threat to the very heart of their dictatorship."" China responded with ""economic blackmail and extortion,"" severing long-standing business relationships with the basketball league and demanding apologies. He said Beijing was trying to impose ""global censorship"" to anybody who disagreed with its policies and principles. He called on the league to cease commercial relations with China. Getting back to Hong Kong in the 40-minute session with reporters, Cruz said protesters' demands for an investigation into police actions during the protests and, more importantly, universal suffrage and free elections, should be met. ""Those demands are right, they are reasonable and I stand with the people of Hong Kong calling on the government of China to honor the promises it made to the world when it promised to maintain political freedom in Hong Kong,"" he said. The city has become an example to the world of what freedom and free enterprise can accomplish, Cruz said, but it needs to restore democratic values to continue to be that beacon. ""The Chinese government, if it continues to respond with brutality and oppression, risks destroying the prosperity in Hong Kong,"" he said. Cruz said he would continue efforts in the US Congress to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, which would require reevaluation of certain rights the territory was granted separate from China. ""We should continue to look for tools to stand up for human rights and for democracy and to speak clearly against repression and torture and murder,"" Cruz said. He cited not only the Hong Kong legislation but other actions the US government has taken to sanction those involved with the detention of Muslim Uyghurs and other minority groups in China. "	CNN

In a memo to employees on Thursday, Cook said Apple removed HKmap.live from its App Store Thursday, because it had been used in ways that ""endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong."" The memo was anonymously posted on Pastebin, a website that allows people to post items without revealing their identities. The text was confirmed by a source with knowledge of the memo. Hong Kong has been rocked by several months of protests from anti-government demonstrators. Cook told employees in the memo that the decision to scrap the app wasn't easy, but Apple received ""credible information"" from Hong Kong officials and users of the app that HKmap.live was being ""used maliciously."" Some protestors were violently targeting people and property where police weren't present, Cook said, noting the App Store bans apps that can be used for personal harm. He also noted the app violated Hong Kong law. Apple ""thoroughly reviewed"" the situation before making the decision, Cook said. The app used various emoji to communicate what was happening across Hong Kong: A dog marked where police officers were present; a police car showed where police vehicles were located; and a camera marked the location of a livestream. John Gruber, a widely respected tech blogger and Apple observer, criticized the memo. He wrote on Twitter that Cook's letter was ""both sad and startling"" and dismantled the response on his website, questioning Cook's evidence for his claims. In a statement, Apple (AAPL) said Thursday the app had been used to target and ""ambush"" police and threaten public safety. ""Criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,"" Apple said in an emailed response to CNN Business. Apple declined to further comment. Google (GOOG) similarly pulled a role-playing game based on the Hong Kong protests from its app store on Thursday.

In the app, called ""The Revolution of Our Times,"" people could role-play as Hong Kong protesters. Users could make purchases while playing, buying things like protective gear and weapons as they move through different stages in the game, according to local media reports. The removal of the app was ""not in response to a government request but because the app violated the Play Store's policies,"" a Google spokesperson said. Protests have been taking place in Hong Kong for months and dozens of foreign companies that do business in mainland China and the semi-autonomous city have been caught up in the fallout. Earlier this week, Apple (AAPL) pulled a real-time mapping app called HKmap.live from its App Store. The app used various emojis to communicate what was happening across Hong Kong: A dog marked where police officers were present; a police car showed where police vehicles were located; and a camera marked the location of a livestream. Apple said it had received complaints about the app from several people in Hong Kong, saying it had been used in ways that ""endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong."" Apple's decision came soon after Chinese state media criticized it for allowing HKmap to be downloaded. The National Basketball Association was also drawn into the controversy around the Hong Kong protests last week. The American league is facing a ferocious backlash in China after Houston Rockets executive Daryl Morey tweeted support for the protests. That prompted all of the NBA's official Chinese partners to suspend business ties with the league.

51	https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/perspectives/china-nba-morey-tweet/index.html	Updated 10:01 AM ET, Thu October 10, 2019	The NBA is feeling China's wrath. Here's what other businesses can learn	"Phil Taylor is a contributing writer for The Athletic. He is a former Sports Illustrated senior writer and columnist. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. It is not exactly news that in order to tap into certain international markets, US businesses often choose to turn a blind eye to the policies of foreign governments that are not in line with American values. US companies tend to choose profits over ideals. The National Basketball Association was doing exactly that in China, where it has profited from the burgeoning Asian interest in professional basketball to the tune of $4 billion while ignoring the Communist government's human rights issues. But the dynamics of the NBA-China business partnership changed last Sunday, when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for Hong Kong protestors. ""Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,"" Morey tweeted, triggering backlash from the Chinese government. Within hours Morey's boss, Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta, responded: That didn't stop Tencent, which has a five-year streaming deal with the NBA in China worth $1.5 billion, from announcing that it would not air Rockets games until further notice. Chinese online stores pulled Rockets merchandise from their websites, and the Chinese Basketball Association, headed by national icon and former Rockets star Yao Ming, announced it was suspending cooperation with the team. Other American businesses with foreign interests are undoubtedly watching the NBA's difficulties with interest, realizing that doing business with an authoritative regime can be like walking through a minefield. Taking issue with the policies of such a government, even in a relatively innocuous way like Morey's tweet, can have severe financial repercussions. The Rockets' GM, after all, is hardly an internationally well-known figure, and his stance on the Hong Kong protests would not have done any real damage to the Chinese government. If China reacted so strongly to Morey's comment, imagine the wrath LeBron James or one of the NBA's other world-famous players would have received if they had expressed support for the protestors. The NBA isn't the first company to run afoul of China. Versace and Gap have also apologized in recent months over products that inadvertently questioned Chinese sovereignty. But other companies haven't fostered as much of a reputation for speaking out on social issues and standing up for human rights as the NBA has. This is a league that forced Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling to sell his team five years ago after several of his racist comments came to light. James and other NBA stars have spoken out about criminal injustice reform and the NFL's treatment of Colin Kaepernick. Coaches Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich have made their feelings known about US immigration policy and gun regulation. The league has been praised for its willingness to allow players and coaches to take political stances without fear of being silenced by NBA commissioner Adam Silver or team owners. It's that reputation that has made the China situation more complicated for the NBA. How does the league walk the fine line between not offending a major partner and allowing its employees the freedom to express themselves publicly? The answer so far has been -- awkwardly. After the Rockets distanced themselves from Morey's tweet, he deleted it and apologized. Silver released what amounted to an apology, but specified that the league would not discipline Morey. After media criticism alleged Silver was capitulating to China, he issued a statement on Tuesday that defended Morey more strongly. Other companies who do business in China may have to bend over backwards to avoid offending the Chinese, but they don't have to then twist themselves into a pretzel trying to reconcile that position with their public stance on freedom of expression and social justice. Tapping into the Chinese market requires a certain selling of the corporate soul, but other US businesses are surely grateful that their decision to do so isn't quite as glaring as the NBA's. "	CNN

The NBA has found itself in a conundrum similarly faced by airlines, hotel chains, retailers, tech companies and virtually any company that wants to do business in China: Toe the Communist party line on Hong Kong protests, Uyghur Muslims, Taiwan's independence claims and Tibet — or face threats of losing access to the market. Before these Hong Kong protests, the most visible flashpoint has been Taiwan. Airlines quickly caved to Chinese demands to change drop-down menus and maps to read ""Taiwan, China"" rather than simply ""Taiwan."" Taiwan is a self-ruled democracy that Beijing insists be treated as part of mainland China. China's aviation authority demands Hong Kong and Macau must also be clearly labeled as part of China. At the time, the US government called China's language police ""Orwellian nonsense."" The White House ""will stand up for Americans resisting efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to impose Chinese political correctness on American companies and citizens."" But the companies themselves rarely stand against the Chinese government: Gap (GPS) last year apologized for a T-shirt with a map of China that did not include Taiwan. Last year, a Marriott (MAR) employee was quickly fired, and Marriott apologized, for liking a social media post about Tibet. It goes beyond just swallowing your democratic principles to sell T-shirts or plane tickets. It's a major concern for China hawks who say the regime uses American technology at odds with American human rights standards — say, to track Hong Kong protestors or to monitor and detain Muslim minorities in the remote Northwest of the country. China claims it is combating terrorism. The Commerce Department sees otherwise and has added 28 Chinese companies to its list of banned exports, trying to keep American companies from helping China's police state.

The tweet has placed the basketball league at odds with China's communist government -- and now threatens to undermine its decades-long relationship with the country and its millions of fans. The firestorm began Friday when Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey sent a tweet containing the popular protest rallying call ""Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong."" The tweet, though swiftly deleted, resulted in a severe backlash inside China, where the Hong Kong protests have been framed in state media as a foreign-backed independence movement. The NBA and Commissioner Adam Silver were initially criticized in the US for not forcefully defending Morey's right to free speech. Silver and the league issued a more robust statement backing Morey and the right to individual expression Tuesday, only to draw the ire of Beijing, as well as major Chinese sponsors and commercial partners. Wednesday's press conferences had been widely publicized inside China, where many were eager to hear what Lakers forward LeBron James had to say about the furore. James is considered the NBA's biggest star and its global face. He is also one of its most outspoken advocates on social issues. James has previously used his celebrity to speak out on topics he's personally passionate about like childhood education and racial injustice. The Lakers and the Nets are in China to play two preseason games and participate in several events with fans and the community. A Nets community event Tuesday and NBA fan night Wednesday were also canceled. Those events was supposed to feature players from the Nets and Lakers as well as Chinese celebrities. The Shanghai Sports Federation said in a statement it canceled the fan night ""because of Houston Rockets General Manager Morey's inappropriate comments and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver's inappropriate remarks."" It's unclear if the games will still go ahead as planned. '30 years of hard work was destroyed in three days' The NBA was the first North American sports league to invest in China 30 years ago, and until Morey's tweet Friday the league had reaped the benefits in the form of lucrative broadcasting contracts and other deals. Today, there are more NBA fans in China than in the US. The market is estimated to make up at least 10% of league revenue, according to estimates. That partnership is now in jeopardy. A commentary published on the Weibo account of China's state-run CCTV, whose sports channel broadcasts NBA games, said ""30 years of hard work was destroyed in three days"" by Silver and the NBA. The piece also accused Silver of ""twisting the facts and confusing the public."" The fallout for the NBA has been swift. All of the NBA's official partners in China have now cut ties with the league, and the criticism from Chinese state media has become increasingly biting. ""So-called freedom of expression is never absolute. Any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability do not belong to the category of free speech. Silver and Morey's excuses have only shown their ulterior motives and arrogance,"" the CCTV commentary published Wednesday read. Fans in a bind James and the Lakers' trip to China was hotly anticipated even before the Morey controversy because it offered fans a glimpse into how the longtime NBA star will fit alongside new teammate Anthony Davis, one of the best big men in the league. The Lakers traded for Davis over the summer and are expected to contend for the championship. The Nets also added two All-Stars -- Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving -- to their exciting young core in the summer, though Durant is expected to sit out this season with an Achilles injury. CNN spoke to several fans outside the Ritz Carlton in Shanghai, where the teams are staying. While some were afraid to share there true feelings, several made it clear that country comes before fandom -- and they would stop watching basketball if Beijing severed ties with the NBA. ""Morey must apologize for his misunderstanding about our country,"" said 21-year-old college student Rudy Chen. ""If I cannot watch NBA, it's not a big deal."" "	CNN

A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, the United States and its allies hoped that Beijing would adopt an increasingly liberal approach to its economy and financial markets, more closely mirroring its trading partners in the West. Political liberalization, it was assumed, would inevitably follow. This week has exposed the faulty logic that underpinned those assumptions. A clash over free expression has ensnared the NBA, and the Trump administration has taken action against Beijing over alleged human rights violations. At stake is the relationship between the world's two largest economies — as well as a crucial round of trade negotiations. What's happening: The fight between China and the NBA has only become more fraught. All of the NBA's official Chinese partners have suspended ties with the league after the Houston Rockets general manager tweeted support for the Hong Kong protests last weekend. Meanwhile, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Tuesday that he won't censor players or team owners over China or other issues. He argued that the league is motivated by much more than money, and freedom of expression must be protected. The league doesn't have great options, my CNN Business colleague Chris Isidore writes: ""They can fire [Rockets general manager Daryl] Morey and apologize, which would be seen in America as putting profits ahead of free expression and caving to anti-democratic forces in China. Or they [can] stand behind him and risk losing the sport's largest growth market."" That tension has resurfaced questions about whether Western companies can operate in China while sticking to their values and keeping customers happy at home. It's an issue that's dogged US airlines, which have tweaked references to Taiwan to appease Beijing, and Google, which came under fire for developing a censored Chinese-language version of its search engine. My thought bubble: Improved market access for US companies has been a goal of trade talks. But what happens when doing business in China exposes companies to the kind of trouble rocking the NBA? Facebook, which has been shut out of the country, might be breathing a sigh of relief. It's a tense environment for trade talks The NBA battle is ostensibly separate from trade talks. But it doesn't help the already tense environment ahead of high-level discussions in Washington on Thursday. The scene: Earlier this week, the United States put 28 Chinese entities on a blacklist that effectively bars them from importing American technology over the groups' alleged role in facilitating human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region. Then, on Tuesday, the Trump administration announced visa restrictions on Chinese officials suspected of being involved such abuses. The spike in tensions sparked a late session selloff for US stocks on Tuesday. The S&P 500 finished down nearly 1.6%, while the Dow dropped 1.2%. The scare did not carry over to most Asian markets on Wednesday, however. The fear: ""Recent events surrounding US-China ties threaten to raise new points of conflict beyond just trade differences,"" said FXTM market analyst Han Tan. ""A wider scope in this protracted conflict would only heighten the barriers to a meaningful reconciliation between the world's two economic powerhouses."" Risk aversion should continue to be the name of the game. Watch safe haven assets, like gold and the Japanese yen. The Fed resumes Treasury purchases The Federal Reserve will start expanding its balance sheet again — but don't call it quantitative easing. From my CNN Business colleague Donna Borak in Washington: ""Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday said that policymakers will 'soon' announce measures that would add to the supply of reserves 'over time.' The policy move comes weeks after the central bank stepped into financial markets to keep very-short-term interest rates from rising."" What it means: It gets wonky, but the Fed is looking to increase levels of reserves to relieve stress in the overnight lending market. To do this, UBS expects the Fed to purchase at least $200 billion in T-bills, and that the Fed will finish these purchases by the end of the year. This should reduce some of the daily pressure on the New York Fed, which has been staging interventions. Powell has made clear that he does not view this as part of a program of monetary easing. But it's a further sign that something unusual is happening in a key part of the markets, and that the Fed felt it needed to come up with a more dramatic response.

56	https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/media/espn-daryl-morey-tweet-china/index.html	Updated 4:27 AM ET, Wed October 9, 2019	ESPN faces criticism over its coverage of Hong Kong tweet and the NBA	"New York (CNN Business)The NBA controversy in China this week over a tweet from a Houston Rockets executive has now affected America's leading sports network. ESPN's critics have accused the company of kowtowing to Beijing by not discussing the politics at the heart of the country's showdown with the NBA. But a source at ESPN says it is simply following an editorial and programming strategy that focuses on sports, not politics. The firestorm began over the weekend when Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong, prompting Chinese organizations and firms to suspend relationships with the American basketball league. On Tuesday, sports blog Deadspin reported that Chuck Salituro, a senior news director at ESPN, issued a memo ""mandating that any discussion of the Daryl Morey story avoid any political discussions about China and Hong Kong, and instead focus on the related basketball issues."" The memo ""explicitly discouraged any political discussion about China and Hong Kong,"" Deadspin's Laura Wagner reported. That approach sparked a wave of disapproval of ESPN, owned by Disney (DIS). ""While the NBA finds its backbone to resist China's censorship, ESPN caves in, insisting that its journalists describe the controversy without mentioning the pro-democracy Hong Kong protests at its foundation,"" Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, tweeted. ""This is pathetic. Yet another American company that's allowing China to dictate their actions,"" tweeted US Senator Rick Scott of Florida. ""@espn (and it's parent company, @Disney) should use its platform to shine a light on Communist China's oppression of the people of Hong Kong, not shy away from it."" ESPN declined to comment. But a source at the network pushed back on the contention that it was doing anything surprising or unusual. While there was no all-staff memo, there were a few guidance emails sent to key staffers, the source said. And the guidance was essentially a reminder to cover the NBA story through ESPN's typical sports lens, in line with what the network has been saying publicly for 18 months — that pure politics is not in its lane, but the intersection of politics and sports is. This approach has been described as a no-pure-politics policy. It was instituted after a series of controversies involving ESPN and politics and ensuing debates about whether the network was turning off conservative sports fans. When Jimmy Pitaro took over ESPN as its president in 2018, he sought to change what he called a ""false narrative"" about ESPN that portrayed the network as a ""political organization."" Pitaro told the Washington Post that ""I have been very, very clear with employees here that it is not our jobs to cover politics, purely."" "	CNN
57	https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/08/politics/nba-china-controversy-trump/index.html	Updated 6:49 PM ET, Tue October 8, 2019	Donald Trump's notable silence on the NBA-China showdown	"(CNN)President Donald Trump isn't someone who usually limits his commentary -- especially on Twitter -- to simply political matters. And one of his favorite subjects on which to opine is sports -- the NBA in particular. ""LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon,"" Trump tweeted in August 2018. ""He made LeBron look smart, which isn't easy to do. I like Mike!"" In November 2017, Trump tweeted this: ""Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!"" And just a few months before that, Trump had this to say on Twitter about the Golden State Warriors: ""Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!"" All of which makes Trump's silence amid a massive controversy over a tweet -- since deleted -- by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey expressing support for the pro-democracy Hong Kong protesters all the more intriguing. Morey's tweet drew rebukes from the Chinese, and several Chinese businesses suspended operations with the Rockets. On Tuesday, CCTV, which is part of China's state-run TV service, said they would cease broadcasting playoff games because ""we believe any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability do not belong to the category of free speech."" After a disastrous initial response from the NBA that tried to placate China -- a massive consumer of the NBA and its related merchandise, etc. -- Commissioner Adam Silver made clear that the league stands behind the right of Morey and its players to express their own opinions. ""We are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression,"" Silver said in Tokyo on Tuesday, adding: ""I do know there are consequences from freedom of speech; we will have to live with those consequences. For those who question our motivation, this is about far more than growing our business."" So Silver -- and the broader NBA -- got to the right place on the issue (democracy + free speech are more important than pure profit). Eventually. Which brings me to Trump. As CNN reported last week, Trump, in a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, promised that the US would stay quiet on the Hong Kong protests while the two countries continued to negotiate a possible end to the ongoing trade war. File that in the the things-that-make-you-go-hmmm category.   The Point: Adam Silver made clear on Tuesday that principle comes before profit. Will Donald Trump do the same? "	CNN
58	https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/08/politics/republican-defenses-for-trump-against-impeachment-inquiry/index.html	Updated 5:33 PM ET, Tue October 8, 2019	Here are the most common reasons Republicans use to defend Trump against impeachment	"Washington (CNN)Over the past few weeks, many Republicans have gone to bat for President Donald Trump, using a few standard arguments to defend him against the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry.  Here's a look at the most common GOP defenses for why the President shouldn't face an impeachment inquiry, and the facts around those arguments. No quid pro quo One line that Republicans have continually repeated is that there was no quid pro quo involved in Trump's call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. This, despite the fact that in the rough transcript of the call, Trump says, ""I would like you to do us a favor though,"" after Zelensky mentions his desire to purchase more Javelin missiles from the US. Still, the no quid pro quo defense was among the list of talking points the White House sent around to Republicans on how to respond to criticism of Trump's call with Zelensky, and which was then accidentally sent to House Democrats. Within hours of the White House releasing the transcript, a number of Senate Republicans were using the ""no quid pro quo"" line. ""I've read the transcript in its entirety. It shows that there was no quid pro quo,"" Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley told CNN. ""It reveals no quid pro quo,"" Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey said to Politico. The next day, on NPR's All Things Considered, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan echoed that talking point, saying, ""When you read the transcript, there is nothing there... there was no quid pro quo."" Over the past two weeks, Rep. Mark Meadows has tweeted several times that the idea there was quid pro quo is ridiculous. ""Seeing some try to spin this section of the call into 'quid pro quo' and it's laughable. To put it mildly,"" he wrote on September 25. Some experts have noted that because the US is Ukraine's most powerful ally, and much of the country's safety from Russia depends on US support, all requests from President Trump come with some kind of underlying pressure. The question of quid pro quo is a moot point for many Democrats weighing whether to impeach the President, seeing as how there is no disputing that Trump did ask a foreign government to investigate a political opponent during an election season. Hours before announcing a formal impeachment inquiry, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said at The Atlantic Festival that ""there is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation."" He's just investigating corruption Republicans also tend to argue that Trump is simply trying to uncover corruption by asking other countries to investigate the Bidens. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise said on MSNBC September 29 that in their conversation ""(Zelensky) and President Trump are talking about...things that both of them are doing to clean up corruption and drain the swamp."" On October 4, Sen. Ron Johnson told reporters that Trump is ""concerned about corruption"" and that he takes ""what President Trump is saying at face value."" Given Trump's past statements and actions, there is reason to be suspicious of his claims that this has nothing to do with politics, and that his sole motivation is to clean up corruption. In the transcript of his phone call with Zelensky, Trump never mentions ""corruption"" and only focuses on conspiracy theories around the DNC server, a US cybersecurity firm, and the Bidens. There's no evidence to support any of the theories mentioned by Trump. Trump has also defended and expressed sympathy for his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who spent years working for the corrupt (and pro-Putin) former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Manafort is currently in prison for tax fraud. The whistleblower only had secondhand knowledge Republicans have also repeatedly argued that the whistleblower's complaint is not credible because he only had secondhand knowledge of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky. Rep. Kevin McCarthy tweeted on September 29 that one of the most important facts was that ""the whistleblower wasn't on the call."" Sen. Lindsey Graham told CBS that the whistleblower complaint was ""all hearsay,"" arguing that because ""the whistleblower didn't hear the phone call"" then the complaint ""is a sham."" The intelligence community's inspector general, Michael Atkinson, debunked the notion that the allegations against Trump were all based on hearsay, writing in a September 30 letter that the whistleblower did have ""direct knowledge of certain alleged conduct"" and this information significantly helped the IG in reaching a ""credible"" determinate. That hasn't stopped Republicans from repeating the notion that the complaint against Trump is based on hearsay. ""You think about what the Democrats are trying to do,"" Jordan said October 8, ""impeach the President of the United States 13 months prior to an election based on an anonymous whistleblower with no firsthand knowledge who has a bias against the President."" The law surrounding whistleblowing in the intelligence community does not prohibit individuals with secondhand information from coming forward. In fact, the inspector general has 14 days to investigate any complaint of urgent concern and within those 14 days, the IG must find firsthand information in order to determine that the urgent concern is ""credible"" and pass it up the command chain. Never mind the fact that Trump has already released the primary document in the complaint: the call with Zelensky. And according to Mark Zaid, the attorney who represents the first whistleblower, a second whistleblower has come forward with firsthand information on some of the allegations in the original complaint. It was a joke Another defense of the President that Republicans have continued to trot out is that the media is taking him too seriously. In other words, that he was joking. This defense has been used in particular to address Trump's request for China to investigate the Bidens. There's no evidence that Trump was joking and Trump has never claimed that he was. Still, that's the argument that both Jordan and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio have made in the past few days. ""I don't think it's a real request,"" Rubio said on October 4. ""I think he did it to get you guys. I think he did it to provoke you to ask me and others and get outraged by it. He plays it like a violin and everyone falls into it. That's not a real request."" Jim Jordan agreed, saying Sunday ""as I think Sen. Rubio said a couple days ago. I think he's getting the press all spun up about this."" CNN has also reported that in June, Trump discussed Biden and Elizabeth Warren on a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping and told Xi that he would keep quiet on Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed. Schiff met with the whistleblower One of the primary tactics Republicans have used when defending Trump is to attack House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff.  ""Schiff didn't even tell us that he had met with the whistleblower prior to the whistleblower filing the complaint,"" Jordan said Tuesday in defense of the Trump administration blocking EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland from testifying before congress.  While Schiff did incorrectly state in a September interview on MSNBC that his committee had not spoken with the whistleblower prior to the complaint being filed, it is also incorrect to claim that Schiff himself met with the whistleblower.  Staffers did have contact with the whistleblower prior to the complaint being filed and advised them to contact the Intelligence Community's Inspector General. While Schiff did have general knowledge about the concerns of the whistleblower, there is no evidence that he had met with the whistleblower. "	CNN

Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. US and Turkey In a stunning change in US foreign policy, the White House announced last night that US forces would step aside as Turkey plans a military offensive against the Kurds in northern Syria. The move is astonishing because the US-backed Kurdish forces have been America's most reliable partners in Syria and played a huge role in the fight against ISIS. Turkey has long considered the US-backed Kurdish militia YPG as a terrorist group and has wanted to eliminate it. The White House added Turkey would now be responsible for all captured ISIS fighters who are currently being held by US-backed Kurdish forces in northern Syria. The announcement followed a phone call between President Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. There are about 1,000 US troops operating in northeastern Syria right now. 2. Impeachment inquiry There's now a second whistleblower accusing President Trump of abusing his power. Attorney Mark Zaid, who is one of the lawyers for the first whistleblower, told CNN he and his team of lawyers are now representing a second person. This person works in the intelligence community, has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The White House downplayed this revelation, with press secretary Stephanie Grisham saying ""it doesn't change the fact that (Trump) has done nothing wrong."" The President is under fire for a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump is accused of trying to get Ukraine's help to dig up dirt on a political opponent.

Hong Kong protests It was another violent weekend in Hong Kong, as anti-government protesters barged through parts of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, attacking and vandalizing subway stations and Chinese-linked businesses. Subways are closed in Hong Kong for an unprecedented fourth day. Thousands marched on Sunday against a new law that bans people from wearing face masks in public. The law stoked a swift backlash and sparked fears about a crackdown on civil liberties. During the march a driver mowed down some protesters with a taxi cab. The driver was then severely beaten by a crowd. Fallout from the marches has even reached the world of professional basketball. The general manager for the NBA's Houston Rockets tweeted out a message of support for the protests. That caused a firestorm in China, with several Chinese businesses suspending ties with the team. The general manager later apologized. 4. Kansas City bar shooting A suspect has been arrested in a bar shooting in Kansas City, Kansas, over the weekend that killed four people. Javier Alatorre, 23, was arrested yesterday and was charged with four counts of first-degree murder. Police are also searching for a second suspect, Hugo Villanueva-Morales. It's believed an argument inside the bar hours earlier may have led to the shooting, where two men walked into the bar with handguns and opened fire. There were about 40 people inside the bar at the time. 5. Homeless men attacked A man was arrested in attacks on the homeless in Manhattan over the weekend that left four men dead. Randy Rodriguez Santos was arrested and charged with four counts of murder. He's accused of hitting homeless men in their heads with a metal object -- which police believe was a pipe -- while the men slept in the city's Chinatown neighborhood. Right now police say the attacks were random. Santos is also homeless.

She served on President Barack Obama's National Security Council from 2009 to 2013 and at the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush. Follow her @sam_vinograd. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)The litany of offenses allegedly committed by members of the Trump administration continues to grow. As a result of President Trump's own conversation coming to light and the whistleblower complaint, leaked communications and congressional inquiries, the world is learning more about Trump and his closest advisers.  Convincing our global counterparts that the administration was fully focused on their day jobs was a hard sell at any point in this presidency -- but it's even harder now. In light of these new revelations, even if members of the Trump White House are now ready to dive into national security work with their counterparts overseas, it is unlikely that their peers and allies are willing to work with them as substantively. Don't phone a friend One of the most important things the national security team can do right now is to convince Trump not to speak with any foreign leaders. His track record of asking foreign powers to investigate his 2020 political rival -- whether it be with Ukraine or China or Australia -- means his phone calls have become a liability, rather than an opportunity to advance US foreign policy objectives. And leaders, at least ones from healthy democracies, will likely shy away from speaking with Trump for fear of being embroiled in any abuses of power or criminal activity. They'll also be wary of the possibility that any communication with Trump will end up as part of a congressional inquiry or leaked to the media. This means that Trump will likely end up speaking with leaders who only want to manipulate him and diminish his credibility further. Acting chief of what? As acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney is responsible for a lot of the activities currently being investigated by Congress. This includes potential misuse of classified systems to hide readouts of presidential calls or to try to silence whistleblower complaints, efforts to freeze security assistance to Ukraine, the approval process for the conditions of a Ukrainian White House visit and a failure to raise alarm bells over abusive behavior by the President. (Meanwhile, the White House has called the impeachment inquiry a ""kangaroo court"" and said that any investigation will show that the President did nothing wrong.) The House issued a subpoena to the White House on Friday -- with a letter addressed to Mulvaney -- and the list of alleged bad behavior that happened under his watch deserves real scrutiny. Thus far, Mulvaney does not appear to have followed in the footsteps of previous chiefs of staff who worked to ensure that wrongdoing within the White House, and among the cabinet, was dealt with head on, rather than supported or condoned. His role in overseeing a White House racked by misbehavior -- and the fact that he may have coordinated with Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and the State Department on a quid pro quo with Ukraine -- mean that the only way that counterparts probably view him is as the chief of staff to a corruption clique. The White House maintains that Mulvaney has acted appropriately and discounts any reporting that Trump is disappointed in his acting chief of staff. The President's personal envoy As the country's chief diplomat, the Secretary of State's reputation abroad relies on the perception that he operates in the best interests of his or her country. In that regard, Secretary Mike Pompeo's reputation has taken a serious hit. He acknowledged that he was on a call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his potential 2020 political rival, Joe Biden, along with his son, Hunter. (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden). And, on Saturday, Pompeo said that he's been on most of Trump's foreign calls. Pompeo's peers who believe in the rule of law have every reason to step back from working with him on key issues like anti-corruption and even foreign assistance, knowing that he was at least a party to a discussion that appears to be an abuse of power. Pompeo's credibility has also taken a hit when it comes to speaking out about China's abuses or the importance of democracy, for example. Other countries have less reason to take him seriously, since he may have been aware of a call in which two sources familiar with the call told CNN that the President said he'd keep quiet about the Hong Kong protests while US-China trade talks are ongoing. Election security is another area where other countries may step back from working with Pompeo. He said last week that the US won't tolerate election meddling. And he should be working with other countries to stop it. But he was on the call when Trump asked Ukraine to interfere in our 2020 election by investigating Biden. But it gets worse for Pompeo and his State Department. Text messages between two senior officials working for Pompeo -- US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland and former Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker -- paint them as serving Giuliani and Trump's personal agenda rather than doing their actual jobs. Sondland's focus is supposed to be in Brussels, where he and his team should serve as the ""direct link"" between the US and the European Union. Volker was the Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations at the State Department, where he should have been spending time helping to broker negotiations on key issues like Ukraine's ongoing conflict with Russia in eastern Ukraine and Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. And yet both of these men were freelancing with Giuliani rather than doing the jobs that taxpayers pay them to do. While a member of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, Pompeo railed against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for not knowing everything her team was up to in the run-up to that 2012 attack in Libya. But Sondland and Volker's extracurricular activities happened under Pompeo's watch. In short, Pompeo no longer looks like he's operating from a baseline position of advancing democratic values and US national security. Intelligence officers step back Our intelligence relationships have been strained ever since Trump came into office and began declassifying sensitive information, threatening to expose sources and methods, undercutting intelligence community analysis and more. Now, however, there are more questions about how intelligence is being weaponized by the President. Attorney General William Barr's global conspiracy tour -- in which he's asking foreign officials to work with him to investigate the origins of the Russia investigation that led to the Special Counsel probe -- diminishes the chances that any intelligence officials worth their salt will work with us as fully. In my experience, intelligence in democracies is supposed to be an unbiased input to policy, not a political tool. Plus, there are real questions about how the US intelligence community responded to the President's actions. It is more than likely that as part of their collection on foreign sources, intelligence analysts learned that the President said he was ""unconcerned"" about Russian election interference or asked foreign leaders to investigate Biden. We don't know what happened to this intelligence and whether it was flagged to the FBI. While we wait for answers, one thing is certain -- the hard work of the US intelligence community has been denigrated by the President's actions over and over again, and that's going to cause our intelligence partners to question whether it's worth the risk of maintaining relationships with us if their own highly sensitive work might be caught up in the maelstrom of malign behavior. And all of this is bad news for national security as foreign counterparts who care about democratic values and the rule of law become even more wary of working with this White House. Members of the administration should have thought about that -- and the Americans they are appointed to serve -- before making so many dangerous decisions. "	CNN

The talking points don't appear to defend the President's behavior on a call flagged in a whistleblower complaint that is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry, which indicated that Trump asked Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's family over baseless corruption claims. The talking points also do not address the text messages released on Thursday between US diplomats and a senior Ukrainian aide showing how a potential Ukrainian investigation into the 2016 election was linked to a desired meeting between Zelensky and Trump. Though the RNC talking points hit at the credibility of the whistleblower, the whistleblower's allegations have, so far, matched what intelligence officials have found. In addition, the talking points do not address new reporting indicating that Trump similarly talked about Biden and another presidential rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, on a June 18 call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He raised their political prospects, according to two people familiar with the discussion. In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed. Among the talking points is the point that Democrats are refusing to hold an impeachment inquiry vote on the House floor, a point made in recent days from high-profile Republican lawmakers. The full House voted to authorize impeachment inquiries for Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. But Democrats say there's nothing in the rules or the Constitution requiring such a vote, and the current House rules give the committees the tools they need already to conduct an inquiry, like subpoena power. Pelosi reiterated that defense in a letter responding to a similar request by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Thursday afternoon. She also said she hopes McCarthy and other GOP members ""share our commitment to following the facts, upholding the Constitution, protecting our national security, and defending the integrity of our elections at such a serious moment in our nation's history."" RNC spokesman Steve Guest told CNN in a statement Friday afternoon, ""As we have reiterated multiple times in multiple ways, President Trump did nothing wrong."" This comes as White House officials are developing their own impeachment strategy. Trump on Friday insisted that there was no quid pro quo in his dealings with Ukraine, despite the material in the newly released text messages. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump was asked about the text messages. He claimed he didn't know the ambassadors involved in the messaging. He repeated there was no quid pro quo, but said he would continue asking foreign countries for help investigating corruption. White House officials have been largely sidelined as the President and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani take command of the anti-impeachment narrative, at times driving the news cycle in ways White House allies believe hurt the President's case -- or, at a minimum, make his position harder to defend -- administration officials and sources close to the White House said. But inside the White House, officials have begun to ""unwind"" the timeline and circumstances surrounding the President's call with Zelensky, one White House official said. The goal, according to the official, is to ensure the White House has a full picture of the events in hand as it fields inquiries from Congress and prepares to build the President's defense to impeachment. The effort has involved lawyers in the White House counsel's office and Situation Room staff who are involved in connecting the President with foreign leaders and compiling a record of those calls. Also, Trump and top officials, including his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, have dismissed the need for a war room to bolster the White House's response to Democrats' impeachment inquiry, as President Bill Clinton's White House established when he faced impeachment. Officials said Mulvaney and Kushner are the officials most focused on developing an impeachment strategy. This story has been updated with additional developments Friday."	CNN

Navarro added, ""Okay? Not confirm or deny. Because that's the slippery slope."" CNN first reported on Thursday that during a phone call with China's Xi Jinping on June 18, President Donald Trump raised Biden's political prospects as well as those of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, according to two people familiar with the discussion. The White House record of that call was later stored in the highly secured electronic system used to house a now-infamous June 25 phone call with Ukraine's president. That call helped spark a whistleblower complaint which led House Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry into Trump. Asked earlier this week about Trump's call with Xi, the White House did not deny that he raised the topic of Biden. In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed. On Thursday, Trump singled out China to investigate the Bidens. ""China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,"" Trump told reporters during a news conference at the White House. Navarro also touted the latest numbers on the economy, telling Sciutto: ""We have 3.5% unemployment rate, impeach that."" In September, the unemployment rate fell to the lowest rate since December 1969, as employers added 136,000 jobs to the US economy -- amid signs that the global economy is slowing. CORRECTION: The headline and story have been updated to accurately reflect Navarro's statement about whether he ever personally raised investigating Joe Biden or his son during contacts with Chinese officials.

63	https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/03/politics/impeachment-tracker-october-3/index.html	Updated 9:28 AM ET, Fri October 4, 2019	Here are the top 10 latest developments on Trump, Ukraine and China	"(CNN)Here are the 10 most important developing highlights as President Donald Trump faces impeachment proceedings. The Latest Trump's defense is offense Attack, attack -- Trump's overt effort to normalize foreigners interfering in US elections goes along with his increasing attacks on Democrats; he says House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff is a ""lowlife"" and a ""liar."" He attacks the whistleblower as totally wrong, but he's admitted the rough transcript of his phone call, which is the bulk of the whistleblower complaint, is completely right. Make it normal -- And by publicly doing what he did on the phone transcript, Trump's trying to make it OK. Will Republicans buy it? -- Republicans have mostly held their noses when it comes to concerns about Trump's interactions with foreign leaders. The key question going forward in this impeachment inquiry is whether they -- especially those in office, but also those who vote -- buy into the idea that it's okay to ask foreign governments for political oppo.  A favor from China, too Asked what he wanted from Ukraine's President, Trump said: ""It's a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens. Because how does a company that's newly formed and all these companies, if you look -- by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens.""  What it means: Trump either truly does not understand that a President should not be coordinating with foreign powers or he's trying to make it OK by saying it over and over again and in public. See! He's not trying to hide a thing! Except it's still not OK according to US law. What does he want for it: The subtext for every Trump interaction with China is the trade war he started with that country and the trade deal he hopes to secure with it before he faces reelection in 2020. So it's a serious question, as he negotiates with China, whether he'd trade something for an investigation into Biden. Note: There is still no evidence of any wrongdoing by either Biden. But the entire apparatus of conservative media and Republican Trump supporters are turning around to aim directly at Biden and his credibility. This is going to be their mantra. Why not ask China for help? Biden supporter Nick Burns, a former career diplomat who worked for Republicans and Democrats at the State Department, explains on CNN: ""The President is asking this morning China, an authoritarian dictatorship to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden who I'm supporting in this campaign. That is corruption. No prior president would ever go there. It's legally wrong. It's morally wrong. And the President has to hear that from people on Capitol Hill, especially from Republican senators and Republican members of the house. His own party."" Trump targets Schiff on process  House Intelligence Committee chairman and Pelosi's impeachment front man Adam Schiff is quickly becoming the top target both for Trump and his supporters on Capitol Hill.  First, Schiff read satirical quotes attributed to Trump at a House hearing with the director of national intelligence. Then, The New York Times reported Schiff's committee had some contact with the whistleblower and told the whistleblower to seek counsel, ushering his complaint forward. Trump was carrying that story around in his pocket Wednesday and alleging Schiff may have helped write the complaint (both the whistleblower's attorneys and Schiff deny this). On Thursday, Trump called Schiff a liar and he and other Republicans called on Schiff to resign from his committee and the impeachment inquiry. More  Republicans issue impeachment demands House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called for a halt to the impeachment inquiry unless certain demands are met, including a vote to officially authorize the inquiry and subpoena power for Republicans, as minorities had in previous impeachment efforts. He had other demands, but since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi moved to the inquiry without a vote and by fiat, it's unlikely McCarthy's letter will have any effect. Protect the whistleblower John Dean, the Watergate whistleblower, writes for CNN about how he was protected by the US Marshal's Service when he was about to drop a dime on Nixon. He says the whistleblower today should get the same treatment, except quietly, since he's concerned about Bill Barr -- the top law enforcement official in the country -- or Trump -- the President -- knowing about it. FEC shade for Trump After Trump's plea to China and Ukraine, FEC Chair Ellen Weintraub retweeted herself from this summer. ""Let me make something 100% clear to the American public and anyone running for public office: It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election,"" Weintraub said back in June. ""This is not a novel concept.""  If an investigation into his rival is of value to Trump, his request to China and Ukraine would be illegal.  Coming Friday What's happening: Inspector General for the Intelligence Community Michael Atkinson will testify behind closed doors on Capitol Hill.  What to watch for: Details about the additional information supporting the whistleblower Atkinson uncovered. "	CNN
64	https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/04/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-china-calls/index.html	Updated 9:06 AM ET, Fri October 4, 2019	Why the Ukraine and China calls may be only the tip of the Trump iceberg	"(CNN)The Ukraine call wasn't a bug of this administration. It was a feature. President Donald Trump's efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate debunked allegations of corruption against former Vice President Joe Biden were part of a pattern of behavior. As CNN reported Thursday night: ""During a phone call with [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] on June 18, Trump raised Biden's political prospects as well as those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who by then had started rising in the polls, according to two people familiar with the discussion. In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed."" That call was then put into a special, secure electronic system -- the same one where the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky was placed. So, within five weeks this summer, we have Trump on the phone with a foreign leader discussing, at a minimum, his potential 2020 opponents. And at least in the Ukraine call, making clear that he wanted a ""favor"" for all of the things the US was doing -- and could do -- for the country. All of which means that, almost certainly, these are not the only two calls of this sort that Trump has placed. If Trump is willing to talk about Biden and Warren with the Chinese -- not exactly an ally -- or to float an unspoken quid pro quo with Ukraine, who would he not be willing to talk to or use American power as a lever against? The answer is, of course, no one. Don't believe me? Just listen to Trump. ""Well I would think that if they were honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the Bidens,"" Trump said of the Ukrainians on Thursday. ""It's a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens."" He added: ""Likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine. So, I would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens."" He said the quiet part out loud! Why? Because Trump sees nothing wrong with using his perch as the President of the United States to strong-arm world leaders into doing his political bidding. He's President! He can do what he wants! And who is pro-corruption anyway? ""As the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!,"" tweeted Trump Thursday night. He later added this on top of that tweet: ""This isn't about a Campaign, this is about Corruption on a massive scale!"" (Irony alert...) On Friday morning, Trump was at it again. ""As President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries,"" he tweeted. ""It is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption!"" What Trump doesn't get -- or chooses not to get -- is that there's a big difference between rooting out corruption and using (and abusing) the power of America to pressure foreign countries to dig dirt on your two main political opponents in the 2020 election. Especially when, in the case of Biden and Ukraine, there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. That fundamental misunderstanding of how a president should -- and should not -- use the power of his office is the only explanation for why Trump would release the rough transcript of his call with Zelensky, which, if not a smoking gun, is pretty close. This sort of behavior isn't aberrant to, or for, Trump. In fact, it's entirely consistent with who he has been his whole life -- always looking for leverage to be used to personal advantage. Being elected president didn't change that worldview. It just gave Trump more power to play with. Add it all up and you get this: There will very likely be more calls and conversations like the ones we've learned about of late between Trump and foreign leaders. This is who Trump is. This is what he does. "	CNN

""As the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!"" Trump tweeted. ""This isn't about a Campaign,"" he added in a separate tweet, ""this is about Corruption on a massive scale!"" Trump's tweets Thursday night come after he told reporters at the White House earlier in the day that he wanted both Ukraine and China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. The comments join a flurry of defiant statements and falsehoods from the President in recent days after the launch of the House impeachment inquiry last week. There is no evidence of wrongdoing in Ukraine by Joe or Hunter Biden. There's also no evidence that the former vice president received any money from China, and a lawyer for Hunter Biden pushed back on Trump's characterization, calling it ""a gross misrepresentation."" CNN reported Thursday that Trump had raised Biden's political prospects as well as those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another Democratic presidential candidate, during a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping on June 18, according to two people familiar with the discussion. In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed. News of the President's conversation with Xi comes after a whistleblower complaint released this past week alleged that Trump had abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election and that the White House had taken steps to cover it up. Trump has denied any wrongdoing. A rough transcript released by the White House shows Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate Biden, the President's potential 2020 political rival, and his son Hunter Biden. Trump's tweets Thursday night echoed his news conference Wednesday, where his rage over the impeachment inquiry spilled into the public eye in a combative showing alongside Finland's President. ""This is the greatest hoax. This is just a continuation of what's been playing out since my election,"" Trump said during the East Room news conference, which became progressively more heated as the President faced questions about his predicament. ""This is a fraudulent crime on the American people."""	CNN
66	https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/03/politics/trump-biden-call-xi-secure-server/index.html	Updated 10:30 PM ET, Thu October 3, 2019	Trump raised Biden with Xi in June call housed in highly secure server	"Washington (CNN)When President Donald Trump suggested — without prompting — that China should investigate Joe Biden and his son, he thrust another political grudge into what was already the world's most complicated and consequential relationship. The move startled Chinese officials, who say they have little interest in becoming embroiled in a US political controversy. And it amounted to the latest extraordinary effort by Trump to openly request political assistance from foreign governments. Thursday's comments weren't the first time Trump has injected Biden into his relationship with China, though he said Thursday he has never pushed Xi to investigate the former vice president. Nor is it the first time he has sought to trade favors with Xi, who this week celebrated the 70th birthday of his communist state with a note of congratulations from Trump. During a phone call with Xi on June 18, Trump raised Biden's political prospects as well as those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who by then had started rising in the polls, according to two people familiar with the discussion. In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed. The White House record of that call was later stored in the highly secured electronic system used to house a now-infamous phone call with Ukraine's President and which helped spark a whistleblower complaint that's led Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry into Trump. Asked earlier this week about Trump's call with Xi, the White House did not deny that he raised Biden. ""World leaders need to be able to speak freely in their conversations with the President--that is a key component to effective diplomacy. And that is why such conversations are kept confidential,"" said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. ""We are not going to start discussing the contents of every conversation President Trump has with world leaders, other than to say his conversations are always appropriate."" After this story published, Warren reacted to news of Trump's call with Xi, writing on Twitter, ""Trump can say what he wants about me, but it's outrageous that any president would sell out the people of Hong Kong behind closed doors. The public must see the transcript of Trump's call with Xi. And we need a leader who will stand up for our values."" On Thursday, Trump told reporters at the White House he'd consider asking his counterpart in Beijing to investigate the Bidens, adding to a growing list of foreign leaders he's tried to enlist in his attempts to bring down a potential Democratic challenger. ""It's certainly something we can start thinking about,"" Trump said when questioned whether he would seek the help of Xi in investigating Biden. ""Because I'm sure that President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny."" Scramble for clarity Trump's comments sparked confusion and a scramble for explanation from Chinese officials. ""Are you asking about the comments that Trump just made? I don't think I can tell you anything in this regard right now,"" said one Chinese diplomat when questioned on Thursday about Trump's remarks. ""This is quite chaotic,"" the diplomat said. ""We do not want to get in the middle of the US politics."" One Trump ally outside the White House described receiving a message from Chinese government officials asking if Trump was serious when he suggested China open an investigation into Biden. The response: investigating corruption is an easy way to earn goodwill with Trump. The Chinese did not immediately clarify if they would be launching an investigation -- or if they would make it public if they do. Looming trade talks As trade negotiators prepare for another round of talks and as Xi contends with domestic challenges like the Hong Kong unrest, the Biden matter throws another wrench into tangled but high-stakes diplomacy. Trump's reluctance over the summer to speak out against a crackdown against pro-Democracy protesters in Hong Kong has frustrated officials at the National Security Council and State Department, who had been advocating a firmer US stance. While Trump eventually did tweet out a call for Xi to find a ""humane"" resolution to the Hong Kong unrest, he did not issue a forceful call to uphold human rights in the former British colony. And as protests again erupted this week as massive celebrations were underway in Beijing for the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, Trump offered Xi his congratulations. ""Congratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People's Republic of China!"" Trump wrote, adopted a drastically different tone than his Republican allies, who used words like ""ghoulish,"" ""authoritarian"" and ""horrors"" to mark the occasion. Trump's remarks Thursday have caused consternation among some of his aides, who have privately pined for an end to a trade war that is starting to take a toll on the US economy.  Only minutes before suggesting China investigate Biden, Trump implied he held the upper hand with China in trade talks, which are set to pick up next week when China's chief negotiator comes to Washington. ""I have a lot of options on China,"" Trump said. ""But if they don't do what we want, we have tremendous power."" Already, some of the President's trade advisers say they believe China is watching the Democratic primary closely, making calculations on whether to agree to a new deal with Trump based on the prospects of various candidates. Biden allegations On several occasions, Trump has intimated that the Bidens have received millions of dollars from China, implying they capitalized on the then-vice president's political power and connections. The allegations stem partly from an official trip both Bidens took to China in 2013, meant as a diplomatic mission to help ease tensions in the region. A company on whose board Hunter Biden sat received a large investment of Chinese capital shortly after the trip. According to the New York Times, Hunter has a 10% interest in BHR Partners, a private-equity fund that the Chinese government-owned Bank of China has invested in. As of May 2019, both The New York Times and the Washington Post reported that Hunter had not received any money from the fund or in connection with his role as an unpaid advisory board member. In July 2019, more than two years after his father left office, Hunter purchased an equity stake in the BHR fund, valued around $430,000, according to the Washington Post. There is no evidence the former vice president received money from China, and last week one of Hunter Biden's lawyers told the Washington Post that he hadn't received any ""return or compensation on account of this investment or his position on the board of directors."" Hunter Biden's lawyer has also said he did not conduct any business related to the investment fund during the 2013 trip, on which he was accompanied by one of his daughters. In a statement after Trump's comments on Thursday, Biden's deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield called his comments ""a grotesque choice of lies over truth and self over the country."" Biden's successor, however, made clear he saw nothing wrong with Trump's behavior. ""The President made it very clear that he believes our other nations around the world should look into it as well,"" Vice President Mike Pence said during an appearance in Arizona, where he was working to sell a new North American trade deal. ""The simple fact is that, you know, when you hold the second highest office in the land, it comes with unique responsibilities. Not just to be above impropriety but to be above the appearance of impropriety,"" Pence said. Privately, Trump has been telling allies over the past week he believes Hunter Biden's activities in China to be potentially more damaging than his business in Ukraine. ""That's not the best one. The best one was China,"" Trump said at a private event in New York last week after going on a screed about the unfounded claims involving the Bidens and Ukraine. Trump's insistence that Hunter Biden profited off his father's political position is not without irony. Beijing granted approval for fashion and accessory trademarks to Trump's daughter Ivanka last year, even after she shuttered her eponymous brand in July 2018 because of slow sales. The President's attempts to build a relationship with Xi have proceeded in fits and starts since taking office. He was feted with a grand state visit during his first year in office, sipping tea with Xi inside the Forbidden City. He later reciprocated by hosting Xi at Mar-a-Lago. But he's not the only player in the impeachment saga with close ties to Xi. Biden was tasked during the Obama administration with courting then-Vice President Xi during his apprenticeship for China's top job. They traveled together both in the US and China. ""I've spent as much time with Xi Jinping as anybody has,"" Biden has boasted on campaign trail, hoping to burnish his foreign policy credentials. The story has been updated with comment from the White House and Elizabeth Warren. "	CNN
67	https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/01/asia/hong-kong-oct-1-protests-escalation-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 3:06 AM ET, Wed October 2, 2019	Man shot with live round in major escalation of Hong Kong protests	"Hong Kong (CNN)A young protester was shot with a live round as violent protests erupted across Hong Kong on the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China on Tuesday, in one of the most chaotic days of almost four months of political unrest. Police said an officer ""fired a live round"" and an 18-year-old man was ""injured near his left shoulder at about 4 p.m."" in the Tsuen Wan district of the New Territories. The incident marked a major escalation in violence that could galvanize the protests further. While it was not the first time police had fired live shots during 17 weeks of unrest, it marked the first use of lethal force since the protests began. Police said at a briefing Wednesday morning that officers fired a total of six live shots during protests across Hong Kong Tuesday. Protesters and police clashed in at least eight areas of the city, with violent pitch battles lasting throughout the day and late into the evening. Black-clad protesters hurled petrol bombs, set fire to subway station entrances and trash cans, and vandalized government and public buildings. Police responded by firing multiple rounds of tear gas, rubber bullets and blue dye from a water cannon. Some 180 people were arrested on Tuesday for offenses including taking part in a riot, unlawful assembly, assaulting a police officer and possession of an offensive weapon, according to police. Use of lethal force According to his school principle, the protester shot by police underwent surgery for his injuries, Tse Yun-ming, headteacher of Tsuen Wan Public Ho Chuen Yiu Memorial College, said Wednesday. Current and former students staged a sit-in at the school Wednesday to protest the shooting. They held banners reading, ""Police brutality is rampant. They murder students"" and chanted, ""Hong Kong police murder with intentions."" The school said it would provide support to any students who might want to boycott classes later. The 18-year-old is under arrest for assaulting a police officer and could face further arrests for rioting, a source told CNN. The police officer who fired his weapon at the protesters remains on active duty and per police department procedures, will need to see a psychologist and do a post shooting stress exam. The protester has not been officially identified by police or the school. He is in a stable condition, the Queen Elizabeth Hospital's media department said Wednesday. In a statement, police said during dispersal operations a ""large group of rioters attacked officers with iron poles, seriously threatening their lives."" Police Public Relations Branch Senior Superintendent Yolanda Yu told reporters that officers ""warned the attacker but he continued to violently attack the police."" ""Police officers at the scene, whose lives were seriously threatened, fired a live round in order to protect himself and his colleagues,"" she added. A video uploaded by Campus TV, a Hong Kong University student media organization, appears to show the moment a police officer shot the man. The video shows black-clad protesters attacking a number of police officers with metal bars and other weapons. It also appears to show the individual striking a police officer with a pole just before the officer deployed his firearm. Clashes across the city In a statement, police said protesters ""violent acts are spreading and escalating drastically."" ""Public safety has been jeopardized and the public order of the whole city is being pushed to the verge of a very dangerous situation,"" it said. Throughout Tuesday wildcat protests brought chaos and disruption to neighborhoods on Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories. Authorities closed at least 46 subway stations, including the entire Tsuen Wan line, which runs from Hong Kong Island to the northwestern New Territories. Earlier in the day, thousands of people joined an unauthorized march from the Causeway Bay shopping district on Hong Kong Island. The protests soon turned violent in several districts across the city. A large blaze was seen in Wong Tai Sin in Kowloon, where a line of motorbikes caught fire. In Tsim Sha Tsui district, large numbers of protesters wearing black faced off with riot police. Trash cans were set on fire and placed in front of the closed subway station, and police responded by firing more than 20 rounds of tear gas. In Sham Shui Po, protesters set fire to a subway entrance and pointed fireworks and lasers at a government building. Police said protesters threw corrosive liquid onto people in Tuen Mun in the New Territories, ""causing burn injuries to the officers and reporters."" A total of 104 people were hospitalized because of protests as of 7:30 a.m. Wednesday, the hospital authority said. Significance of October 1 The protests first started in June over a controversial bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China. The bill has since been withdrawn -- one of the protesters' five major demands -- but many remain unsatisfied and have vowed to continue until all demands are met. Tuesday's escalation in violence came as China celebrated 70 years since the founding of the People's Republic. Chinese President Xi Jinping presided over National Day celebrations in Beijing including a massive military parade showing off the latest in the country's advanced weaponry. In a pointed speech from Tiananmen Square, where Mao Zedong declared the founding of the PRC on October 1, 1949, Xi said that China must remain ""committed to the strategy of peaceful reinforcement of one country two systems,"" the framework that governs Hong Kong. For months, people in Hong Kong have speculated that October 1 could be a deadline for Beijing to take action to end the ongoing protests. The anniversary is a significant milestone, and China's leaders will not want it overshadowed. Beijing officials have hinted at the possible deployment of troops in Hong Kong, and Chinese paramilitary police have recently held large drills in the bordering city of Shenzhen. The Hong Kong government has said there is no such deadline for action. In audio leaked to Reuters in early September, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam can be heard reassuring business leaders that ""they and ourselves have no expectations that we could clear up this thing before the 1st of October."""

Prepare to pay up. The Dutch capital will soon have the highest tourist tax in Europe. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Whistleblower controversy An agreement has been reached to have the anonymous whistleblower who filed a complaint against President Trump testify before the House Intelligence Committee. But just when that will happen is still up in the air. Committee chair Adam Schiff says protecting the whistleblower's identity is a primary concern. Trump tweeted up a storm about the whistleblower over the weekend, saying he deserves to ""meet my accuser."" The President's escalating threats prompted lawyers representing the whistleblower to send letters to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, expressing concerns for the person's safety.  2. Jamal Khashoggi killing Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said he didn't order the October 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Bin Salman, in an interview on CBS's ""60 Minutes,"" said he took full responsibility for it though, since the killing was carried out by people working for the Saudi government. The CIA concluded that bin Salman did indeed personally order Khashoggi's murder. Khashoggi was killed and dismembered after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. 3. Hong Kong protests The 17th consecutive weekend of anti-government protests in Hong Kong was one of the most violent. Protesters hurled Molotov cocktails, tossed bricks and lit fires. Police responded with tear gas, a live warning shot and a water cannon that fired blue dye (used to stain protesters to make them easier to identity later). The violence comes right before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, when Beijing hopes to project an image of national strength and unity with huge military parade.  4. Texas deputy killed The death of a trailblazing sheriff's deputy in Harris County, Texas, is being felt worldwide. Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal was shot and killed during a traffic stop Friday. He was an observant Sikh who years ago gained national attention when he got permission to wear a turban as part of his Harris County Sheriff's Office uniform. Now the Sikh community in Houston and around the world is mourning his loss. Thousands of people are expected to gather at a basketball arena in Houston later this week to honor his life.  5. Weather It's not October yet but Montana is already covered with almost two feet of snow. A winter storm is still blowing through the state and other parts of the Rockies. A winter-storm warning will be in effect for portions of north-central Montana through this morning. In addition to the snow, there are reports of downed trees and power lines. Snow in September in this part of the country isn't all that uncommon, but the amount of snow is unusual for this time of the year. Meanwhile, way out in the Atlantic, Hurricane Lorenzo is churning through the ocean as a Category 3 storm. Lorenzo briefly was a powerful Category 5 storm over the weekend before it weakened. It's the strongest hurricane recorded so far north and east in the Atlantic basin. Lorenzo is expected to pass over the Azores islands in a few days. BREAKFAST BROWSE People are talking about these.

70	https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/27/success/questions-to-ask-during-interview/index.html	Updated 8:56 AM ET, Fri September 27, 2019	The best questions to ask in a job interview	"(CNN)You probably spend a lot of time prepping for job interviews. But it's not just about being ready with answers to the interviewer's questions. The process is a two-way street: You should come prepared with insightful questions to learn more about the role and to make sure the company is a good fit. ""Asking questions during a job interview is a way of showing engagement in the conversation and telegraphing your interest in the position,"" said Dorie Clark, author of ""Entrepreneurial You."" ""If you just respond to the question posed, you seem very passive and that is not necessarily a trait employers want."" The key to asking questions that will impress is doing your research and listening. Ask about current events Be sure to read the latest press releases, news articles and social media posts from and about the company before heading into the interview and ask relevant questions based on this information. For instance, if there's a recent news story about the company's Chinese operations, Clark said asking something like: I noticed the company had a big roll out in China, I am curious, how do you think the Hong Kong protests will affect it?"" ""It shows you are paying attention and aware of current events and you are in interested in the big pictures, trends and strategy,"" said Clark. Ask what it's like to work there Companies are looking to woo candidates in this job market and want to put their best foot forward -- but it's important that you go into the conversation knowing what you are looking for from an employer. Create a list of your non-negotiables and keep it in mind when asking questions. Asking what a typical day looks like can give you a helpful sense of the workplace balance and responsibilities. ""It gives an opportunity to learn more about how the company works, what priorities a manager sees for your day and whether that aligns with you,"" said Shari Santoriello, a career specialist at career and leadership coaching company Ama la Vida. To get a sense of the corporate culture, Paul Wolfe, senior vice president of global human resources at Indeed, suggested asking: How would you describe the culture here? He added that if you pose this question to every person you interview with, you can see if any common themes emerge or if each person seems to have a different experience -- which could be a red flag. To help get more personal insight into what it's like working at the company, Clark suggested asking: What would you say is the downside about this position or working for the company? ""Every job has a downside and you need to know if you can live with them,"" she said. Ask about career growth and development We all want to work at a place where we have the opportunity to grow professionally. But be careful with how you ask this question. You don't want to come off as if you are expecting a promotion before even starting the job. Try asking: ""What does the career path look like for this role?"" suggested Wolfe. Asking about employee support and development programs can also show how much an employer invests in employee development. ""I always like to ask what the employee support programs look like ... and how I can be involved,"" said Santoriello. ""This shows you are a perpetual learner interested in bringing more value to the company."" Ask how to be successful Knowing how your performance is going to be measured is important so be sure to ask about it. To help get a sense of what employers will be looking for, try asking something like: ""What does success look like for someone in this role?"" or ""How will my performance be evaluated?"" ""It's good to understand what they are going to be focused on and whether that is something you are going to be comfortable with and will resonate with you,"" said Wolfe. Ask spontaneous questions While most interviewers will wrap up the meeting asking if you have any questions, you don't have to wait for that moment. ""You want to make sure you are always dialoguing,"" said Santoriello. If the interviewer says something interesting or vague, ask a question to get more detail. That not only shows you are listening, but also engaged and want to learn more. Just make sure your timing is right when asking questions and avoid interrupting. ""Don't take them off track,"" said Barry Drexler, an interview coach. ""Don't take control of the interview."" And don't ask questions that you can easily find online or to try and show off your knowledge. ""Only ask genuine questions,"" said Drexler. ""I've had so many candidates ask questions trying to impress me with their smartness...they aren't listening. Ask questions to something you need to know to make a decision."" "	CNN

72	https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/19/business/fedex-pilot-detained-china/index.html	Updated 8:03 AM ET, Fri September 20, 2019	A FedEx pilot was arrested by Chinese authorities	"New York (CNN Business)A FedEx pilot was recently detained by Chinese authorities in Guangzhou, a city in southern mainland China. It's the latest in an escalating conflict between the shipping company and the Chinese government. The Hong Kong-based pilot, Todd Hohn, was trying to board a commercial flight home after making a delivery to mainland China, when he was arrested after a luggage search, according to a Wall Street Journal report citing a family lawyer for Hohn. FedEx (FDX) spokesperson Davina Cole on Thursday confirmed to CNN Business that a pilot was arrested. Hohn was carrying ""nonmetallic pellets used in low-power replica air guns,"" leading Chinese authorities to allege he was illegally carrying ammunition, the Journal said. China's foreign ministry confirmed on Friday that a FedEx pilot was detained at Guangzhou airport on September 12 after 681 air-filled pellets were found in his luggage. Customs officials at the airport detained the pilot on allegations of smuggling weapons and ammunition and later released him on bail pending trial, ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a press briefing. Geng did not name the pilot. FedEx said the pilot has been released on bail, though the Journal report states he must remain in mainland China until Chinese authorities have completed their investigation. Hohn is a former US Air Force pilot. ""We are working with the appropriate authorities to gain a better understanding of the facts,"" FedEx said in a statement. Tensions between FedEx and Chinese authorities have escalated as the larger US-China trade war drags on. The company has also been caught up in the conflict between pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong and the Chinese government. The Chinese government began investigating FedEx in June when Chinese tech company Huawei said FedEx diverted two packages to the United States that were meant for Huawei's headquarters in China. The following month, Chinese authorities claimed FedEx was holding back more than 100 packages meant for Huawei. FedEx later sued the US government over export restrictions on Huawei, saying they put FedEx in a vulnerable position. More recently, Chinese authorities opened another investigation into the company for allegedly shipping a parcel of knives to Hong Kong. In the wake of the Hong Kong protests, which have become increasingly violent and are now going on 15 weeks, Chinese authorities have ramped up security at travel checkpoints between the city and mainland China. According to the Journal, Hohn was arrested shortly before trying to board a flight with Cathay Dragon, a subsidiary of Cathay Pacific. Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's largest airline, has been under intense scrutiny from the Chinese government, leading to the resignation of its CEO Rupert Hogg."	CNN
73	https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/18/business/hong-kong-horse-races-canceled/index.html	Updated 6:15 AM ET, Wed September 18, 2019	Hong Kong horse races canceled over fears of political unrest	"Hong Kong (CNN Business)Fears of political unrest have forced the cancellation of one of Hong Kong's biggest money makers: The city's weekly horse races. The Hong Kong Jockey Club, which holds a government-granted monopoly on gambling, said it was canceling its weekly races on Wednesday because of an ""imminent threat"" to the safety of racegoers, jockeys and employees. The Jockey Club says it is the largest single taxpayer in Hong Kong. According to the organization's website, it contributes 16.3 billion Hong Kong dollars ($2.1 billion), or 1.3%, to the gambling-mad territory's GDP. ""Our concerns are tied to potential social unrest in the vicinity tonight, the very real threat of a disturbance or possible violence at Happy Valley Racecourse, and uncertainty regarding transportation in and around"" the area, a Jockey Club spokesperson said. Protestors had earlier threatened to disrupt Wednesday's races, a night set to feature a horse belonging to pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho. It is the latest blow to Hong Kong's economy linked to a political crisis that has lasted for months. Pro-democracy protestors in the city have taken to the streets for 15 straight weekends. The unrest has dragged on other sectors of Hong Kong's economy, including the city's restaurant and hotel industry. The international airport was also briefly shut down last month. The Jockey Club, meanwhile, contributes about 13 billion Hong Kong dollars ($1.7 billion) a year to public revenue through direct and indirect taxes. ""Its contribution to the GDP is over half that of the restaurant and hotel industry and about two-thirds that of the communications industry,"" the Jockey Club states on its website. Horse race betting at the Jockey Club totaled more than 125 billion Hong Kong dollars ($16 billion) for the fiscal year that ended in June, according to the organization's annual report. Betting turnover on races from last Wednesday came in at 1.1 billion Hong Kong dollars ($140 million), according to the Jockey Club. This Wednesday is also the first time since Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 that a race has been canceled because of social and political unrest. ""The cancellation of the race meeting tonight is based on concern about public safety,"" the Jockey Club said in a statement. ""Financial aspect is not a consideration. In fact, there will be a replacement meeting later."" The organization said bets made on Wednesday night's races will be refunded. The Hong Kong protests were originally sparked by a controversial bill that would allow extradition to China, but has since grown to include demands for more democracy and an independent investigation into alleged police brutality against protesters. The city's economy was already under pressure from the US-China trade war and slowing consumption in China. The government announced last month that it is pumping billions of dollars into its economy to avert a recession."	CNN
74	https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/15/asia/hong-kong-protest-violence-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 2:25 AM ET, Wed September 18, 2019	Hong Kong protests are growing smaller but more violent and ugly	"Hong Kong (CNN)Dozens of people were injured Sunday in another night of violence in Hong Kong, as the city marked its fifteenth consecutive weekend of anti-government protests. Thousands of people took part in a peaceful -- albeit unauthorized -- march from Causeway Bay to government offices in Admiralty, calling for the government to respond to the protest movement's five demands. That quickly turned violent after radical protesters gathered outside the legislature and began throwing bricks and petrol bombs at police lines. Police responded with tear gas and water cannon, using jets of blue dye for the second time. The dye -- which is also laced with tear gas -- is designed to indelibly mark protesters and make them easy to arrest later. The heavy response drove protesters back from the legislature and began a night of cat-and-mouse pursuit throughout the city, which saw protesters set fires and vandalize subway stations as police made sporadic arrests. At least 28 people were injured Sunday, according to the hospital authority. Of those, 13 men and four women have been discharged as of Monday morning, while 11 remain in hospital. Two men are in a ""serious condition,"" the authority said. While the violence between police and protesters was fairly regular compared to previous weeks, the ugliest scenes occurred at the edges of the protests, where both protester and pro-government groups attacked people who disagreed with them. CNN reporters saw a mob of masked protesters attacking a man in the Tin Hau neighborhood after a brief confrontation, leaving him dazed and bleeding on the floor. In an earlier incident, video shared widely online showed a middle-aged man wearing a blue shirt attacked and left apparently unconscious by a large group of mostly young, black-clad protesters on Gloucester Road. According to the South China Morning Post, the unidentified man had shouted pro-police slogans before the attack. Later on Sunday, a group of mostly middle-aged men were seen striking and threatening protesters in the North Point area. The area has a large mainland Chinese immigrant population, and there have been attacks on protesters in the area in past weeks. Sunday's violence came after a number of angry scuffles on Saturday between pro and anti-government groups, though none reached the level of violence seen the following day. Pro-Beijing groups sang the Chinese national anthem and pulled down ""Lennon Walls,"" collections of notes and flyers erected by protesters, around the city. In a Facebook post on Friday, pro-government lawmaker Junius Ho called on patriotic Hong Kongers to ""get together and clean Hong Kong."" Ho described it to CNN as an ""environmental hygiene campaign"" and said he ""would not urge any confrontation"" with protesters. Separately, Ho was involved in a controversy in July after he was filmed shaking hands with alleged triads who attacked protesters in Yuen Long. At a press conference later, he said the men were ""defending their home and people."" Ho told CNN that he met the men before any violence occurred and said he condemned any violence or lawbreaking. Following that incident, Ho appeared to threaten to kill opponents in a Facebook video, after a confrontation with pro-democratic lawmaker Eddie Chu on a talk show. Ho said that his words were ""taken out of context"" and not meant literally, nor was it his intention ""to encourage any crime."" This story has been updated to include comments from Junius Ho."	CNN
75	https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/12/asia/taiwan-hong-kong-china-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 3:44 AM ET, Thu September 12, 2019	Taiwan warns citizens not to travel to Hong Kong and China after businessman detained	"Hong Kong (CNN)Taiwan's ruling party has warned citizens against traveling to Hong Kong or mainland China, saying the situation is ""severe,"" after a Taiwanese businessman was detained following a visit to the protest-wracked city. Lee Meng-chu, 43, disappeared after he crossed over the border from Hong Kong to the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen on August 19. He was reported missing by a friend, Chen Ya-lin, who was supposed to meet him at Jakarta airport two days later. Chen said Lee had attended a protest in Hong Kong before crossing the border. On Wednesday a spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office confirmed that Lee was being questioned for ""criminal activities that could jeopardize China's national security."" The spokesman did not elaborate on the specific accusations against Lee. Hsueh Cheng-yi, a spokeswoman for Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said that the detention had led to fears in Taiwan over the safety of travelers heading to Hong Kong or mainland China. ""The situation inside Hong Kong and China is severe and travel should be reduced. If you have to go to these areas, you must pay close attention to your own safety, and keep your friends and relatives informed of your whereabouts,"" Hsueh said in a statement. Taiwan has been self-ruled since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, which saw the Communist Party take control of the mainland and the Nationalist government forced to flee to the island. Since then, as Taiwan has transitioned from one-party rule to democracy, Beijing has not given up on one day taking control the island. Cross-strait tensions have only worsened since the Hong Kong protests began in June, sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill between Hong Kong and mainland China. Officials said the law was originally designed to plug a loophole and allow Hong Kong to extradite an accused murderer to Taiwan, but early on Taipei said it would not cooperate with a law that risked its citizens in the city being sent to China. Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has also spoken out strongly in support of the protesters, even saying she would consider asylum requests from demonstrators. There is no indication at this stage whether Lee's detention was related to his attendance at the August 18 protest. According to his friend Chen, Lee was the director of the United Nations Association for the Advancement of Taiwan, an organization which advocates for the entry of Taiwan into the UN. But Chen said that despite his political activism, Lee had no ""hard feelings"" towards China and wasn't a vocal critic of the Chinese government or the Communist Party. Lee regularly traveled to China a number of times a year for his business, Chen added. Lee's family said he was not a threat to Beijing and called for the Chinese government to explain his detention. In a statement, they said Lee was ""just an ordinary person."" "	CNN
76	https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/10/asia/carrie-lam-hong-kong-us-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 9:05 AM ET, Tue September 10, 2019	Hong Kong's leader warns US and other countries not to interfere in protests	"Hong Kong (CNN)Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has warned the United States and other countries against interfering in the city's domestic affairs, two days after thousands of protesters gathered outside the US consulate to ask President Donald Trump to ""liberate"" the city. Lam said Tuesday it would be ""totally unacceptable"" for Washington or any other country to intervene in the semi-autonomous Chinese region. ""The Hong Kong government completely disagrees and expresses deep regret that foreign parliaments are interfering in our internal affairs through legislation,"" she said during her weekly news conference. ""We will never allow them to be stakeholders in Hong Kong's internal affairs."" The Hong Kong protests entered their 14th consecutive week on Sunday. Tens of thousands marched through the city's financial district and submitted a letter to officials of the US consulate, urging for greater action to help the protesters. The protests largely started off peacefully but violence has escalated as the summer has dragged on. On Sunday, many of the protesters expressed support for the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, which calls upon the US government to take a host of steps if Hong Kong does not ""remain sufficiently autonomous from the People's Republic of China."" Lam was asked Tuesday about the possibility that the US Congress might pass the bill, which could affect trade relations between the city and the US. She said some 1,400 US companies in Hong Kong currently benefit from Washington's relationship with the city and that ""any particular provisions applied to Hong Kong by the Americans are not exclusively for the benefit of Hong Kong."" A potential passing of the bill could further damage the city's economy. The US-China trade war, coupled with months of unrest, has already slowed down businesses and forced restaurants to lay off workers. The bill currently enjoys bipartisan support in Congress. ""Democrats and Republicans continue to stand united with the people of Hong Kong in demanding the hopeful, free and democratic future that is their right,"" US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last week. Hong Kong maintains a separate political, legal and economic system from the China due to a ""one country, two systems"" framework that was agreed when the territory was handed over by the United Kingdom to China in 1997. 'Violence cannot solve the issues' Lam on Tuesday also called on the public to stop resorting to violence, while stressing that she remains sincere in her desire to work with the public to resolve the current political deadlock. ""Escalation and continuation of violence cannot solve the issues faced by our society now. It will only deepen the conflict, contradiction, splits, and even hatred in society,"" she said. ""To mend the society and to bring back peace, we are very willing to engage people directly in a dialogue."" Hong Kong's protests started as a single-issue campaign against the controversial extradition bill, but have now grown to include other demands as weeks went by. Among their demands is the introduction of universal suffrage. Many protesters do not trust Lam, who announced plans to withdraw the bill last week after weeks of unrest, but stopped short of giving ground on other demands. Many protesters have said they would continue to take to the streets until all their demands are met. On Sunday, protesters could be heard chanting, ""Five demands, not one less."" "	CNN
77	https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/06/perspectives/hong-kong-protest-downturn/index.html	Updated 9:33 AM ET, Mon September 9, 2019	Be wary, investors: the Hong Kong protests still threaten world markets	Bill Campbell is co-portfolio manager of the DoubleLine Global Bond Strategy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. News that Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has formally withdrawn the extradition legislation that sparked mass protests in the territory must be viewed with caution. The aims of the 13-week long protest movement in the territory have broadened beyond opposition to the extradition bill to include a push for democratic reform and investigations into police brutality. While Lam's concession removed the original cause of the protests, the turmoil has already inflicted serious damage to Hong Kong's economy. Hong Kong's Census and Statistics Department reported that GDP contracted 0.4% in the second quarter. If the societal upheaval continues, economic slowdown in the territory will likely weigh on the broader Asian economy, with wider fallout for Asia's trading partners worldwide. While dwarfed by the economic output of the United States and China, Hong Kong is a critical hub for global trade and finance. It was the world's seventh-largest exporter of merchandise in 2017, according to the World Trade Organization. It is also the third leading global financial center, after New York and London, according to the Global Financial Centre Index. According to a triennial survey conducted by the Bank for International Settlements, Hong Kong with $437 billion in FX transactions in 2016 was the second-largest foreign exchange market in Asia and the fourth largest in the world that year. Civil unrest, if it persists, will represent a systemic stress point for global commerce, which has already been weakened by the US-China trade dispute. Ongoing economic disruption in the territory would not be confined to China and other parts of Asia but would also extend to the rest of the world, including Germany and the United States. In a rare display of bipartisan consensus, Republican and Democratic leaders in the United States have taken notice. In August, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell publicly threatened to have the Senate reconsider the 1992 Hong Kong Policy Act. This law gives Hong Kong preferential treatment in matters of trade and economics compared with mainland China by treating Hong Kong as a separate jurisdiction. In June, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement calling for a review of US-Hong Kong trade ties over the extradition bill. Areas of special treatment include visas, passports, law enforcement, permitted trade in sensitive technologies, customs designations and investment. The law also has meant trade between the United States and Hong Kong is not subject to the tariffs Washington imposes on China. Lam's withdrawal of the extradition bill should reduce the political risk to the Hong Kong Policy Act. But ongoing civil unrest in Hong Kong could rekindle proposals in Washington to undo it. Such a scenario would have ramifications far beyond Asia. International businesses and investors with activities in Hong Kong or in mainland China via Hong Kong would have to reassess those exposures if the Hong Kong Policy Act were to come under renewed scrutiny. Hong Kong provides a significant source of funds for mainland Chinese firms by serving as a conduit for foreign investors. Examples include the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock and Bond Connect programs that provide international investors with a gateway to purchase local Chinese stocks and bonds by reducing regulatory paperwork for foreign investment in Chinese securities. These programs show the continued importance of Hong Kong as a channel for opening Chinese capital markets. In addition, about 70% of the world's 100 largest banks operate within Hong Kong's borders, according to the Hong Kong Financial Services Development Council in a May 2018 report. Further deterioration in the political situation risks triggering capital flight that would threaten the territory's role as a global financial intermediary. Individuals may move their assets abroad, and international investors and businesses may remove money from the territory to avoid a stronger Chinese presence in the region. Given its importance as a hub for global trade and finance, Hong Kong is integral to the global economy. At a time when global trade and manufacturing are slowing amid the trade war between Washington and Beijing, these sectors are ill-equipped to handle the shock of an economic slowdown in Hong Kong or a change to its status as a trade and financial hub for the region. Investors should keep a close eye on the economic, as well as political developments in Hong Kong. The impact from reduced activity in this important region will only add to the headwinds blowing against the global economy and markets. 	CNN

Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Afghanistan war Peace talks to end the longest war in US history are in doubt now, after President Trump said he called off a secret meeting with Taliban leaders. The meeting was supposed to have been over the weekend at Camp David, but the President tweeted that he canceled it after the Taliban took credit for an attack in Kabul that killed a dozen people, including a US soldier. Inviting Taliban leaders onto US soil is an unprecedented move -- especially coming just days before the 9/11 anniversary -- and the invite drew criticism from lawmakers, including some Republicans. But CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen said the proposed deal the peace talks had produced is a bad one and that Trump was right to call off the meeting. 2. Bahamas A week after Hurricane Dorian, people in the northern Bahamas face an uncertain future. About 70,000 people on Grand Bahama and Abaco islands were left homeless by the storm. The death toll is 45 right now, but the government says that number will definitely rise. Search and recovery efforts have been slowed down by ravaged infrastructure as well as all of the piles of rubble and splintered homes that Dorian left behind. Many people are evacuating to the US, including some via cruise ships. But there was controversy over the weekend after a video emerged on social media that appeared to show Bahamians on a ferry bound for Fort Lauderdale, Florida, being told to get off the vessel if they were traveling to the US without a visa. More than 100 people got off the ferry at that point. Dorian, which is no longer a hurricane, has finally moved out to sea, after it tore across Canada's Atlantic coast over the weekend. About 215,968 customers are without power this morning in Nova Scotia. Click here to see photos and to find out how to help the victims. 3. Hong Kong protests Anti-government demonstrators in Hong Kong focused their attention on the US in this weekend's protests. Tens of thousands of protesters waved US flags and marched on the US Consulate in Hong Kong in a bid to get help from the Trump administration. Some marchers sang the US national anthem, while others carried banners, including one that read ""President Trump, please liberate Hong Kong."" The peaceful protests later deteriorated into violence and vandalism, with some marchers setting fire to a barricade outside a subway station entrance, smashing windows and spraying graffiti. Demonstrators have been holding protests in Hong Kong since June, calling for greater democracy and civil rights. 4. British Airways If you have a British Airways flight booked, you might need to make some alternate arrangements. The airline canceled almost all of its flights for today and tomorrow after the British pilots union went on strike. British Airways said it was forced to scrub so many flights because the union hadn't informed it of which pilots would be striking. The airline and union have been locked in a bitter dispute over pay. 5. Cargo ship overturns Four crew members from a cargo ship are missing after it overturned off the coast of Georgia.

79	https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/08/asia/hong-kong-us-protests-0809-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 9:41 PM ET, Sun September 8, 2019	Hong Kong protesters march to US Consulate to call for help from Trump	"Hong Kong (CNN)Protests calling on US President Donald Trump to intervene in the ongoing Hong Kong political standoff escalated rapidly Sunday, with marchers setting fire to a barricade outside a subway station entrance in the city's business district. Earlier in the day, tens of thousands of protesters waving US flags marched on Hong Kong's US Consulate to call for help from the Trump administration in ending a three-month confrontation with the government. The march began in the Chater Garden public park in Central before heading to the consulate as part of the 14th straight weekend of public demonstrations in the Asian financial hub. In a letter which protesters planned to presented to consulate officials, the group calls for the passing of the proposed ""Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019"" by the US Congress. One banner carried at the march read ""President Trump, please liberate Hong Kong"" in English. Some marchers sang the US national anthem as they moved towards the consulate. ""We share the same US values of liberty and democracy,"" 30-year-old banker David Wong said. ""USA is a country of democracy. Donald Trump is elected by his people. We want this."" The protests began peacefully but rapidly deteriorated into violence and vandalism over the afternoon, after police appeared to arrest a number of people in the busy Central subway station. Protesters erected a barricade at one of the subway exits before being setting it on fire. Other exits had their glass windows smashed or defaced with graffiti. The Sunday clashes indicate that an attempt by the Hong Kong government to defuse the crisis by withdrawing a controversial China extradition bill on Wednesday, one of the official five demands of the protest movement, had failed. Leading activists said the move was too little too late and already on Sunday groups of protesters have been heard chanting, ""Five demands, not one less."" The march is unlikely to end allegations by the Chinese government and state-run media that the United States has been interfering in the Hong Kong protests. Speaking last week, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office spokesman Yang Guang accused US politicians of ""shooting their mouths off"" on the demonstrations. 'Most favored nation' status US President Donald Trump has shown little inclination to get involved in the Hong Kong protests since they began in June. In August he said he hoped the demonstrations would eventually work out ""for everybody, including China"" and that no one gets hurt. But some US politicians have been pushing for greater US action to help the protesters, with some even pushing for an official re-evaluation of Hong Kong's ""most-favored-nation"" trade status with the United States. That special status gives countries certain trade advantages, including lower tariffs on imported goods, according to the US government. A bipartisan group of US senators introduced the ""Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act"" in June, which requires an annual check that Hong Kong is autonomous enough ""to justify special treatment."" It's this act which some protesters are calling on the US Congress to pass to put additional pressure on the Hong Kong government and Beijing to accede to their demands. The interest US politicians have shown in Hong Kong, including Vice President Mike Pence and the Democrat Party leadership, have led to accusations from China that Washington is behind the three-month long demonstrations. ""It is an open secret in Hong Kong that the forces protesting the extradition bill have been sponsored by the US,"" Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times said in an editorial in July. Multiple high-ranking Chinese Foreign Ministry officials have repeated the claim without any proof. The US State Department responded that Chinese claims of their involvement are ""ridiculous."" Months of protest chaos Protest organizers say millions of people have taken to the streets of Hong Kong since early June, in protests which evolved from objections to the planned extradition bill into wider calls for greater democracy and civil rights. Currently the protest movement has five demands, including an investigation into allegations of police brutality and the release of arrested demonstrators. On Wednesday, Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced one of the protesters' demands would be met by withdrawing the extradition bill from the local parliament. But so far the government has refused to meet any of the other demands. Despite the withdrawal by Lam, there have been clashes between police and protesters every night in the past week. Much of the action has focused on the streets around Prince Edward subway station, in the residential and commercial hub of Mong Kok, where video from Sunday night showed police officers chasing down and forcefully arresting protesters. Demonstrators at Sunday's march said that they're not going to back down until all their demands are met. ""It's just like going to work,"" 64-year-old protester Felix Wu said, laughing. "	CNN
80	https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/05/asia/hong-kong-student-protests-school-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 9:58 PM ET, Thu September 5, 2019	After a summer of being tear gassed, can Hong Kong protesters go back to being students?	"(CNN)Welcome signs, colorful banners and campus maps are plastered over Hong Kong's colleges and high schools. It's the first week of school, but there's one problem -- thousands of students are missing from the classrooms. At 10 of the city's 13 universities, students are staging a class boycott, and student union leaders estimate that more than 100 secondary schools also planned class strikes. It's the latest move in pro-democracy protests that have rocked Hong Kong for the past three months, and the students say it will continue until the government responds to all of their five core demands. So far, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has acquiesced to one: the full withdrawal of the bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China, and which sparked the protests in June. While the demonstrations have spanned all demographics, young people have become the face of the movement, and some have been at the most violent, extreme end of the clashes. More than 1,100 protesters have been arrested this summer -- one 13-year-old was arrested for being in possession of two petrol bombs, police say. Now students are going through the motions of starting a new school year, buying books and registering for classes. It's a familiar routine, but nothing about it feels normal. ""The city is dying,"" said Kris Fan, a 17-year-old high-school student. ""We can't just sit here and read our books. That's no use. I think the city is more important than our academics."" After a summer holiday defined by tear gas, political activism, and the worst political crisis Hong Kong has seen in decades, many young people say they simply can't return to normal student life. One summer can change everything When 21-year-old Davin Kenneth Wong watched the science fiction television show ""Stranger Things"" with his friends last month, he was struck by its parallels with his own life. In the Netflix show, a band of rebellious kids (plus one with superpowers) do battle against otherworldly monsters to save their hometown. ""One summer can change everything,"" the trailer said. ""We totally feel that,"" said Wong, president of Hong Kong University's Student Union (HKUSU). ""This summer really changed everything. We were fighting real-life 'Stranger Things' -- but instead of fighting something from another dimension, we're fighting the police."" Usually, students spend their summers hanging out with their friends, going to the beach, and resting up. Instead, this summer they transformed into seasoned protest veterans, strapping on gas masks and hard hats. Student unions helped from the sidelines, encouraging students to attend large rallies. Hong Kong University's union also engaged lawyers to provide assistance to arrested students, Wong said. Law students offered protesters legal advice, and medical undergrads volunteered as frontline medics. In some ways, we've seen this before -- student activism has a long history in Hong Kong. In 1989, thousands of the city's college and high school students staged rallies to support students protesting in Beijing's Tiananmen Square before the crackdown. The Hong Kong Federation of Students, a cross-college students' union, held fundraisers in support of their mainland counterparts' fight for democracy. Students struck again in 2003 and 2012, blocking legislation they felt gave Beijing too much power. But Hong Kong's young people were truly catapulted onto the global stage during the 2014 Umbrella Revolution. Protest figureheads like Joshua Wong, then just 17 years old, were depicted worldwide as teenage revolutionaries. The 2014 movement ultimately failed, with the electoral system remaining uchanged. Some of its most high-profile figures, including former student leaders Nathan Law and Sixtus ""Baggio"" Leung, ran for office and won legislative seats -- but they were disqualified in a heated controversy in 2017. The tensions of that failed movement have reemerged this summer -- but this time, the students have learned from the lessons of 2014. There is no central figure with star power. Their movement is leaderless, fluid, and democratic, as well as darker and more nihilistic. Protesters began masking their faces as the violence ramped up this summer. Recent weeks have seen young people setting large fires in the street and throwing petrol bombs at riot police, who respond with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons. The escalation in violence stems from feelings of desperation, as Hong Kong's young people feel like time is running out in their fight for democracy. The semi-autonomous city currently enjoys certain freedoms and its own legal system under an agreement between former colonial power Britain and China. That 1997 deal ends in 2047, when Hong Kong will be likely absorbed into Xi Jinping's authoritarian China. The fear around that deadline is evident in the protesters' rhetoric. Posters around the city and on campuses read, ""If we burn, you burn with us,"" and ""Give me democracy or give me death."" ""We're losing,"" said Fan. ""We're losing things like freedom of press, freedom without fear. We're just fighting for what we have now."" Model students no more Families in Hong Kong have typically heavily emphasized educational achievement, and students are often laser-focused on getting stellar grades. The idea that students would skip school was practically inconceivable. But for many, priorities have shifted this summer, and many say schoolwork now feels trivial when the city's future is at stake. ""(Over) the past few months, so many things happened that society has become unstable, and we're all uncertain about what's going to happen in the very near future,"" said Joey Siu, a student union executive member at the City University of Hong Kong. Now, she said, ""we don't mind sacrificing our school life to spend time on protecting our homeland."" Meanwhile, high school students like Fan and 17-year-old Charlotte Chan have to sit the Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE) exam this year, which is used for college admissions. They're worried about the rigorous exam, and say they'll study for it -- but they aren't willing to let go of the protests. ""This is our future -- if we just focus on our academic results and neglect our society, I think I will regret it when I'm older,"" said Chan. Even for those who aren't boycotting, things feel and look different. There are empty classroom seats and political conversations in hallways. Nearly every campus has a so-called Lennon Wall, a mosaic of Post-it Notes bearing protest messages, as well as posters of protest art. At City University, a replica statue of the Goddess of Democracy, which was originally created for the Tiananmen Square protests, is covered in cracks. It was vandalized during the height of the Hong Kong protests, allegedly by a mainland Chinese student, and has been painstakingly glued back together. It's a fitting image -- students on the front lines have had their sense of normality shattered and lives forever changed. Chan had previously wanted to pursue a career in journalism or marketing, but is now planning to study government and public administration in college. ""If I really take part in the government, maybe I have larger power to change the whole thing,"" she said. Others say they can never go back to being regular kids, the way they were before the protests. ""I can't give back my knowledge of tear gas and rubber bullets,"" said Wong, the HKU student leader. ""It's here, and it will always be here. I don't want this kind of knowledge, and I don't want these memories."" Sometimes he ""fantasizes"" about returning to a normal, carefree life -- but moving on before the crisis has been resolved would be ""to ignore what has happened."" ""We can't just let this go,"" he said. Tension in the air with students back on campus Not every student supports the protests. And while it might have been easier for students on opposing sides to ignore each other over the summer, now they will sit close by in class and work together on school projects. Nearly every student CNN spoke to believed there would be some friction between those who support the protests, and those who back the police and government. Fan admitted there will likely be some bullying directed at pro-police students -- if not ostracization. Earlier this summer, Chan said one classmate posted a video online lambasting her school and its students for supporting the protests. ""She went back to school after the video and people discussed her in corners, saying, 'That's the person,'"" Chan said. ""We won't argue face to face, but just act like we're not seeing her."" Chinese students from the mainland are also worried. Several who spoke to CNN said they were nervous returning to campus with such widespread anti-China sentiment. One mainland student was warned by her friends to avoid speaking Mandarin in public. The protests are, in many ways, a direct statement of defiance against Beijing. Protest signs often read ""HK is not China."" At a pro-Hong Kong democracy rally at Australia's University of Queensland, clashes broke out between pro-Hong Kong protesters and mainland Chinese counter-protesters, who blasted the Chinese national anthem on a loudspeaker. Meanwhile, Beijing's rhetoric has become increasingly tough on the situation, moving from calling the protesters ""rioters"" to saying their actions showed ""signs of terrorism."" State media agency Xinhua warned in a recent commentary that ""the end is coming for those attempting to disrupt Hong Kong and antagonize China."" These Hong Kong-mainland hostilities aren't new on campuses. Even before the protests began, mainland and local students tended to stay separate, said Siu, the City University student union leader. Siu added that each year a handful of mainland students try to tear down posters critical of the Chinese government. However, most high school and college students CNN spoke to advocated for keeping their campuses as safe spaces for intellectual discussion, where they can be exposed to different perspectives. ""If people support the police, we need to ask why, because maybe we as protesters have also done violent things,"" said Fan. ""We need to open up ourselves to talk to them, rather than just scold them."" School administrations have generally tried to stay neutral. Most universities, such as HKU, Chinese University of Hong Kong, and Lingnan University, have not threatened any action for students who are boycotting -- although they have warned that missing class could hurt students' attendance records and grades. Sometimes classroom policies are decided by the professors. King-wa Fu, an associate professor of journalism and media studies at HKU, plans to audio-record lectures and put them online for students -- a new measure this year. ""I wrote to assure the students their freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are fully respected, but there is their responsibility to catch up with the class progress no matter you miss any class or not,"" Fu said. Hong Kong's Education Bureau, which oversees all education levels, has taken the harshest stance so far, condemning the boycott and asking parents to ""dissuade"" their children from joining in a letter sent on August 29. ""Schools should never be used for expressing political demands, and more importantly, minors should not be involved as the move could bring them emotional disturbances and undermine school harmony,"" said the letter, signed by Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung. It further urged parents to advise their children against ""taking part in dangerous or illegal activities."" For some students, neutrality is not enough. Wong and Siu are trying to convince their respective university leaders to offer support for the striking students with measures like waiving attendance records or providing recorded lectures, as Fu has done. ""I think this is the minimum the university can and should do,"" Wong said. Where do we go from here? University boycott organizers say they are issuing a two-week deadline for the government to respond to their demands, before they consider further escalation. For now, they're still going to campus -- but instead of attending classes, they're holding their own events and makeshift lectures, with guest speakers and panel discussions on the unrest. Meanwhile, Lam has made clear that she and her administration will not be capitulating to the protesters' full five demands. ""In the last two months or so, the government has repeatedly given a reply to the demands from different people,"" she said at a press conference on August 27, addressing accusations of government inaction. ""It is not a question of not responding -- it is a question of not accepting those demands."" Both sides are digging their heels in, even as energy, patience, and time run short. ""We're not just physically exhausted, we're mentally exhausted,"" said Siu. It's not just the demonstrators who are run ragged -- business owners, police officers, journalists, and everyday citizens are weary after 13 straight weeks of protest. But as the student strike seems to signal, there is no clear end in sight. ""The reason for this movement to be so long lasting is because everyone is trying to think of something to do, to really meet our objective and get our aim,"" said Wong. ""We are trying any way possible we can think of just to get what we want, which is just freedom. Simply freedom."" "	CNN
81	https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/asia/hong-kong-protests-withdrawal-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 10:26 AM ET, Thu September 5, 2019	Hong Kong government's attempt to outflank protesters is doomed to fail	"Hong Kong (CNN)Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced Wednesday that she will finally withdraw the loathed extradition bill that kick-started three months of violent protests. The move was greeted not with the relief or happiness she might have hoped for, but with frustration and anger that the compromise had taken so long. Few expect the unrest to stop anytime soon. The government may hope to outflank the protest movement by painting them as unwilling to accept compromise, but even some of Lam's allies have publicly said that the withdrawal was too little, too late. Lam has walked right up to the line of an effective solution and stopped just short, just as she did in June when she suspended the bill instead of withdrawing it. Had she announced an independent investigation into allegations of police brutality -- thus fulfilling the two most important of the protests' five demands -- she might have taken the wind out of the movement. Instead, she continues to insist the matter be handled by the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC), which despite its name has been criticized as stacked with government loyalists and lacks the confidence of protesters. Speaking Wednesday, Michael Tien, a moderate pro-Beijing lawmaker, urged the government to set up an independent inquiry, which was ""absolutely necessary to quell the conflicts and for Hong Kong to heal."" ""I absolutely believe an independent inquiry is of utmost importance,"" he said. ""The withdrawal of the bill ... may be too late because this movement has become more than the bill."" Starry Lee, leader of the largest pro-Beijing party, said of Lam's withdrawal: ""We think it's late, but it's important for someone to take the first step. Whether this will stop the movement, it depends on the society."" Too little, too late? For weeks, the government has been insisting -- as protests became more and more violent and the city's economy stumbled -- that the suspension of the bill in June was as good as withdrawal, that it was dead and done and protesters should take the concession and go home. Now, in week 13, protesters have shown skepticism of her decision now to withdraw the bill ""to fully allay public concerns."" While their demands have expanded over the course of this summer of discontent, withdrawal has always been their number one appeal. ""If Carrie Lam had withdrawn the bill two months ago, it would have been a quick fix,"" one protester said at a press conference following Lam's announcement. ""We have one demand down and four to go. We won't settle for less."" Pro-government lawmakers and members of Lam's cabinet have long said they supported withdrawing the bill. If as some reports have suggested, Lam genuinely changed her view after meetings with various youth and business groups demonstrated how much public opinion was in favor of withdrawal, then this only reinforces a perception of her as out of touch. Online, some protesters joked that Lam was always late, comparing her to a shoddy internet browser that takes forever to load a page. Others saw something more sinister in the decision, saying it was an attempt to buy time or a few weeks of peace ahead of October 1, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a celebration Beijing will not want overshadowed by Hong Kong protests. No one seemed willing to accept the withdrawal as a victory. Protest groups are continuing to organize student strikes, rallies and a renewed targeting of the city's airport, the focus of several recent major protests. Fernando Cheung, a pro-democracy lawmaker, said that despite the withdrawal, Lam ""is not doing her job, she is not answering the people's demands, and not in a timely manner."" He predicted the protests will continue. ""I don't think anybody wants more violence"" but given the situation ""people are willing to risk their lives for the future of Hong Kong."" What happens next? In Beijing, there is a ready audience for portrayals of protesters as unwilling to compromise. Speaking earlier this week, Yang Guang, spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of China's State Council, said the situation in the city was ""complex and grim"" and accused protesters of seeking to split Hong Kong from China and create a base for anti-Communist Party activities. ""Participating in peaceful marches and gatherings is totally different to those who unscrupulously challenge the 'one country, two systems' bottom line ... deface and insult the national flag, violently attack police and innocent citizens, seriously damage public and private property and endanger public safety,"" Yang said. Most Chinese state media downplayed Lam's decision Wednesday, while the nationalist tabloid Global Times -- which has claimed without evidence the protests are foreign-led -- said the extradition bill ""has been used by radicals as an excuse to start violent protests."" ""Though the move is meant to show the (Hong Kong) government's sincerity in addressing the political crisis, it should not be seen as a concession by Lam that could lead to a slippery slope, and radical forces should not have any illusion of winning ground on matters related to the 'one country, two systems' principle that governs Hong Kong and China's sovereignty,"" the paper said. Throughout the protests, both the Hong Kong and Beijing governments have appeared to prefer sticks to carrots, putting huge pressure on the city's police to control the unrest, with increasing use of force as protesters adopted more violent tactics. Now that Lam has given a minor concession, one that few expect to be enough, attention will be on whether she looks to a larger stick."	CNN

Hong Kong protests As Hong Kong gears up for its 13th straight weekend of mass protests, some of its highest profile pro-democracy leaders are in jail. Joshua Wong, who led massive protests in 2014, and activist Agnes Chow were among those arrested this morning in Hong Kong. Anti-government activist Andy Chan was arrested last night at Hong Kong's airport. They were charged with offenses, including organizing an unauthorized assembly, obstructing police and suspicion of rioting. The arrests could inflame already heightened tensions before this next planned round of demonstrations. Protesters have been calling for full withdrawal of an extradition bill, an independent inquiry into police brutality and universal voting rights in Hong Kong. 3. Amazon rainforest fires For the next 60 days, the use of fire to clear land in Brazil is banned. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro enacted the ban this week in response to the massive fires that have raged through the Amazon rainforest there. Burning land in rural areas is a common practice among Brazilian farmers, who often use fires to clear land for new crops or livestock. Bolsonaro wants the Amazon opened up to development, so a lot of experts point the finger at his pro-development policies and lax regulation as the reason ranchers and farmers are burning the rainforest. 4. Border wall Looks like the Trump administration is all set to start using military construction funds to begin building the President's wall on the US-Mexico border. Trump used an emergency declaration in February to justify using military money. That's faced stiff legal challenges, but the Supreme Court last month OK'd the use of $2.5 billion in counter-drug funding from the Defense Department to start building parts of the wall while the rest of the legal battle plays out in court. It's unclear when the Pentagon would start to shift the funds to wall construction, but White House officials have ramped up talks in the last couple weeks to start planning for it. 5. Economy Asian markets followed Wall Street's lead and rallied today, buoyed by some positive talk from China on the trade war. It wasn't much -- just China's commerce ministry saying the country can reach a resolution on the trade dispute with the US with a ""calm attitude."" But that was enough to spark some optimism. US stocks jumped 326 points yesterday. That's the best day for Wall Street in about two weeks. But the economic news wasn't all good.

83	https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/28/asia/hong-kong-china-crisis-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 1:19 AM ET, Wed August 28, 2019	China's top diplomat says Hong Kong protests are city's worst crisis since 1997	"Hong Kong (CNN)Hong Kong's ongoing protests are the city's biggest crisis in more than two decades of Chinese rule, a top Beijing official said Tuesday, following a weekend of violent clashes between protesters and police. In a meeting with Hong Kong business leaders in the Chinese capital, Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged them to ""hold high the banner of patriotism"" and work to help Hong Kong's government in ending the violence. He added that the central government was confident the city would overcome its current difficulties, according to reports in Chinese state media. His comments came after Sunday saw one of the most violent nights in the now three months of anti-government protests: A police officer fired his gun in the air as a warning to protesters who threatened to overwhelm him and his colleagues, and authorities deployed water cannon for the first time as protesters threw petrol bombs and bricks at police lines. On Sunday, commentary in Chinese state media appeared to signal Beijing was losing patience with protesters. The official news agency Xinhua said the central government had the ""authority"" and ""responsibility"" to intervene and prevent riots in Hong Kong -- reiterating comments made by former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw Hong Kong's handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997. While reiterating that effective negotiations cannot occur while violence is ongoing, the city's government this week made vague gestures towards reconciliation. On Monday, beleaguered Chief Executive Carrie Lam met with a panel of young people as part of ""starting a dialogue"" to work to end the unrest, now in its twelfth week. There remains little hope for full scale talks, however, after Lam indicated she has no intention of addressing any of the five demands put forward by protesters for weeks. They include the withdrawal of the now-suspended extradition bill that kicked off the whole crisis, an inquiry into police brutality and full universal suffrage for electing the city's legislature and leader. ""In the last two months or so, the government has repeatedly given a reply to the demands from different people,"" Lam said Tuesday. ""It is not a question of not responding, it is a question of not accepting those demands."" She again reiterated her government's line that the suspension of the extradition bill -- widely derided as insufficient and too late by protesters -- should be enough to end the unrest. ""If the bill was the cause of all these disruptions, that has been stopped over two months ago,"" Lam said. ""So we have to ask ourselves, the continued resort to violence and protests and harassment -- what are we going to do? If we continue to tolerate, accommodate and accept demands because of those protests, that will be a very inappropriate and unacceptable response from the government."" Protesters have repeatedly stated that their demands are clear and that they have no intention of talking if Lam's government will not meet at least some of them. Many have also raised the potential of arrest as a reason for not talking to Lam, fearing that anyone who puts themselves forward as a spokesperson for the leaderless movement could face prosecution later. Critics have also pointed to Lam's ongoing refusal to meet with opposition lawmakers, who make up around 35% of the city's semi-democratic legislature, as a reason to be skeptical about any future talks. Working towards a solution Pressure is growing on Lam to find some way out of the crisis, which has begun to severely impact the city's economy. A senior pro-government lawmaker who has been advising Lam, and requested anonymity to speak about ongoing discussions, said many legislators were ""frustrated"" that the government has missed multiple opportunities to defuse the crisis and had handled the situation ""poorly."" The lawmaker said they had urged the government to answer ""at least half of the demands"" put forward in the past 12 weeks, including a full withdrawal of the extradition bill which kickstarted the crisis and an independent investigation into allegations of police brutality. There needed to be ""deep rooted reforms"" in the wake of the protests, the lawmaker said, which had exposed major dissatisfaction and anger within Hong Kong society beyond initial alarm at the extradition bill. Beijing has consistently stated its support for Lam's government and her handling of the crisis. In an editorial following the Chief Executive's comments Tuesday, the state-run China Daily voiced approval for her hardline posture, while warning that the gap between Lam's position and that of the protesters ""appears to be unbridgeable."" ""Her administration will by no means swallow the pills the demonstrators prescribe, as it will directly shake the foundation of the 'one country, two systems' framework and threaten China's sovereignty over the city,"" the paper said. This weekend's violence followed widespread frustration at Lam's lackluster response to yet another peaceful mass demonstration which attracted hundreds of thousands of people on August 18, the first tear gas free protest in weeks. In her remarks Tuesday, Lam said that the violence would not derail talks, however. ""I am saying that, yes, we have to say no to violence,"" she said. ""We want to put an end to the chaotic situation in Hong Kong through law enforcement and so on. At the same time, we will not give up on building a platform for dialogue."" Caspar Wong, a former president of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University Student Union who was in the Monday meeting with Lam, praised it as ""quite an open dialogue atmosphere."" He said participants were critical of Lam and her administration, and in her closing remarks Lam ""said she clearly accepted all the comments."" ""As a starting point it was quite a useful meeting,"" he said, adding that he recommended ""that they cannot avoid the five demands"" and should work on meeting protesters in the middle, as well as launching a ""reconciliation committee"" to investigate the protests and allegations of violence on both sides.

84	https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/25/asia/hong-kong-protest-aug-25-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 5:52 AM ET, Mon August 26, 2019	A gun shot, petrol bombs and water cannons mark violent escalation in Hong Kong protests	"Hong Kong (CNN)A Hong Kong police officer fired a live shot into the air as protesters squared off against police armed with water cannons Sunday, in one of the most violent nights seen since mass pro-democracy protests began 12 weekends ago. Commentary in Chinese state media Sunday signaled that Beijing is losing patience with protesters. State-run media outlet Xinhua said the central government had the ""authority"" and ""responsibility"" to intervene and prevent riots in Hong Kong -- reiterating comments made by former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw Hong Kong's return to China from British rule under a dual governance setup, which gives the city a separate legal system with more democratic freedoms until 2047. Sunday's pro-democracy protests had begun peacefully. Thousands braved a thunderstorm to march from Kwai Chung to Tseun Wan district, in the city's New Territories. They showed up dressed in plastic ponchos and rain coats, and huddled under a sea of umbrellas. But the violence returned Sunday evening, when a smaller group of protesters broke away from the day's main police-approved march -- now a familiar feature of the protests. They used traffic cones and street railings to build makeshift barricades in the street, and threw bricks, metal poles, and petrol bombs at police. Twenty-one police officers were injured, police said Monday. Tear gas was initially deployed but failed to disperse the group. Later, a water cannon was used against a makeshift barricade, marking the first time water cannon vans had ever been used in the city. Protesters were pushed back, but again the crowd didn't disperse. As the violence escalated, six officers drew their pistols after being surrounded by armed protesters and one officer fired a live shot into the air, police said. The Hong Kong police said in a statement that the officers were ""surrounded, under attacks and facing threats to life"" and one officer fired ""a warning shot to the sky without any other choices."" In a statement, police said protesters' actions were ""outrageous and have overstepped the bottom line of a civilized society,"" and added that they ""will take relentless enforcement action to bring the persons involved to justice."" In total, 86 people were arrested over the weekend for unlawful assembly, including a 12-year-old boy and a 51-year-old. The 12-year-old's arrest highlights the presence of young children at some violent scenes of the protest movement, days before the school semester begins. A Hong Kong spokesperson told CNN that it is possible for the child to be charged under Hong Kong laws. Police said that arrestees' offenses on Sunday included unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapon and assaulting police officers. According to organizers on the messaging platform Telegram, the march was intended to reiterate protesters' core demands -- withdrawal of an extradition bill, the dropping of riot charges of those arrested, an independent inquiry into police and greater democratic reforms -- as well as express opposition to alleged police brutality. Week of calm shattered Violence also broke out Saturday, after thousands in the city's east Kwun Tong district marched for the movement's five demands, and against the government's installation of ""smart"" environmental monitoring lampposts, which have sparked privacy concerns. Demonstrators attempted to tear down or dismantle some of the city's 50 newly-installed so-called ""smart lampposts"" -- which have cameras and sensors -- in a protest against perceived government surveillance. The Hong Kong government said the lamp posts, which are intended to track data such as air quality and traffic flow, are not equipped with facial recognition software and ""would not infringe upon personal privacy."" Police arrested 32 people on Saturday -- 22 men and 10 women between the ages of 15 and 22 -- on suspicion of weapons possession, assault of police and unlawful assembly. The stand off brought an end to a week of relative calm in Hong Kong, which had seen numerous clashes between protesters and police since early summer. After tear gas was fired nearly every weekend in July, last weekend saw an estimated 1.7 million people brave the heavy rain and heat to march peacefully. The calm continued through the week, with protesters peacefully creating a human chain across the city on Friday -- the 30th anniversary of the Baltic Way human chain. However, senior police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said this week that officers had been targeted and exposed online even while there was temporary peace on the streets. The police said officers' personal data, contact information, home addresses and more had been shared online, and accused protesters of threatening officers' families. They called the doxxing tactic ""a kind of psychological war,"" and said they had arrested 16 people on suspicion of disclosing personal data without consent and causing harm, and unauthorized access to a computer. Families of police speak out A group of Hong Kong Police relatives held their own rally on Sunday, calling for a communication platform between the police and the public ""to mend the broken relationship,"" and asking the police to act ""with malice or ill-will toward none,"" according to a Facebook post by organizers. The group of about 400 attempted to deliver a letter to Chief Executive Carrie Lam, saying that their relatives in the police force should not be ""used as a shield"" and that Lam should ""settle the political issue with politics."" The group did not denigrate the protest movement, instead said that the police force were ""being pushed by political issues to confront the public."" ""Moreover, the mismanagement within the HKPF (Hong Kong Police Force ) and malpractices of some frontline police officers all caused the police-civilian relationship to fall into a tragic abyss."" Hong Kong has been protesting now for almost three months. It all began in June, sparked by a controversial bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China. Although the bill has since been suspended, protesters' demands have evolved and expanded to include Lam's resignation, the full withdrawal of the bill, and universal suffrage. Lam has condemned violence and pledged greater communication with the public, but many feel that's not enough: some protesters say they will continue demonstrating until she responds to their demands. The nonstop protests have taken a toll on everyone involved -- on Saturday, Lam had posted a lengthy statement on Facebook appealing for peace and dialogue. ""After more than two months, everyone is tired. Can we sit down and talk about it?"" she said, acknowledging that there were deeper societal problems beyond the immediate violence that needed to be addressed. Correction: A homepage headline referring to this story and posted briefly on Aug. 25 inaccurately said Hong Kong police had used petrol bombs. In fact, police deployed water cannons and drew guns; protestors threw petrol bombs. The inaccuracy was not reported in this article or on this article page. "	CNN
85	https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/25/opinions/call-him-king-trump-opinion-weekly-column-carr/index.html	Updated 10:34 AM ET, Sun August 25, 2019	Call him King Trump	"Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. (CNN)Something is rotten in the state of Denmark -- but the smell is coming from somewhere else. This week, after calling President Donald Trump's idea to purchase Greenland ""absurd,"" the Danish Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, joined the ranks of an exclusive but growing club of women, the one with people Trump calls ""nasty."" Its members? Latest count: a former Secretary of State, a current Speaker of the House, a handful of US Senators, the CEO of General Motors, the Duchess of Sussex. (There are also over a dozen guys, many of whom were running for president at the time of their induction.) As Frida Ghitis pointed out, ""nasty"" is ""one of the insults he [Trump] generally"" deploys when going after ""strong women."" Kara Alaimo concurred, suggesting that Trump's predilection for dismissing women who challenge him is an example of his troubling misogyny. In this case, Ghitis assessed, his disparagement of Frederiksen is also a sign of Trump's obsession with Scandinavia and the Nordic countries. ""There's just something about Trump and Scandinavia,"" she wrote, from Trump's false claim in ""The Art of the Deal"" that his grandfather was Swedish (he was German) to his plaintive question during the notorious meeting where he allegedly complained about people coming from ""shithole countries"": why don't more Norwegians want to come to the United States? With Trump handing out insults to world leaders and christening himself the ""chosen one"" (even though he later claimed he was kidding), the G7 meeting -- happening this weekend in Biarritz -- may be a spicy affair. A view on the G7 meeting: Michael Bociurkiw: Trump wants to welcome Russia back into G7. John McCain must be rolling in his grave The United States of America isn't the first country to endure an ""unhinged"" leader, observed John Avlon, but the nation may be facing a new threshold with Trump's triptych this week: making the ""chosen one"" comment, retweeting a conspiracy theorist who called him the ""second coming of God"" and joking about giving himself a Medal of Honor. ""There is no universe where the President approving of comparisons of himself to the Messiah is not strange and disturbing,"" Avlon declared. And after Trump leveled his rage at Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday and the markets tanked, the message was clear, said Avlon: ""President Trump seems to see himself as invested with the powers of a king, constrained only by the generosity of his will. Which is why he rails against any individual or institution who attempts to hold him accountable."" The President is ""seemingly devoted to making our country the Divided States of America"" wrote Michael D'Antonio, calling out as ""evil"" the words Trump used to describe American Jews who vote for Democrats: Trump said they have ""either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty."" Writing in the Los Angeles Times, Lev Golinkin noted that the ""disloyalty"" charge carries a dark and twisted history, one that invokes ""blood-soaked"" and ""historically lethal"" forms of anti-Semitism. Trump's comment was ""sickening coming from an American president,"" wrote Philip Klein for the Washington Examiner. More smart takes: Dean Obeidallah: Trump's hypocrisy on extremist groups Julian Zelizer: Under Trump, the deficit has ballooned, exploding a GOP myth Help us say goodbye to summer More opportunities to share your story: About leaving for college -- Marjorie Rosenthal: Having an empty nest isn't what I expected About the challenges of air travel -- Lori Bassani: What new FAA chief needs to do to keep the misery out of flying The deepest betrayal of America Against the backdrop of the documented rise of domestic extremism in the United States, another instance emerged this week of students appearing to use Nazi gestures -- this time in California. We must address this recurring problem of young people evoking a ""nightmarish past,"" wrote David Vigilante, with an understanding that white supremacy and Nazism, while directed at Jews and people of color, are a betrayal of every single one of us -- any expression of them harms us all. Vigilante urged readers to remember what's at stake in a Nazi (or Nazi-sympathizing) gesture, song, image or idea: ""To admire Nazism is to be a racist. To admire Nazism is to betray your country. And to admire Nazism is to torture the souls of those Americans who paid the ultimate price to save our democracy from the Nazis. That is how we all must see anyone who venerates Nazis."" Trump's empty promises on guns Trying to trace Trump's position on guns can feel like a trip through the looking glass. After the Parkland shooting in 2018, he pledged he would ""do something"" and, according to Democrats who attended meetings with him, he expressed openness to banning assault weapons and support for universal background checks. But after speaking with NRA leaders, those prospects evaporated. Enough is enough, emphasized Michael Dowling for CNN Business Perspectives, issuing a call for fellow health care CEOs to take a stand on gun control. Dowling outlined five immediate steps health care CEOs can take to mobilize employees, and called gun violence ""a national tragedy and a public health crisis that demands we use our political capital and advocacy. Health care CEOs and the 18 million men and women who are part of the nation's health care workforce can be an incredibly powerful voice for change."" Jennifer Rubin, writing in the Washington Post, identified another way of addressing the crisis: ""Practically speaking, the real way forward might be for Democrats to run on gun safety in 2020 and call out Trump and his Republican allies as cowards. That would be smart politics given that the NRA's approval is underwater and new gun laws are exceptionally popular with the same groups of voters already fleeing the GOP (e.g., women, college-educated voters, suburbanites)."" The immigration disaster Two crucial and controversial elements of the United States immigration system came under fire this week. The first -- the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) -- has been ""living on borrowed time"" ever since Trump first tried to end it in September 2017, wrote Elie Honig. But the ""skies are darkening"" for DACA, Honig said, as the Trump administration's effort to terminate the program -- backed this week by the Justice Department -- heads to the Supreme Court in its upcoming term. Honig speculated that on this issue, as on so many others, the deciding vote may rest with Chief Justice John Roberts. The Trump administration's message on immigration is clear, contended Raul Reyes: ""When all else fails, lock up children."" That's what Reyes deduced from the administration's new regulation replacing the Flores settlement agreement, which sets minimum standards for migrant children in government custody and limits their detention to 20 days. Without Flores in place, Trump claimed, migrants will find it ""impossible"" to come to the US ""illegally."" For Reyes, by contrast, the new regulation ""won't... help solve the humanitarian crisis at the border. The new rule is legally and logistically suspect. The only thing it guarantees is that more children will suffer greatly."" Acknowledging the Trump administration's efforts to ""make life harder for child migrants and migrants in general,"" Tina Rosenberg pointed out in the New York Times that the ""system's horrors run deeper."" Most unaccompanied immigrant children don't get deported when they have a lawyer, Rosenberg reported, but most children face a judge alone and those who don't rely on a network of volunteers, essentially sustaining the ""safety net for these children"" by the ""legal equivalent of a bake sale."" Planned Parenthood makes a choice Planned Parenthood, upon facing what Jill Filipovic described as an ""impossible choice,"" opted in a historic move to discontinue its receipt of funds from Title X, the federal family planning program that provides affordable birth control. To continue in the program, Planned Parenthood would have to both stop providing abortions and stop telling women where they could get legal abortion procedures. ""That's an unconscionable encroachment on free speech,"" argued Filipovic, because ""it effectively gags doctors and nurses from giving patients accurate information about their completely legal health care options."" Finding our best and body-positive selves Talk about pregnancy bubbled up on social media this week as well, thanks to model Ashley Graham and her viral Instagram post featuring a picture of her own pregnant body, which, Peggy Drexler opined, ""calls out pregnancy for what it is for so many: large and layered and pretty uncomfortable,"" while giving women permission to not always be perfect. That pressure to be body-perfect -- or even just to be smaller -- worried Holly Thomas, who called out a new WW (formerly Weight Watchers) app for children and adolescents. Wrote Thomas: ""A tragedy of encouraging children to listen to an app, rather than their stomachs, is that it robs them of weight-regulating tools they already had. And while it's up to parents — the ones who have the resources to do so -- to try to ensure their kids' access to good food, regular meals and plenty of exercise, offloading that responsibility onto a weight-loss app administered by non-professionals whose first interest is not in the health of these kids but in the health of its bottom line is quite possibly setting them up for an eating disorder."" Think before you share this video Lilit Marcus, who is a CODA (Child of Deaf Adults), and whose first language was American Sign Language, had a message for hearing folks who are sharing the now-viral video of ASL interpreter Amber Galloway Gallego working at a Twista performance: stop, think and ask yourself why you're doing it. Marcus, noting that many of those watching Gallego and sharing the video cited ""raising awareness"" about the Deaf community as a reason, said those folks have more work to do: ""Watching a signer communicate and thinking you'll learn ASL along the way is sort of like walking into a library and thinking you'll absorb all the information in the books just by looking at their covers. When people tell me they recently attended a live program that had an interpreter and that they loved watching him or her perform, I ask what new vocabulary words they picked up. Invariably, the answer is none. Seeing ASL as something cool to watch instead of as a vital service also gives us a peek into why we still have so much work to do in this country around accessibility."" Don't miss these other smart takes: Leila Salazar-López and Lindsey Allen: We are facing a global emergency in the Amazon. Here's what we can do Frida Ghitis: Hong Kong protests send a message Americans can hear loud and clear David Perry: The partisan rift over college will haunt us Shaharzad Akbar: I don't want the US to bargain away my son's future in Afghanistan Christopher Leonard for CNN Business Perspectives: David Koch was known for his political influence. This is his business legacy Mark Green: How to end the Ebola crisis And two more... A message from the 1990s How do beloved 1990s films and shows stack up? That was a question on a lot of people's minds this week. First HBO Max announced ""Rules of Magic,"" a 1960s prequel to the 1998 witch-mania favorite, ""Practical Magic."" That earlier Sandra Bullock vehicle, with its pop feminism and romantic love plots, doesn't hold up as well as she thought, wrote Breena Kerr, but that only emphasizes why she thinks this new 1960s prequel is just the right kind of magic needed in the age of Trump: ""Magic is a metaphor for personal power and the things that we can do when we set our minds to something. That's why movies about wizards and witches are so relatable — most people have a sense of stirring within them when they think about something they believe in, a sense of possibility that they could change the current reality."" Next up: ""Seinfeld"" and ""Friends"" are both celebrating big anniversaries this summer -- 30th and 25th respectively -- and while that's sparked some debate on social media about which show is the best, Melissa Blake declared it's not even close: ""Seinfeld,"" hands down. Its characters address all phases of life, not just a free-wheeling (and financially unrealistic) version of being in your 20s and 30s. As Blake reflected, ""while we may have wanted to be as cool and chic as Rachel Green in 'Friends,' in reality, we were all much more similar to awkward Elaine from 'Seinfeld.' Just think about it in contemporary terms. If Rachel were a real person living in 2019, she would be an Instagram influencer posting her #OOTD full of #sponsored clothing from hip places like Madewell or J. Crew. If Elaine were a real person living in 2019, she would probably swear off social media -- or use it to spy on her exes.""

87	https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/19/tech/china-social-media-hong-kong-twitter/index.html	Updated 7:44 AM ET, Tue August 20, 2019	Twitter cracks down on state media after unveiling Chinese campaign against Hong Kong protesters	"New York (CNN Business)Twitter will no longer accept advertisements from state-controlled media outlets, the company announced Monday, hours after it joined with Facebook to take down a covert Chinese social media campaign that sought to undermine pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. ""We want to protect healthy discourse and open conversation,"" Twitter said in a statement posted on its website. Twitter said the new policy would only apply to ""news media entities that are either financially or editorially controlled by the state."" While state media cannot pay for advertisements that would amplify their message, they will be allowed to continue posting on the platform. Twitter said the new restrictions do not apply to outlets funded by taxpayers, or independent public broadcasters. The new policy was announced shortly after Twitter said it had identified a network of more than 900 accounts originating in China that ""were deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement."" Some accounts called protesters ""cockroaches"" or compared them to Islamic State terrorists. The offending accounts have been taken down from Twitter and Facebook. It also came after BuzzFeed News and others reported that media outlets in China, most of which are funded by the state and tightly controlled by authorities in Beijing, had been buying advertisements on Facebook and Twitter that portrayed the protests negatively. ""Although the people behind this activity attempted to conceal their identities, our investigation found links to individuals associated with the Chinese government,"" Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, wrote in a blog post. Beijing responded on Tuesday. Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters that ""people will have their own judgments about what is happening in Hong Kong, and what the truth is."" ""I think it is reasonable that Chinese media use overseas social media to communicate with local people, to tell stories about China, to introduce Chinese policies,"" he said. This is the first time tech companies have pointed the finger at Beijing for covert efforts to influence messaging around the Hong Kong protests. Pro-democracy demonstrators have massed throughout Hong Kong for 11 consecutive weekends. An account that was titled ""Dream News"" tweeted about the demonstrators, ""We don't want you radical people in Hong Kong. Just get out of here!"" The accounts posted in multiple languages and at least some of them appeared to target American audiences. One account, that was set up more than 10 years ago, said in its Twitter bio, ""Conservative News from the USA and Abroad. #Catholic Defender of the Constitution of the United States."" The account claimed to support President Donald Trump. Other accounts also purported to be operated by people in the United States, listing locations like Chicago and Long Beach, California. Twitter initially identified the network and shared details about the accounts with Facebook (FB). Then, Facebook identified about a dozen pages, accounts and groups that were tied to the operation. The Facebook pages were followed by about 15,000 accounts, the company said. Twitter (TWTR) said many of the accounts accessed its platform using virtual private networks because Twitter is blocked in China. China, of course, is not alone in using social media to spread unrest. Covert campaigns have been tied to Russia and Iran, among other countries. In 2018 the US Department of Justice brought charges against a Kremlin-linked troll group that posed as American on social media in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election. -— Joshua Berlinger, Steven Jiang and Nanlin Fang contributed to this report.

88	https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/19/politics/mike-pence-china-hong-kong-trade/index.html	Updated 9:09 PM ET, Mon August 19, 2019	Pence talks tough to China over Hong Kong protests as trade war continues	"Washington (CNN)Vice President Mike Pence said Monday that chances of a trade deal with China would diminish if Hong Kong's laws are violated, also criticizing the country's human rights violations as antithetical to American ideals. ""We don't want China's markets to suffer. In fact, we want them to thrive,"" Pence said during a speech at the Detroit Economic Club. ""For the United States to make a deal with China, Beijing needs to honor its commitments, beginning with the commitment China made in 1984 to respect the integrity of Hong Kong's laws through the Sino-British joint declaration,"" Pence said. ""As the President said yesterday, it would be much harder for us to make a deal if something violent happens in Hong Kong."" Pence's stern words come a day after the President pivoted away from an earlier stance of neutrality over what happens to demonstrators in Hong Kong. The protest movement, which began in June over a now-shelved extradition bill, has since expanded to include calls for greater democracy and government accountability. President Donald Trump told reporters Sunday that he'd like to see the situation in Hong Kong ""worked out in a very humanitarian fashion."" Chinese President Xi Jinping, he said, ""sure has the ability"" to reach a resolution. ""I think it would be very good for the trade deal that we're talking about,"" Trump added. Pence, in his Detroit remarks on Monday, said China's open access to the US economy was made ""in the hope that freedom in China would expand in all of its forms,"" but over the last 17 years, China has not followed through economically, politically or in the realm of human rights. China, he said, has continued to pursue ""an arsenal of policies inconsistent with free trade."" Earlier this month, the Trump administration labeled China a currency manipulator. And last week, the US also delayed tariffs on China slated to go into effect in September. The tariffs would have affected $300 billion worth of Chinese-made goods. The latest wave of tariffs has been delayed until December 15, after Trump's advisers appealed to the President that the tariffs could have ruined Christmas. Trade talks between American and Chinese officials in the US could be on the horizon, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. Kudlow said that following a call with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese officials, there are plans for further talks with their offices' deputies. If those meetings ""pan out,"" he said, there will be a principals meeting in the US to continue negotiations."	CNN

She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to the Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. Follow her on Twitter @fridaghitis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. Read more opinion on CNN. (CNN)The images made you catch your breath. Under torrential rains and a canopy of umbrellas, thousands upon thousands of pro-democracy protesters defiantly -- but peacefully -- marched along the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday. China's regime has been trying to intimidate the protesters with credible, ominous threats that they could use brute force to put down the protests. Still, pro-democracy marchers turned out in astonishing numbers for the 11th week in a row. To the rest of the world, and to many in America, the bravery of the people of Hong Kong comes with a message: Is this what you should be doing? Organizers claimed 1.7 million marched. Authorities gave a much lower estimate for the initial gathering, but didn't update their figures. In a city of about 7 million, the organizers' estimate would amount to a huge segment of the population. Americans and their friends took notice. Hearing that estimate on Sunday, I tweeted, ""More than 20% of the population demonstrating in Hong Kong. Astonishing."" (I should have qualified in my tweet that it was the organizers' figure.) I was struck by the response. Thousands retweeted it, but what caught my attention was how many people suggested Americans should do the same. One after the other the comments came. ""Hey, America!!! Ever thought of doing this???""; ""We need to take a page from Hong Kong's book""; ""Our turn!!""; ""Can we do this please?""; ""Imagine 80 million outside the WH""; ""I wish Americans would take to the streets. What will it take? Shocking how much they are tolerating."" And on and on it went. Hong Kong, of course, is not the only place where pro-democracy demonstrators have taken to the streets, recently, challenging regimes with a history of violence, despite what look like dismal odds of success. In Russia, the riot police have been beating and imprisoning protesters who have peacefully demonstrated to call for free and fair elections. Perhaps nowhere was the courage of everyday citizens more breathtaking and the odds more daunting than in Sudan. There, demonstrators challenged a regime so brutal that its leader, Omar al-Bashir, was charged by the International Criminal Court with genocide and war crimes in 2008. Security forces killed scores during nine months of pro-democracy protests. (A CNN investigation discovered that Bashir's brutal crackdown against peaceful protesters was designed by a Russian firm with ties to the Kremlin.) Incredibly, protesters managed to topple Bashir. A new transitional government is now in place in Sudan, and Bashir went on trial on Monday. There's reason for some skepticism about whether democracy will follow, but there's no question that without the protests, the dictator Bashir would still rule in Khartoum. In Hong Kong, protests started as a pushback against a proposed law that would have allowed authorities to extradite people to China for trial. The bill has been withdrawn, but demonstrators have expanded their demands against China's steady erosion of their freedoms. They want more democracy. They are worried about what their future holds under Chinese rule. We still don't know how this will end. After all, the regime responsible for the Tiananmen massacre is massing troops near the border. Hong Kong, Russia and Sudan are only three places where calls for democracy have roiled the status quo, challenging powerful autocrats. But does that mean Americans, concerned about the authoritarian tendencies of a President who behaves dismissively toward democratic institutions, should emulate those tactics? To be sure, Trump's attacks on the media, his dismissiveness of Russia's interference in US elections, his jokes about staying in power indefinitely, his politicization of the judiciary, his relentless lying, all constitute a threat to democracy. But there are enormous differences between what is happening in the United States and in Hong Kong, Russia and elsewhere. One of the crucial differences is that the United States is still a functioning democracy with a viable path, through existing institutions, to bring about change. If Trump loses reelection, we expect that he will leave office under a system that guarantees that transfer of power. Mass protests have an important role to play in functioning democracies. That's why it was so significant that on the day after Trump took office, people across the United States staged one of the biggest demonstrations in the country's history, the Women's March. Protests on that scale, or the scale of those in Hong Kong, help no matter what country they're in to galvanize activists and spread their message, energize the population and send a powerful message that the public is paying attention. It is a warning to the government, and a reminder to the population of its own power. The strength is there, coiled, ready to be released with great force if needed. In Hong Kong, as in Russia and Sudan, the people felt they had no recourse. That's what happens when democratic freedoms vanish. For now, concerned Americans can channel their energy into helping turn out the vote, supporting candidates, working for change. Massive marches can help, but real change is still possible through democratic means. If that changes, if Russian interference or voter suppression undercut the legitimacy of the vote, people will think back to Hong Kong's oceans of persistent protesters. "	CNN

Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC said the advertisement, which was published in Hong Kong's Apple Daily on Friday, does not represent the companies' views. The advertisement reiterated five demands by activists, including the complete withdrawal of a proposed bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China. That bill has been shelved, but demonstrators are still calling for greater democracy in Hong Kong after 11 consecutive weekends of street protests. The ad also demanded that authorities drop criminal charges against protesters and establish an independent commission to investigate possible police misconduct. ""We are a group of concerned employees at the respective Big 4 accounting firms across multiple departments,"" the message read. ""We stand with all fellow Hongkongers."" All four of the firms, which collectively employ tens of thousands of people in Hong Kong and mainland China, responded soon after the ad was published. ""While we cannot verify the source of the statement and we respect the right of individuals to peacefully express their views, we want to clarify that this statement does not represent the views of the firm,"" said Deloitte. EY also said it could not confirm the ad's authenticity, and added that it ""does not share the views expressed in the statement."" PwC said it firmly opposed ""any action and statement that challenge national sovereignty."" And KPMG said it ""opposes any illegal acts and violence."" ""We hope that Hong Kong remains peaceful and continues to prosper as one of the world's most important international financial centres based on the rule of law and the principle of 'One Country, Two Systems,"" KPMG added, referring to the arrangement that affords the city political and legal freedoms that are not available on the Chinese mainland. The companies are not the first global businesses to have been caught in the fray between Hong Kong and Beijing. Last week, Cathay Pacific's CEO and chief commercial officer announced they would step down after the company was swept up in several controversies related to the protests, in which some of its employees took part. Those shock resignations were ""a watershed event"" for Hong Kong's business community, said Willy Lam, adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. China has traditionally let multinational companies operate in Hong Kong more freely than on the mainland, which has preserved the city's status as a global financial hub and gateway to China. Some analysts say the resignations at Cathay Pacific underscore a new willingness by Beijing to put big companies under pressure over the protests. More could soon face similar action."	CNN

But it's a tough time for the 5 million school children who don't have money for supplies. Here's how you can help them. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Potential mass shootings arrests Authorities in three states say they stopped three potential mass shootings over the past few days. All three cases were brought to their attention thanks to tips from the public. In Connecticut, 22-year-old Brandon Wagshol was arrested after he allegedly expressed interest on Facebook of committing a mass shooting. Authorities got a tip that he was trying to buy large capacity rifle magazines from another state and discovered he was trying to build his own rifle. In Florida, 25-year-old Tristan Scott Wix was arrested after he sent his ex-girlfriend disturbing text messages in which he allegedly threatened to commit a mass shooting, the Volusia County Sheriff's Office said. In Ohio, 20-year-old James Patrick Reardon was arrested after he allegedly threatened to shoot up a Jewish community center in Youngstown. A video on a social media account belonging to Reardon showed a man firing a gun. The community center was tagged in the video.  2. Afghanistan wedding attack Even in a place like Kabul, long-accustomed to such violence, this weekend's suicide bomb attack on a wedding there was a shocker. At least 63 people were killed (and almost 200 injured) after someone detonated an explosive vest at a wedding hall. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. All this happens as the US tries to finalize a peace plan with the Taliban that could end America's 18-year-war there. On Sunday President Trump said he didn't want Afghanistan to become a ""laboratory for terror.""  3. Hong Kong protests Another weekend, another massive protest in Hong Kong. Hundreds of thousands of people marched through Hong Kong's streets yesterday in the 11th straight weekend of mass anti-government demonstrations. The protest movement has been tested as of late by police bans and threats from the Chinese government. It rained during the marches, so much of the city center turned into a sea of slow moving umbrellas. The protests, which began in June over a now-shelved extradition bill, has since expanded to include calls for greater democracy and government accountability.  4. Brexit The dreaded no-deal Brexit is staring the UK right in the face -- and a government report leaked to a newspaper predicts it will be as disastrous as everyone fears. The report, printed in The Sunday Times, says the UK will face food, fuel and medicine shortages if it leaves the European Union without a trade deal. It added that the public and businesses were unprepared for a no-deal Brexit. A British official responsible for planning for a no-deal Brexit said the report represents the ""worst-case scenario."" The UK is due to leave the EU on October 31.  5. Climate crisis It's been a hot summer in Alaska. So hot that it's killing large numbers of salmon. One scientist told CNN that she and a group of colleagues on an expedition along the Koyukuk River counted 850 dead salmon, although they estimated the total was likely four to 10 times larger. None of the fish showed signs of lesions, parasites and infections, so the scientists concluded the die-off is connected with the heat wave. BREAKFAST BROWSE People are talking about these. Read up.

92	https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/16/asia/china-global-times-hu-xijin-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 11:46 PM ET, Fri August 16, 2019	The man taking on Hong Kong from deep inside China's propaganda machine	"Beijing (CNN)The editor of one of China's most outspoken state media outlets has doubled down on accusations that the United States is instigating a revolution in Hong Kong, as increasingly violent protests enter their eleventh weekend. ""Unrest on the street needs spiritual support, incitement and encouragement -- and that's exactly what the US and the West are offering, in a very deliberate and intense way,"" Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin told CNN on Thursday, in his first interview with foreign media since one of the newspaper's reporters was assaulted by protesters in Hong Kong. A former war correspondent for the People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper, 59-year-old Hu has a loyal following in China, where he posts daily commentaries in writing and videos to nearly 20 million fans on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. His presence on Twitter, which has long been blocked in China, is a more modest 75,400 followers. The tabloid that Hu edits is known for its nationalistic coverage and bellicose opinions, which are frequently quoted by Western media. Like all state media outlets in China, it operates within a heavily censored environment that is tightly controlled by Communist authorities. Published in both Chinese and English, the Global Times boasts a daily circulation of two million copies, and every month its website attracts around 30 million unique visitors. Where other state media outlets adopt a more measured tone, Hu's paper takes a combative approach to covering international issues by calling out perceived threats and slights to China from across the world. ""(US politicians and officials) are telling Hong Kong society that you've become a model for democracy for the world,"" Hu said, recalling his own experience as a student protester in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989. Hu's decision to reference Tiananmen Square, the site of mass protests that ended when Chinese soldiers opened fire -- killing hundreds, if not thousands of people -- is surprising because the subject is still largely taboo for China's state media. ""I was a student in the square and we listened to the Voice of America every day. It was immensely encouraging when we heard US leaders say such things,"" he added. ""How could you say that the US bears no responsibility for what's happening in Hong Kong?"" Claims of a color revolution Since early June, hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers have demonstrated against a controversial -- and now-shelved -- bill that would have allowed extradition from the city to mainland China. Protesters say the freedoms that Beijing guaranteed to Hong Kong when Britain handed the former colony back to China in 1997 are being eroded, and they fear what will happen when the central government takes full control of the territory after the 50-year ""one country, two systems"" agreement ends in 2047. Backed by Beijing, Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam has said the protests are pushing the city ""to the brink of no return."" China has been unequivocal in its condemnation of the protests, with one official saying ""radical demonstrators"" had begun to show ""signs of terrorism."" Chinese officials -- and Hu's Global Times -- have also compared the protests to the ""color revolutions"" of the 2000s that succeeded in toppling governments in the former Soviet Union and the Balkans. The comparison suggests that the protesters' aim is to overthrow the government, which is not among their stated goals. The State Department has rejected suggestions that the US has played any role in the crisis, and has called on Beijing to exercise restraint. ""We categorically reject the false charge of foreign forces as the black hand behind the protests. The continued erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy puts at risk its long-established special status in international affairs,"" the department said in a statement. Violence at the airport The Global Times assigned its own reporters to cover the Hong Kong protests, which in recent weeks have descended into running street battles between police armed with tear gas and protesters wearing hardhats and face masks. Some of the worst violence occurred on Tuesday night, when throngs of protesters crammed the departure hall at Hong Kong International Airport, blocking passengers from reaching their flights and prompting authorities to shut down the international aviation hub. Amid the melee, an angry group of protesters seized Beijing-based Global Times reporter Fu Guohao. They beat him, bound his wrists with zip-ties and held him captive on a luggage trolley, reportedly because he refused to identify himself while taking close-up photos of demonstrators' faces. He was eventually released and escorted from the airport by paramedics, but his brief detention has sparked outrage across mainland China. It's also turned the 28-year-old journalist into a ""hero"" on Chinese social media, where commentators praised his bravery for standing up to what they called ""thuggish mobsters."" Hu denied suggestions that the government was using the incident to push its narrative that the protesters are unruly ""rioters."" He said Fu's detention had merely tapped into popular opinion in China that the protesters had turned extreme. ""Global Times hasn't portrayed him as a hero, nor have I, in my social media posts, or in our editorials. His behavior echoed public sentiment in China, where many have thought the protesters in Hong Kong have gone too far and there is a lot of pent-up anger among Chinese,"" Hu said, adding ""no one's guiding the public on this."" Hu said Fu didn't identify himself to protesters because many mainland journalists feel threatened in Hong Kong and ""tend to be vague to avoid trouble."" ""It's been a common strategy adopted by mainland journalists, not just Fu. He didn't try to deceive anyone."" Fu wasn't the only man beaten at the airport -- two others required medical attention after being singled out by the crowd. On Wednesday, small groups of protesters returned to the airport, holding signs saying ""we're deeply sorry."" A statement emailed to CNN by one group said, ""We are frightened, angry and exhausted.. and would like to express our most sincere apologies."" 'We say things out loud' Founded in 1993, the Global Times is run by the People's Daily, and its 800 staff work in several locations inside the publication's headquarters in eastern Beijing. From a seventh-floor newsroom that overlooks the futuristic skyline of Beijing's Central Business District, Hu -- whose soft-spoken style belies his fiery rhetoric -- claims his paper best reflects the views of Chinese people to a global audience. ""We say things out loud,"" he said. ""You could call us radical or nationalistic, but we reflect true sentiments of Chinese society. You could learn the truth better through us. That's our appeal and that's why Western media like to quote us."" Echoing the Beijing leadership's increasingly hardened stance toward the Hong Kong protesters, Hu and his paper have been quick to publish threatening videos showing the massing of Chinese troops in the southern city of Shenzhen near the Hong Kong border. However, Hu rejected suggestions the Global Times was helping Beijing to prepare the public for a potential military crackdown to end the protests. ""We are just reporting the news. We obtained the video and believed that the amassing of the People's Armed Police soldiers was meant to send a strong signal,"" Hu said. ""It was obviously a clear warning to the perpetrators of violence in Hong Kong. That was our analysis. You would've drawn the same conclusion in my position. Could we call it just a regular exercise? That would be insincere. No one would believe us and we would lose credibility."" On Wednesday, CNN teams in Shenzhen saw uniformed members of the People's Armed Police Force (PAP) with riot shields and batons, as well as numerous semi-militarized vehicles, stationed at the city's Bay Sports Center. The PAP is the 1.5 million-member paramilitary force the government regularly deploys to quell protests within its borders. Observers say the use of PAP officers to end the Hong Kong protests is unlikely as it would severely undermine the city's reputation as a safe international hub, backed by strong legal protections. However, Hu said Beijing's first obligation was to the people of Hong Kong, not the international community. ""The US wants to see chaos in Hong Kong and use it to pressure China, but Beijing has a responsibility to ensure peace, stability and development in Hong Kong,"" Hu said. ""If there were no longer other options, then this (military) option would have to be used -- and at that point, reactions from the US or the West would matter very little."" If that makes him sound like a government spokesman, Hu doesn't seem to mind. The savvy editor has even earned an unflattering nickname, ""Frisbee Hu,"" arising from a joke on his ability to retrieve whatever the government throws at him. Hu has defended his paper's coverage of the Hong Kong protests, brushing aside criticisms of its ""one-sided"" coverage and insisting that ""we take a stand in our reporting"" just like Western media. ""I think our level of support for the government is comparable to yours to the pro-democracy camp,"" he said. Calling the differentiation between news and propaganda a Western concept, Hu said his mission is clear in China's one-party political system. ""We need to help the government and the people communicate with each other, instead of pitting them against each other,"" he said. ""Media outlets that pit the government against the people don't have a future in China."" ""Some of my critics are a reflection of my debate with Western media and values,"" he added, to the applause from underlings standing nearby. ""I want to promote progress in China and preserve China's national interests -- if I become a controversial figure because of this, so what?"""	CNN
93	https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/16/politics/donald-trump-hong-kong-israel-greenland-week-in-review/index.html	Updated 7:33 PM ET, Fri August 16, 2019	Around the world with Donald Trump in 1 week	"Washington (CNN)As protests gripped Hong Kong this week, President Donald Trump had some advice for Chinese President Xi Jinping on how to handle the clashes. ""I have ZERO doubt that if President Xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem, he can do it. Personal meeting?"" Trump tweeted on Wednesday.  People in Hong Kong have been protesting since June, initially over a proposed extradition bill that would have allowed citizens to be sent over the border to mainland China. More recently, the protests and police response have been marked by violence, tear gas and, this week, a shutdown of Hong Kong's busy airport.  Trump's own involvement with China has become more complicated too, as the President's administration delayed implementing new tariffs on Chinese-made goods until December 15. ""What we've done is we've delayed it so they won't be relevant in the Christmas shopping season,"" Trump told reporters on Wednesday. ""Just in case they might have an impact on people."" Trump also stirred up controversy over whether two members of Congress should be allowed to travel to Israel. Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota had planned to visit Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Ramallah and Hebron. Tlaib and Omar have been vocal critics of Israel and have supported the boycott movement. Trump tweeted, ""It would show great weakness if Israel allowed Rep. Omar and Rep. Tlaib to visit,"" adding that the two Democratic congresswomen, who have been vocal critics of Trump, ""hate Israel and all Jewish people.""  Israel later announced it would bar Trump's political opponents from entering the country. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a Trump ally, echoed Trump's tweeted sentiments: ""The plan of the two Congresswomen is only to damage Israel and to foment against Israel,"" Netanyahu said in a statement. On Thursday, reports emerged that Trump had his eye on another international parcel: the island of Greenland.  The Wall Street Journal reported that the President had raised the issue during meetings and dinners, asking aides and listening seriously about the possibility and advantages of owning Greenland.  There's no offer specifically on the table -- and already buying Greenland (technically owned by Denmark but run by an autonomous government) seems not to be feasible. As Greenland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs tweeted on Friday, ""We're open for business, not for sale.""

94	https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/16/business/cathay-pacific-ceo-china/index.html	Updated 4:19 PM ET, Fri August 16, 2019	The week that Cathay Pacific surrendered to China	"Hong Kong (CNN Business)One of the world's top airlines has discovered just how dangerous Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests are becoming for companies based in the city and doing business with mainland China. The stunning resignations late Friday of Cathay Pacific's CEO and chief commercial officer came at the end of a tumultuous couple of weeks for the airline. No company has become more emblematic of just how thin a line businesses are having to walk as largely peaceful protests by huge crowds escalate into violent clashes between smaller groups of protesters and police. China is furious at the challenge to its authority and has threatened a crackdown if the situation deteriorates further. More demonstrations are planned for this weekend. Cathay's (CPCAY) crisis intensified a week ago. First it had to accept restrictions from Chinese authorities on who could fly its planes over the country. Then it threatened staff with dismissal if they took part in the protests. None of that was enough to save two of the company's highest ranking executives, and news of their departures broke first on Chinese state media. ""International businesses have to face a new reality here,"" said Ronald Wan, chief executive of Partners Capital International in Hong Kong. For more than 20 years, the former British colony has operated under a rule known as ""One Country, Two Systems,"" which affords the city political and legal freedoms that are not available on the Chinese mainland. That has helped protect Hong Kong's status as a formidable financial hub, and reassured foreign companies that the city is a safe and stable place to operate. But the Cathay crisis indicates a shift in how China views the city — and how it expects companies to operate there. ""Beijing is increasingly hard-lined about sovereignty and territorial integrity issues,"" Wan added. ""Hong Kong is no longer a shelter. It's not 'Hong Kong, China.' It's China."" A tumultuous two weeks The political turmoil started months ago when Hong Kong residents began protesting a controversial bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China. The bill was eventually shelved, but the demonstrations have evolved into a broader call for greater democracy and an inquiry into alleged police brutality. Cathay's central role came into focus much more recently. More than a thousand of its employees took part in a strike last week that forced the airline to cancel over 150 flights. Days later, China said it would not allow Cathay flights crewed by people who have taken part in ""illegal demonstrations, protests and violent attacks"" to use its airspace. It forced the airline to provide crew IDs. The airline had little choice but to comply with the order, since Cathay not only flies in and out of mainland China but also through its airspace to reach Europe and the United States. ""The threat by Chinese civil aviation authorities to essentially ban aircrew taking part in Hong Kong protests from operating China flights is impossible to ignore, touching on half of the carrier's revenue,"" said David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project. ""I think we can expect to see many more examples like this going forward, of China using its economic leverage to push its political agenda."" But Cathay's capitulation didn't end there. On Monday, the company hardened its language and warned that it could fire employees who take part in illegal protests. Chinese aviation authorities met with Merlin Swire — the billionaire head of Cathay's biggest shareholder, Swire Pacific (SWRAY) — that same day. Then on Wednesday, Cathay said that it had terminated two pilots, without giving a reason. A well-placed source within the company told CNN the pilots were fired in association with activities related to the protests. All the while, Cathay was grappling with threats to its bottom line. Hundreds more flights were canceled earlier this week as protesters overran the airport, and bookings are being affected. Its stock has plummeted more than 12% within the last month. By Friday, the company would announce that CEO Rupert Hogg and Chief Commercial Officer Paul Loo were out. The 'sins' of Cathay Pacific China Central Television, the mainland outlet that broke the news that Hogg was out, later published a long post Friday night on Chinese social network Weibo that characterized Cathay's actions as ""sins."" ""No zuo no die!"" the state-owned media wrote, using slang that translates to: ""If you don't do stupid things, they won't come back and bite you in the a--."" CCTV pointed out that Cathay ""said some employees' behavior doesn't represent the position of the company"" only after the Chinese aviation authority acted. It accused the airline of having ""flawed"" professional ethics. Cathay did not give specific reasons for the management changes. But Chairman John Slosar said in a statement that ""recent events have called into question Cathay Pacific's commitment to flight safety and security and put our reputation and brand under pressure."" Hogg, meanwhile, told employees in a memo to staff that it was a ""grave and critical time"" for the airline. ""There is no doubt that our reputation and brand are under immense pressure and this pressure has been building for some weeks, particularly in the all-important market of mainland China,"" Hogg wrote in the memo, which the airline shared with CNN Business. ""Could we have managed things differently? In hindsight, 'yes'."" Greg Waldron, the Asia managing editor for the aviation news source FlightGlobal Group, said he didn't want to speculate about the reasons for the departure. But he said the episode highlights the challenge for the airline. ""It's unprecedented,"" Waldron said. ""Clearly it doesn't want to upset Beijing. It wants to avoid politics and stay focused on its business."" Part of a trend What happened to Cathay this week likely won't be an anomaly, said William Reinsch, the Scholl chair for international business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. He said that the Chinese government is already increasing its efforts to control companies and pressure them to conform to the party line. ""In [President] Xi Jinping's administration, priority number one is maintaining party control,"" Reinsch added. ""That's self preservation, and that's more important than anything else."" Businesses in Hong Kong could feel a chilling effect. The financial sector depends on stability, he added. Without that in the city, some businesses might feel the need to uproot and move to other places in the region, like Singapore. ""It creates enormous uncertainty about the government's intentions,"" Reinsch added. ""And what people tend to do when there's uncertainty is they either do nothing and wait, or if they foresee the situation continuing, they move."" Wan, the Partners Capital International executive, said there will likely be wide-reaching consequences for other firms. ""I'm afraid Cathay is not the only one that has to make a compromise,"" he said. For western businesses like HSBC (HBCYF) or the Jardines conglomerate, ""if you can't move your businesses out of Hong Kong, you have to compromise, too."" -- CNN Business' Laura He and Michelle Toh contributed to this report.

95	https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/16/business/cathay-pacific-ceo-rupert-hogg/index.html	Updated 10:31 AM ET, Fri August 16, 2019	Cathay Pacific CEO resigns amid Hong Kong protests	"Hong Kong (CNN Business)Cathay Pacific CEO Rupert Hogg is resigning after a tumultuous week for Hong Kong's leading airline. The company has been caught in a political firestorm because of the city's pro-democracy protests that have angered Beijing. Its business and stock price is also hurting -— hundreds of its flights were canceled when protesters overran the airport and bookings are down. ""This is a grave and critical time for our airlines. There is no doubt that our reputation and brand are under immense pressure and this pressure has been building for some weeks, particularly in the all-important market of mainland China,"" Hogg wrote in a memo to staff which Cathay shared with CNN Business. ""Could we have managed things differently? In hindsight, 'yes'."" Paul Loo, the airline's chief commercial officer, is also stepping down, the company said in a stock exchange filing on Friday. The resignations, first reported by Chinese state media, will take effect on Monday. ""Recent events have called into question Cathay Pacific's commitment to flight safety and security and put our reputation and brand under pressure,"" said Cathay Chairman John Slosar in a statement. ""This is regrettable as we have always made safety and security our highest priority."" Slosar did not elaborate further, but the airline has been swept up in numerous controversies related to the demonstrations. China said last week that it would not allow Cathay flights crewed by people who have taken part in ""illegal demonstrations, protests and violent attacks"" to use its airspace, a rule the airline said it would follow. Cathay then warned it could fire employees who take part in illegal protests. On Wednesday, the company said it had terminated two pilots, without disclosing the reason. A well-placed source within the company told CNN the pilots were fired in association with activities related to ongoing protests. The company source said one of the pilots was charged with rioting in Hong Kong and had been suspended from duty since July 30. China's aviation authority said earlier this week that it met with Merlin Swire, the billionaire head of Cathay's biggest shareholder, Swire Pacific. Swire Pacific has been among the companies to condemn ""illegal activities and violent behavior"" in Hong Kong. Worker participation in the protests is not the only issue that Cathay is grappling with. The political turmoil that has engulfed Asia's premiere financial hub for nearly 11 weeks is also starting to take a toll on Cathay's bottom line. The airline was forced to cancel more than 150 flights last week amid a day of mass demonstrations and strikes. The protests at Hong Kong's international airport earlier this week led to nearly 1,000 flights being canceled. Cathay said last week that protests affected its passenger numbers last month, and were continuing to ""adversely impact"" future bookings. Cathay's (CPCAY) stock has plummeted nearly 24% since April. ""It has been my honour to lead the Cathay Pacific Group over the last three years,"" Hogg said in a statement. ""I am confident in the future of Hong Kong as the key aviation hub in Asia. However, these have been challenging weeks for the airline and it is right that Paul and I take responsibility as leaders of the company."" Hogg will be replaced as CEO by Augustus Tang, the chief executive of Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company, another Swire firm. Loo will be replaced by Ronald Lam, the head of HK Express, a Cathay subsidiary."	CNN
96	https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/15/investing/dow-stock-market-today/index.html	Updated 6:50 PM ET, Thu August 15, 2019	Dow gives investors whiplash after the worst day of the year for stocks	"New York (CNN Business)The Dow recovered somewhat Thursday from an 800-point loss a day earlier, the worst of 2019. But investors are unsure of what will happen next in the markets. Conflicting signals are giving people whiplash. Several negative signs are weighing on markets: The yield curve flashed a recession warning sign Wednesday. The global economy is slowing down. And the trade war, which has unnerved investors for a year and a half, will continue to loom over markets until it is completely resolved. But Walmart on Thursday suggested American consumers are confident in the economy, and will keep spending throughout the rest of the year. And China tried to ease trade war concerns by saying it remains open to negotiations with the United States. The push and pull was evident Thursday morning, as Dow futures swung wildly: Up 200 points, down 200 points and up nearly 200 points once again. After the Dow opened up more than 100 points, it turned negative before heading for positive territory once again. By the end of the day, the Dow (INDU) finished with a gain of about 100 points, or 0.4%. The S&P 500 (SPX) was 0.25% higher. The Nasdaq (COMP), with its many tech companies, fell slightly -- 0.1%. Tech companies would be particularly hurt by an escalation of the trade war. China A threat from China started Thursday's markets on the wrong foot. The Chinese Ministry of Finance said it would ""take necessary countermeasures"" after the United States earlier this month announced a new 10% tariff on $300 billion in Chinese goods. China said the new tariffs ""seriously violated the consensus"" that Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping agreed to at the G20 meeting earlier this year. China has previously said it would retaliate against any new tariffs tit for tat, but the statement nonetheless spooked markets. Yet China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying then calmed investors fears in a press conference Thursday, when she said China remains hopeful the United States and China can ""work out a mutually acceptable solution."" None of this is particularly new. China has said all this before. But investors are on edge, turning some trade war molehills into mountains. Also, more signs of the global economic slowdown emerged Thursday, as China injected $2.4 billion in stimulus into the Hong Kong economy. The Hong Kong protests have hurt the tourism economy. The airport has been shut down after protesters barricaded themselves inside. Walmart By contrast, Walmart (WMT) said its outlook for the rest of 2019 has improved after Americans shopped more at US stores in the second quarter. With its huge network of thousands of stores, Walmart is a barometer for consumer spending. The company said sales increased 2.8%, and it raised its guidance for the remainder of the year, signaling optimism about the strength of its business. Shares of Walmart, a Dow component, gained 6.1%. Chinese online retail giant Alibaba (BABA) also reported strong results, sending its shares up 3%. But Cisco (CSCO), another Dow component, provided a much gloomier outlook. Cisco is a bellwether for the global economy: The networking technology company sells telecommunications equipment around the world, including routers and switches that power cell phone and broadband networks. Despite reporting strong sales last quarter, Cisco warned Wednesday evening that weakness in China and other countries contributed to slumping demand for tech products. Cisco's stock fell 8.6% Thursday. General Electric was another big loser. The stock plunged more than 11% after accountant Harry Markopolos, who helped expose the Bernie Madoff scandal, said in a report released Thursday that GE (GE) was hiding nearly $40 billion of losses in its insurance business. GE strongly denied Markopolos' allegations, calling them ""meritless."" The yield curve Wednesday, the yield curve between the 10-year and 2-year Treasury bonds inverted. That classic recession signal scared investors. Although the 2/10 yield curve has reverted, Treasury yields, which move in opposite direction to bond prices, remained lower Thursday.

A series of economic and political shocks are fomenting disorder across the planet and straining an international political system that Trump deliberately set out to undermine. Stock markets are tumbling as warning signs flash of a global recession exacerbated by fears deepened by the US-China trade war.
Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan are locked in a dangerous new standoff.
The post-Cold War arms control regime is breaking down.
South Korea and Japan -- the foundation of US influence in Asia -- are reviving age-old animosity.
Concern about a Tiananmen Square-style crackdown by Beijing in Hong Kong is growing as Trump looks the other way.
Iran and the US just narrowly avoided spiraling into a disastrous war partly precipitated by the President's maximum pressure campaign.
And the European Union -- for years a crucial co-sponsor with the US of world stability -- is seeing one of its three most influential members, Britain, heading for the exits, with enthusiastic encouragement from the White House. Trump did not cause all these crises. But his actions or unwillingness to temper them did deepen the discord in many cases. And his refusal to play the kind of stabilizing leadership role expected of a US president is fomenting power vacuums and may convince key protagonists in each drama that they may not face the kinds of consequences they might normally expect from Washington. The President's worldview is rooted in his enduring belief that the world has been ripping America off for generations and that strength and unilateral US action are the only way to restore respect. He believes engagement abroad inevitably leads to costly commitments and bloody disasters like the Iraq War. But Trump's foreign policy achievements -- apart from piling up glowing flattery by leaders intent on exploiting his craving for praise -- are questionable at best. He can claim to have finished an operation started in the Obama administration to stamp out ISIS. And there is a recognition in Washington that China's economic policies needed to be challenged. But the US and the rest of the world are learning the price of an improvisational approach shaped largely to satisfy Trump's domestic political requirements that often seems strategized only in the time it takes to commit it to Twitter. Wednesday's grim economic news made the risks of such an approach clearer than ever, raising the possibility that Trump's mission to turn the world upside down could blow up in his face. Trump worried about economic blowback Trump's hopes of four more years in office rest largely on the strength of the US economy. So a flurry of data on Wednesday that sent global stocks plunging -- including an 800-point plummet on the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- sent alarm through the White House. The bond markets sent an early warning signal of a possible recession that has been uncannily accurate in the past. Germany's economy shuddered closer toward a slowdown. Another key global economic engine, China, saw industrial output slump to levels not seen in 17 years. Both nations are targets of a tariff-wielding Trump. The data is the most compelling argument yet that Trump's statement that ""trade wars are good and easy to win"" and that the uncertainty and damage caused especially with his economic duel with Chinese President Xi Jinping are piling pressure on a global economy already beginning to face harsh headwinds. The fundamentals in the US economy remain strong after a tear of job creation and sustained growth over two presidencies. But the President for the first time this week hinted that he understands that his big gamble on China may be hurting Americans as well as weakening Beijing's economy, when he delayed a planned new $150 billion tariff hike. ""We're doing this for Christmas season, just in case some of the tariffs would have an impact on US customers,"" Trump said. As bearish sentiment multiplied on Wednesday, however, Trump was not accepting blame but looking for scapegoats. ""We are winning, big time, against China. Companies & jobs are fleeing. Prices to us have not gone up, and in some cases, have come down,"" the President tweeted. ""China is not our problem, though Hong Kong is not helping. Our problem is with the Fed. Raised too much & too fast. Now too slow to cut...."" Trump warned on 'pathetic' response to Hong Kong protests  It is not only on economic matters that America under Trump has ditched approaches on which the rest of the world once relied. Days of political violence in Hong Kong have underscored how Trump has changed the character of America's geopolitical role. Almost any other President in recent history would have delivered a robust warning to Beijing not to resort to a violent crackdown against demonstrators demanding the kinds of political freedoms that America has long epitomized. Yet Trump, who never tires of stressing his strong relationship with China's Xi, has left the impression that he wouldn't allow suppression to divert his China policy goals. ""We'll see what happens but I'm sure it'll work out. I hope it works out for everybody, including China, by the way. I hope it works out for everybody,"" Trump told reporters on Wednesday. Human rights have waxed and waned as an influence on foreign policy for 40 years, but have never been as much as an afterthought as they are for Trump. Foreign Policy for America, a nonpartisan advocacy organization, accused Trump of trashing America's essential values. ""Trump's pathetic statement -- apparently an attempt to appease China -- is yet another disgraceful example of his bizarre affection for dictators,"" the group warned in a statement. National security adviser John Bolton warned Beijing in a Voice of America interview on Wednesday that Americans remembered the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 and would not tolerate a repeat. ""It would be a big mistake to create a new memory like that in Hong Kong,"" said Bolton. But as always, it is unclear whether Trump's subordinates, even those supposed to be running foreign policy, speak for the President. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, for example, told CNBC on Wednesday that developments in Hong Kong were an ""internal matter"" for China. Some analysts believe that China is unlikely to intervene militarily to quell the uprising, to avoid detracting from the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule in October. Yet the intense political pressure Xi is now facing makes it even less likely that he has the political running room to make concessions that Trump is demanding in a trade war that may have existential implications for his own grip on power. The cost of ignoring diplomacy  Hong Kong is not the only global flashpoint that shows an administration apparently disengaged from developments that threaten a traditional reading of American interests. The flare-up between Japan and South Korea could undermine the alliance system that that projects US power in Asia. Trump has halfheartedly offered to mediate but warned last month that doing so would be a ""full-time job."" The conservative Heritage Foundation warned in a new report this month that ""the US government has an important role to play in mediating the relationship between Tokyo and Seoul and protecting vital trilateral security coordination."" But Trump most often speaks of the two US allies when he fulminates against what he sees as their freeloading off US defense guarantees. And his main concern on the Korean Peninsula is protecting his pen pal relationship with North Korean tyrant Kim Jong Un, which has yielded ""very beautiful"" letters but made no progress toward ending the isolated state's nuclear program. A recent spike in tensions between India and Pakistan, meanwhile, did not stir the kind of panicked US diplomacy spurred by prior confrontations between the enemies for instance in the Clinton administration. Some analysts have speculated that Trump's offer to mediate between the two rivals -- which appeared to trample the sensitivities of the dispute over Kashmir -- during a visit by Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan actually precipitated the crisis. Washington's muted global diplomacy prompted Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, to warn Wednesday of the cost of disengagement by an ""America First"" administration. ""Someone needs to remind the Potus & sec of state that diplomacy is a tool of national security-and that ignoring it will bring about a world of diminished US influence, greater conflict, less freedom and prosperity, and increased demands on the US military,"" Haass tweeted.

(You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Jeffrey Epstein Jeffrey Epstein had ""multiple breaks in his neck bones,"" according to an autopsy performed on the multimillionaire hedge fund manager. People familiar with the autopsy report told the Washington Post the bones broken in Epstein's neck included the hyoid bone, which is near the Adam's apple. This sort of break can happen when a person hangs themselves or dies by strangulation, forensics experts told the Post. The autopsy raises even more questions about how Epstein died. He was found dead over the weekend in his cell in a New York jail. He'd been jailed since last month, awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. 2. Economy Looks like those warning lights on the economy will keep flashing red today. Asian markets stumbled this morning, after Wall Street suffered its worst day of the year. The Dow tumbled 800 points yesterday after the bond market showed -- for the first time in more than a decade -- an inverted yield curve. What's that, you ask? You can read the particulars about it here, but just know that it's bad news. It has preceded every recession in modern history. Add to that the uncertainties brought on by the trade war with China and evidence of economic slowdowns in other countries, and this Wall Street freak-out becomes more understandable. 3. Philadelphia police officers shot A suspect was taken into custody last night, ending an eight-hour shooting standoff in north Philadelphia that left six police officers wounded. It all started when police went to a row house with a narcotics warrant. Some of the officers were in the kitchen of the house when the shooter began firing and police shot back. The gunman continued firing intermittently at police -- sometimes shooting out of a window -- during the standoff. Some of the officers escaped, but others were trapped in the home with the shooter. They were later rescued by a SWAT team. The wounded officers had non-life threatening injuries and have all been released from the hospital. 4. New York child sex abuse lawsuits More than 400 lawsuits were filed in New York yesterday as part of a new child sex abuse law in the state. The New York Child Victims Act lets adult survivors of child sexual abuse sue an abuser or a negligent institution, no matter how long ago the abuse took place. The law instituted a one-year period for the filing of lawsuits, which began yesterday. A state court official said so many lawsuits are expected that 45 judges have been set aside to deal with the cases. 5. Hong Kong protests China has sent large numbers of paramilitary forces close to the border with Hong Kong. CNN teams in the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen saw uniformed members of the People's Armed Police Force with riot shields and batons, as well as numerous semi-militarized vehicles, stationed at the city's Bay Sports Center yesterday.

99	https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/15/china/trump-xi-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 3:56 AM ET, Thu August 15, 2019	Hong Kong protests: Trump offers to meet with China's Xi to resolve crisis	"Hong Kong (CNN)United States President Donald Trump has suggested that China should deal with protests in Hong Kong ""humanely"" before making a trade deal with the US. In a series of tweets late Wednesday, Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping as a ""good man"" and suggested the two leaders hold a personal meeting to sort out the political crisis in Hong Kong and the escalating trade war between the US and China. ""Of course China wants to make a deal. Let them work humanely with Hong Kong first!"" Trump tweeted. On Tuesday, the US announced that it would postpone new tariffs on some Chinese-made consumer goods until December, instead of applying them in September as originally planned. Meanwhile, increasingly violent and unpredictable anti-government protests have wracked Hong Kong. The unrest, which began in early June, risks becoming the most serious challenge to Xi since he came to power in 2012. On Tuesday, clashes broke out between protesters and riot police after thousands of demonstrators occupied the city's international airport -- one of the busiest in the world -- leading to hundreds of canceled flights. Trump, who has faced criticism for not taking a tough enough stance on China over Hong Kong, said that he believes Xi can solve the situation ""quickly and humanely."" ""I know President Xi of China very well. He is a great leader who very much has the respect of his people. He is also a good man in a ""tough business,""' Trump said. ""I have ZERO doubt that if President Xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem, he can do it. Personal meeting?"" Fears that Chinese forces could enter the city and quash the protests have been rife in Hong Kong, where memories of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre -- where Peoples' Liberation Army troops brutally put down pro-democracy protests -- is still fresh in residents' minds. Trump's tweets come as China has deployed large numbers of paramilitary personnel close to the Hong Kong border, in what observers say is intended to send a message to protesters in the Asian financial hub. On Wednesday, CNN teams on the ground in the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen saw uniformed members of the People's Armed Police Force (PAP) with riot shields and batons, as well as numerous semi-militarized vehicles, stationed at the city's Bay Sports Center. The PAP is the 1.5 million-member paramilitary force the government regularly deploys to quell protests within its borders. It is under the command of China's central military commission, headed by Chinese President Xi Jinping. But there has been no indication that the PAP are set to do that, and such an intervention could have devastating effects on the territory's economy. Analysts and US officials say it is unlikely that China would intervene militarily. US national security adviser John Bolton warned China to ""look very carefully at the steps they take"" because America still remembers the Tiananmen crackdown and it would be a ""big mistake to create a new memory like that in Hong Kong."" But the Chinese government has ramped up its rhetoric against protesters, with Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, China's top body in charge of affairs in the city, saying on Monday the protests showed ""signs of terrorism."" Chinese officials have also accused Washington and other foreign governments of ""meddling"" in the protests and using them as a vehicle to attack China. Protesters are calling for greater democratic freedoms, an independent inquiry into police misconduct and the formal withdrawal of an extradition bill to the mainland. As Beijing works out what to do with Hong Kong, it is fighting a bitter trade war with the US, a slowing economy and its standoff with the United States."	CNN

Thousands of anti-government protesters blockaded the main terminal at Hong Kong's airport for a second straight night, temporarily stopping flights. Protesters overran airport security and used luggage carts to set up barricades in front of security checkpoints. They also physically blocked passengers from getting to their flights. In the ensuing clashes between protesters and riot police, six people were hospitalized and five others were arrested. The airport resumed operations this morning, with airport staff seen removing stains and covering up graffiti as passengers arrived. Click here for the latest on the unrest and to find out why demonstrators are still protesting. 2. Dayton mass shooting Police in Dayton, Ohio, provided a detailed timeline in the mass shooting there earlier this month. But it doesn't answer the biggest question: why. The 24-year-old shooter arrived in the nightclub district with his sister and a companion. He left them at a bar named Blind Bob's and went to another nightspot, called Ned Peppers, by himself about 30 minutes before he went back to a vehicle, got his gun and started shooting, according to the timeline pieced together from security cameras. Police said there's a ""strong possibility"" the shooter visited Ned Peppers by himself to case the place. Police also still aren't sure if the shooter targeted his sister and the friend. The shooter knew they were still in the area when he started firing because they had been texting and talking on the phone. Nine people were killed in the attack. 3. US and China There won't be any new tariffs on Chinese-made consumer goods until December 15. That means popular items, like toys, cell phones and video game consoles, won't be subject to price hikes possibly caused by the tariffs during the important Christmas shopping season. President Trump, who has used the threat of tariffs as a negotiating tactic, said he made the move to spare consumers pain heading into the holiday season. Wall Street appreciated the move, and stocks surged almost 400 points. 4. Russia explosion People living near a suspected missile accident in Russia won't have to leave their homes after all. Russian officials called off a planned evacuation of a village in the northern part of the country. It's believed an explosion last week involving a nuclear-powered cruise missile caused radiation levels to spike around the small settlement of Nyonoksa. At least five nuclear specialists were killed in the blast. Residents previously had been advised to leave their homes for safety because the military was planning exercises today, but the military drills were canceled. 5. Social media and teens Another study lays out why social media could be bad for our kids. This study, published yesterday in the journal The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health, says social media use is detrimental to teen girls' mental health because it increases their exposure to bullying and keeps them from more beneficial activities, like sleep and exercise.

101	https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/13/asia/china-hong-kong-terrorism-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 8:21 PM ET, Tue August 13, 2019	Beijing says Hong Kong protests 'show signs of terrorism.' If you only watch state media, you probably agree	"Hong Kong (CNN)Out-of-control mobs beating up police. Crazed separatists throwing petrol bombs and vandalizing government buildings. The symbols of the country insulted and humiliated. Local authorities overwhelmed and in need of assistance. This is the picture consumers of Chinese state media have been receiving of the Hong Kong protests, now approaching their 11th consecutive weekend. While there is some truth to it -- there have been numerous incidents of violence, and protesters have targeted Chinese flags and government buildings -- it remains a highly selective and incomplete take. Crucially, it appears to distort the reasons behind the unrest. Protests were initially sparked by opposition to a now-shelved extradition bill, but have since expanded to include demands for an investigation into police brutality and long-running calls for greater democracy and political reform. It also ignores the many peaceful marches and the reciprocal, seemingly self-perpetuating cycle of violence, with both protesters and police deploying increasingly forceful tactics. While many Hong Kongers are concerned about the escalating violence, and many have been inconvenienced by transport shutdowns and other travel disruptions, there is little sense of danger in the city beyond the protest front lines, and it is certainly far from the war zone often depicted in Chinese state media. The presentation of the protests in mainland China -- where propaganda combines with the vast online censorship apparatus of the Great Firewall to allow the government to construct a narrative of its choosing -- has evolved significantly over the past two months. Initially, almost all mention of the protests was censored, as is usual for anti-government action anywhere in China. Stories that did appear played up local support for the now-shelved extradition law, and framed opposition to it as a minority. As the movement evolved, however, so too did Chinese state media coverage. Violent clashes between police and protesters, beginning on June 12 when crowds effectively shut down the city's legislature and police cleared them with heavy force, were given sudden prominence and distributed widely. A one one-sided narrative was constructed in which protesters, now labeled ""violent mobs,"" were solely responsible for the escalating conflict. This was soon joined by allegations -- including from senior Chinese officials -- that Washington and other foreign governments were ""meddling"" in the protests and using them as a vehicle to attack China. As the protests continued, violent mobs became ""criminals"" and ""separatists,"" pursuing not greater democracy or an investigation into police violence, as they have demanded publicly, but Hong Kong independence. On Monday, this gradual rhetorical escalation reached a new stage, with Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, China's top body in charge of affairs in the city, saying the protests showed ""signs of terrorism."" ""Hong Kong's radical demonstrators have repeatedly attacked police officers with extremely dangerous tools,"" he said. ""They have already constituted serious violent crimes and have begun to show signs of terrorism. This is a gross violation of the rule of law and social order in Hong Kong, which is endangering the lives and safety for Hong Kong citizens."" On the same day, amid images of chaos coming out of Hong Kong's paralyzed international airport, Chinese state media broadcast images of the People's Armed Police (PAP) conducting drills in the neighboring mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen, in an apparent message to a domestic audience that the force stood poised to assist in crushed the protests. Some videos included subtitles highlighting relevant Chinese law that the PAP, which is under the direct control of the Central Military Commission headed by President Xi Jinping, can be used to ""handle riots, unrest, severe violent criminal activities, terrorist attacks and other public safety incidents."" Worrying signal Lev Nachman, an expert in social movements in Hong Kong and Taiwan at the University of California, Irvine, said that while Yang's use of the caveat ""signs of terrorism,"" rather than outright saying protesters were terrorists, was something of a silver lining, it suggested ""harsh repression by the regime is now no longer off the table, especially if protests continue."" ""Evoking terrorism is rhetorical groundwork for escalation, it gives the Communist Party room to continue down this loaded line of 'terrorism' discourse that has the potential to justify whatever violence they deem necessary to stop whatever the 'terrorist' threat is,"" he said. ""It almost feels like a threat from Yang Guang to the protesters that they are approaching a level of disruption that the (Party) no longer finds acceptable."" Under Hong Kong's de facto constitution, the government can request the assistance of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) garrison in the city for the ""maintenance of public order."" However, experts agree that the deployment of the military to the streets of Hong Kong could massively backfire on the government, leading to comparisons to the Tiananmen Square crackdown of 1989 and potentially crashing the economy. For its part, the Hong Kong government seemed to downplay China's descriptions of the protests, with Senior Superintendent Steve Li saying ""based on the current situation, we will handle it as violent protest."" Previously, local officials have also distanced themselves from Chinese propaganda about foreign forces controlling the protests. A senior Hong Kong government official told CNN they had ""no evidence"" of overseas interference, and pointed to local concerns as the chief driver of the protests. Chinese state media, on the other hand, took the terrorism line and ran with it. State broadcaster CCTV accused protesters of attempting to murder police and said the unrest ""obviously has the color of terrorism"" which required the government to ""resolutely crack down."" Official news agency Xinhua played up comments by an official in Hong Kong that the city risked sliding ""into a bottomless abyss if the terror atrocities are allowed to continue,"" while an editorial in the nationalist tabloid Global Times said ""raging mobs"" must be ""receiving support through nefarious political gain or financial stimulation"" and were ""without any doubt, similar to terrorists."" Yaqiu Wang, a researcher with Human Rights Watch, said the terrorism framing was ""extremely concerning."" She pointed to the use of ""vaguely and broadly defined 'terrorism' charges"" to justify widespread repression in Xinjiang, a region in northwest China with a large Muslim minority. Beijing has been accused of running a huge network of detention camps in Xinjiang, with potentially millions of mostly Uyghur Muslims being processed for ""re-education."" Uyghurs have been the chief target of the ""terrorist"" designation in China, part of a general othering of the non-ethnically Chinese minority which has gone hand in hand with greater repression in the region. Suggesting that Hong Kongers, almost all of whom are Han Chinese, are also terrorists would be a major shift in how Beijing views the city and its relationship to the Chinese metropole. The World Uyghur Congress, a Germany-based NGO highly critical of China, also said it was ""tremendously concerning"" that the government was using the term terrorism with regard to Hong Kong. However, Wang noted that ""the contexts of Hong Kong and Xinjiang are vastly different, to launch a 'Xinjiang-style' crackdown in Hong Kong would be hard to do and very costly to Beijing, for reasons such as Hong Kong is a major financial center in Asia and the residents are very digitally connected."" ""The extraordinary activism demonstrated by Hong Kong people in the past three months has shown their resolve and competence in defending their freedoms and rights,"" she said. ""Beijing should take note of that."" This story has been updated."	CNN
102	https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/13/politics/trump-hong-kong-protests-china-troops/index.html	Updated 6:30 PM ET, Tue August 13, 2019	Trump hopes 'nobody gets killed' as Hong Kong protests escalate	"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump addressed the escalating situation in Hong Kong Tuesday, saying US intelligence indicates ""the Chinese Government is moving troops to the Border,"" but security officials tell CNN that Beijing regularly maintains a force presence there. ""Our Intelligence has informed us that the Chinese Government is moving troops to the Border with Hong Kong. Everyone should be calm and safe!"" Trump tweeted after landing in Pittsburgh for an event on manufacturing. Trump has come under criticism for saying very little about Hong Kong's protests and appearing, instead, to focus more intently on his hopes for a trade deal with Beijing. The demonstrations on Tuesday turned violent after protestors shut down the airport and clashed with riot police, raising fears that Beijing may be moving closer to considering force. China regularly maintains a troop presence near the Hong Kong border. Trump's tweet about military movements was likely referring to the current US assessment that China has positioned some mobile forces along the border at what appear to be potential staging locations, according to multiple officials. Several officials noted that the troop presence has been widely observed and publicly reported on in recent days. Tuesday marked the second day that protesters gathering at Hong Kong's airport prompted flight cancellations. But the demonstrations have a much longer history: Protests kicked off in earnest in June to oppose to a now-shelved bill that would have allowed Hong Kong to extradite individuals to mainland China. This week Amnesty International said Hong Kong police have violated human rights by using gas, rubber bullets and pepper ball projectiles on the protestors in confined spaces. Chinese officials have accused the US and other foreign governments of being behind the pro-democracy protests. The US has denied any role and Trump also appeared to reject the suggestion Tuesday when he tweeted that ""many are blaming me, and the United States, for the problems going on in Hong Kong. I can't imagine why?"" 'Hope nobody gets killed' The President's tweet about Chinese troops came shortly after he characterized the unrest in Hong Kong as a ""tough situation,"" and told reporters that he hopes the situation will work out ""for everybody, including China."" As scenes of chaos played out on television of protesters and riot police scuffling at Hong Kong International Airport, Trump also told reporters in New Jersey that his wish is for the situation to work out ""for liberty,"" adding, ""I hope nobody gets hurt, I hope nobody gets killed."" A senior administration official says the ""United States continues to monitor the situation in Hong Kong, and we urge all sides to remain calm, safe, and peaceful."" ""As the President has said: 'they're looking for democracy and I think most people want democracy.' Freedoms of expression and assembly are core values that we share with the people of Hong Kong and these freedoms should be protected,"" the official added. ""The United States firmly rejects the notion that we are sponsoring or inciting the demonstrations,"" the official said, echoing Trump's earlier tweet. Another senior administration official told CNN Tuesday that the US believes if China were to intervene militarily in the protests it would likely be because the Beijing had assessed that the Hong Kong's authorities have lost control. The official said losing control could be defined as the interference of commercial activity in Hong Kong. In the US, surveys taken after the violent suppression of protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989 showed public approval for China dropped dramatically, particularly among people under 30 and has never recovered, the official said, suggesting that Chinese military intervention in Hong Kong is not a good idea. If China does intervene militarily, Congress will explode and there will be negative consequences, the official added. However, multiple US officials also told CNN that troop movement near the Hong Kong border is a tactic they expected from Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is laying the groundwork, they say, in case intervention is needed. Xi is also preparing for that possibility by tailoring his message to the Chinese public with news reports focused on unrest and violence so that if Beijing does intervene, the move will not come as a shock to the mainland audience. Pushing a narrative of US and foreign support for the protesters could also allow Xi to justify intervention to the Chinese people. Yet for the moment, it appears Xi is still weighing the potential costs and benefits of intervening. US officials told CNN they are waiting to see if he will take the next step and order the Chinese military to begin breaking up protests before reacting. Several US officials told CNN that the hope is that China ultimately refrains from stepping in, noting the potential economic impact is a major concern, in addition to obvious security implications. T
he thinking among some US officials is that there is still a window for China to avoid intervention, but that would require authorities in Hong Kong to act or for locals who are not participating in the protests to begin applying social pressure on demonstrators to dial down tensions. In the meantime, it seems that US and Chinese officials are maintaining an open dialogue.

Follow him on Twitter @WorldAffairsPro. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his; view more opinions on CNN. (CNN)It was a scene none of us who have called Hong Kong home could have ever imagined: thousands of pro-democracy protesters occupying the arrivals level of Hong Kong International Airport, causing a shutdown of the facility Monday afternoon for all incoming and outgoing flights. The airport blockade capped one of the bloodiest weekends in modern Hong Kong history which saw police indiscriminately firing tear gas and rubber bullets in the confined spaces of the city's mass-transit railway stations. It's becoming a very ugly scene in one of the world's premier business and financial centers, with Beijing edging closer to intervening.  According to reports, at least nine civilians were injured in the protests. Disgusted by the uptick in police violence, thousands of Hong Kong residents traveled to the island airport to make their voices heard. On Tuesday, the conflict escalated as riot police deployed to the airport clashed with the demonstrators. Protesters tried to block police vehicles and paramedics struggled to gain access to the scene. Officers, including the special tactical squad, remain stationed outside the airport and the EU has urged restraint from ""all sides."" Livestream video from the airport showed protesters detaining and questioning a man suspected of being an undercover police officer -- a scene which will certainly rattle officials. The situation in Hong Kong is quickly spiraling out of control and the local administration appears increasingly unable to manage a crisis that is entirely of its own making. It started several months ago when Chief Executive Carrie Lam introduced a controversial extradition bill, which has since been suspended but not entirely withdrawn. The bill could see Hong Kong residents sent to China's notoriously politicized judicial system. Rather than defuse the situation with an offer of widespread public consultations on the bill and conciliatory language, Lam and her cronies have adopted a bunker mentality, communicating by intermittent press conferences and leaving the police to deal with the protesters and daily public messaging. A chaotic press conference on Tuesday, with Lam appearing frail but still resolute, failed in what could have been a last-ditch effort to convince protesters to go home. What makes a quick solution even more elusive is that over the past 10 weeks the demands of the protest movement, such as the introduction of universal suffrage, have widened far beyond what the government can offer. Signs with provocative slogans such as ""Liberate Hong Kong"" are now commonplace across the city. The mostly young protesters are focused on what might happen after the ""one country, two systems"" framework for Hong Kong, which allows it to have independent policing and legal systems, expires in 2047. What is astonishing is that, after almost three months of widespread disruptions and now daily protests, one would've expected protest fatigue to set in among Hong Kong residents, known for their pragmatism and work ethic. In fact, as the protests drag on and as heavy-handed police tactics circulate on TV and social media, funding campaigns have sprung up to provide support to protesters. That type of language reminds me of what I heard firsthand from pro-democracy protesters in Shanghai, shortly after the Chinese army cleared Tiananmen Square in 1989. While the crackdown brought a long economic slowdown to China, mostly due to international sanctions, the pain was considered tolerable by a regime that has zero tolerance for dissent. I now suspect Beijing is weighing its options on whether to risk a prolonged economic slowdown in Hong Kong in return for enforcing its will with military might. So what could happen next? The blockade of the airport, which contributes 5% to Hong Kong's GDP, threatens the viability of Hong Kong's main gateway and could be the trigger point for Beijing to act. Other than a military intervention, immediate options could include a temporary curfew, shutting down the mass-transit system at night, more sophisticated police tactics and an increased security cordon around the airport and other key installations. And with Lam seeming to lose her grip on Hong Kong, a Chinese-designated hardliner replacement might even be in the cards. Ordinarily the United States, which could easily punish China by lifting Hong Kong's special economic status for the city, could be counted on to encourage a peaceful resolution. But any goodwill Washington had has been expended by the Trump administration in its ongoing trade war with China. America's absence, coupled with President Donald Trump's lack of interest, creates a dangerous void. The incompetent handling of this crisis has caused permanent damage to Hong Kong's reputation as a stable international business center. Already influential investors, citing as well the impact of the trade war on Hong Kong, are signaling a turn towards safer havens. Uncertainty over the economy will certainly grow with each additional day of airport disruptions. The widely respected American investor Jim Rogers told me: ""Buy Shenzhen and Singapore."" Translation: it doesn't look good for Hong Kong.  Whatever happens next, we appear to have reached a point of no return. The Hong Kong government needs to offer concessions that will bring an end to weeks of crippling protests. But the central government -- in effect Hong Kong's landlords -- has no history of caving to protesters, especially when it comes to widening democratic rights. And with China's 70th national day approaching on October 1, authorities in Beijing will want to see the Hong Kong situation well sorted by then. Beijing, which is increasingly mimicking Russia's playbook, must have certainly taken note of how Russia forcibly annexed Crimea with relatively little pain. We can expect an increasingly assertive China to sanction a much heavier crackdown in Hong Kong while the world helplessly watches. "	CNN

Trade fears: Trade fears aren't going anywhere. US stock futures are lower after a rough start to the week. The Dow closed down nearly 400 points, or 1.5%, on Monday. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq fell 1.2%. Stocks in Asia followed suit on Tuesday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng tumbled 2.1% as protesters targeted the city's international airport for a second day. Japan's Nikkei fell 1.1%. In Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 shed 0.5% in early trading. Germany's DAX dropped 1% after the ZEW indicator of economic sentiment for August plunged. Nervous investors are piling into gold and ultra-safe government bonds. The 10-year US Treasury yield is below 1.7%, its lowest level in nearly three years. The 30-year Treasury yield is nearing an all-time low. 2. Singapore GDP: Singapore is headed for its weakest annual growth rate in a decade. It's blaming its troubles on the US-China trade war. The country warned Tuesday that economic growth could fall to 0% this year. Previously, it predicted its economy would grow by 1.5% to 2.5%. That kind of growth would be the worst since 2009, when Singapore's GDP contracted by 0.6%, according to the International Monetary Fund. The global growth outlook has weakened in part because of escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry said. A recession looks unavoidable for Singapore, Sian Fenner, lead Asian economist for Oxford Economics, wrote in a research note. 3. Argentina's rout: Emerging markets are back in the headlines after a surprise result in Argentina's primary election sent the country's currency and stocks plunging on Monday. The fear from investors: that populists could replace the country's current, business-friendly government.  The country's Merval index closed down 38% while the Argentine peso plummeted 15% against the dollar. In an already volatile moment, such massive losses are putting investors on edge. 4.

The city's largest airline outlined its ""zero tolerance"" approach in a memo sent days after Chinese authorities took steps to prevent Cathay workers who participate in protests from flying to mainland China or passing through the country's airspace. Cathay said that it would comply with that rule. ""It is important to remember that actions and words of our employees made outside of working hours can have a significant effect on the company,"" CEO Rupert Hogg told employees. The airline shared a copy of the memo with CNN. ""We have a high profile in the community given the nature of our business and inevitably actions of our employees frequently attract attention and would be treated as that representing the company's position,"" Hogg added. All flights departing Hong Kong were later canceled Monday because of massive protests at its international airport, according to a statement posted on Cathay's website. Cathay cited a directive from the Hong Kong International Airport Authority. China's Civil Aviation Administration said Friday that it would ban Cathay employees who support or take part in ""illegal demonstrations, protests and violent attacks, as well as those who have had radical behaviors"" from working on flights in China's airspace. The agency also said it will require Cathay to submit identification details about all relevant crews for approval prior to takeoff. Hogg had told employees on Saturday that the company is legally required to comply with China's aviation authority. He wrote that workers who partake in such actions will be ""immediately suspended"" from any flights or ""air transportation"" activity involving mainland China. The chief executive also pointed out that China is key to the airline's business. Cathay not only flies in and out of mainland China — it also has a ""large number of routes"" to Europe and the United States that pass through that airspace. Cathay Pacific is based in Hong Kong, which though a part of China is governed under a separate legal framework granting the city certain political and legal freedoms not available on the mainland. There have now been 10 consecutive weekends of protests in the financial hub, where demonstrators are calling for greater democracy, an independent investigation into alleged police brutality and the resignation of the city's leader, Carrie Lam. Clashes between protestors and police have in some cases involved tear gas and resulted in injuries. ""Our primary focus must remain on delivering a safe, comfortable customer experience for everyone who chooses to fly with us,"" Hogg wrote in his memo on Saturday. ""At the same time, we always try to create a safe, supportive environment for all Cathay Pacific Group employees. Though people may share different views, it is essential that we all respect each other, our customers and members of the public."" The company also said that by Thursday it will provide a report to China's Civil Aviation Administration on actions taken to improve flight safety and security, per the agency's request. On the same day that Cathay announced it would comply with China's aviation authority, the airline also confirmed that it removed a pilot from duty last month who had been arrested during one of the protests. ""Cathay Pacific wishes to make it clear that we express no view whatsoever on the subject matter of any proceedings to which he may be subject,"" the company said. Cathay (CPCAY) flies about 34 million passengers every year and serves nearly 200 cities around the world from its hub at Hong Kong's international airport. But its business has suffered because of the city's political crisis. The airline was forced to cancel more than 150 flights last week amid a day of mass demonstrations and strikes. And the international airport was the site of a three-day sit in. The company's stock was down about 4.5% on Monday. It has lost more than 11% this month."	CNN

Aramco's first look: Saudi Aramco said Monday that its profit dropped 12% in the first half of its financial year to $46.9 billion due to weaker global oil prices. The rare financial disclosure coincides with renewed interest in a potential initial public offering by Saudi Arabia's state oil producer, and bolsters its status as the world's most profitable company. Apple (AAPL), for comparison, generated profit of $31.5 billion in the first six months of its financial year. Aramco has been more public about its finances recently as Saudi officials consider whether to list shares in the company in order to fund projects that could wean the economy off its addiction to oil. An IPO that was planned for 2018 never materialized. A lack of transparency over the size of the country's energy reserves had caused skepticism about the potential sale and the value of Aramco. But plans for a public listing as early as next year are now being accelerated following positive investor reaction to a bond sale in April, according to the Wall Street Journal. 2. Hong Kong protests: As protests in Hong Kong escalate, the ramifications for businesses and travelers are growing. The Hong Kong International Airport Authority has canceled all flights scheduled to depart the major travel hub Monday evening because of a mass demonstration. Flights bound for Hong Kong that have not yet taken off were also canceled. Shares in Hong Kong's flagship airline, Cathay Pacific (CPCAY), were already down almost 5% on Monday. The company said over the weekend it would cooperate with a directive from China's aviation authority that banned staff from flying to, from and over mainland China if they participate in or support the protests. An internal memo sent by CEO Rupert Hogg to staff on Monday warned that the carrier has ""has a zero tolerance approach to illegal activities."" 3. BlackRock deal: BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager, has cut a flashy deal as part of its push into private equity. The company said over the weekend that it had made a $875 million investment in Authentic Brands, the company that owns Sports Illustrated, Nine West and Juicy Couture. That makes it the company's largest shareholder. The investment is the first for BlackRock's new private-equity fund, Long Term Private Capital, which the company said in April was ready to start investing after securing $2.75 billion. 4. Global market overview: US stock futures point lower as investors turn their attention to the protests in Hong Kong. The Dow is set to open down 100 points, or 0.4%. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are set to fall a similar amount. European markets were largely lower in early trading. Britain's FTSE 100 and France's CAC 40 both shed 0.2%. Germany's DAX rose 0.1%. Stocks in Asia were mixed. Hong Kong's Hang Seng finished down 0.2%, and the Shanghai Composite rose 1.5%. The Dow closed down 0.3% on Friday. The S&P 500 shed 0.7%, and the Nasdaq declined 1%.

108	https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/11/asia/hong-kong-fake-news-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 7:47 PM ET, Sun August 11, 2019	Hong Kong isn't just battling on the streets: There is also a war on misinformation online	"(CNN)It's a viscerally emotive picture. A woman who appears to be pregnant lies on the floor of a subway station. It was taken on July 21, after a mob attack in the Yuen Long district of Hong Kong left at least 45 people injured -- including the woman, a civilian who had been caught up in the attack and became known locally as ""the woman in white"" or ""big belly lady,"" slang for ""pregnant lady"" in Cantonese. On social media, posts alleging that she had suffered a miscarriage were shared thousands of times. As more footage emerged, public outrage intensified over the Yuen Long violence, and towards the police for their alleged failure to protect victims from the baton-wielding attackers, who appeared to target protesters returning home from a march. But then came the counternarrative. She wasn't pregnant, people claimed, and her alleged miscarriage was a politically motivated rumor. Though local media claim to have confirmed her pregnancy and the safety of the baby, the truth remains contested. Either way, the incident clearly illustrates the power of unverified online rumors to shape the narrative driving the city's worst political crisis in decades. Mass protests began more than two months ago over a controversial bill which would allow residents to be extradited to face trial in mainland China. The bill has since been shelved, but the uproar stoked a wider civil unrest that shows no sign of abating. On the streets, protesters and police face off each week with escalating violence. Online, an equally bitter battle is being waged using the weapon of misinformation. Just like the protests and clashes, fake news is threatening Hong Kongers' unity and safety -- and there is no end to it in sight. How fake news spread and spiraled In Hong Kong, there's virtually no way to avoid misinformation. In the subway, fake news is anonymously AirDropped onto commuters' phones. Rumors and speculation posted by both individuals and local blogs are plastered over Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and shared on messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram. Their controversial content is the topic of daily conversation citywide. The rumors that take hold often prey on pre-existing fears and paranoia -- and are just believable enough to work. ""We all have a cognitive tendency to believe what we want to believe and dismiss what we don't want to believe, without any evidence that suggests what is true and what is not,"" said Masato Kajimoto, a journalism professor at Hong Kong University, who specializes in misinformation. In one viral tweet, for example, an unverified user warned the Chinese military was about to cross the Hong Kong-Shenzhen border to wage a Tiananmen Square-style crackdown, with an accompanying video of tanks at a train station. But a station sign in the video reads ""Longyan"" -- which is not in Shenzhen, and likely refers to a city in Fujian province, hundreds of miles away. Fact-checkers online pointed this out, but it was too late -- the video has now been viewed more than 848,000 times and has more than 8,000 retweets. The tweet tapped into a powerful fear that underlies the ongoing political crisis -- that Beijing is encroaching on the unique freedoms of this semi-autonomous Chinese city. As a former British colony, Hong Kong enjoys protected freedoms of speech, press, and assembly, as decreed when Britain handed the city back to China in a model of governance called ""one country, two systems."" Now, young protesters feel like they're running out of time to achieve full democracy before the looming deadline of 2047, when Hong Kong is set to become fully reintegrated with Xi Jinping's authoritarian mainland China. To many, it doesn't matter that Hong Kong officials have called rumors of Chinese military deployment ""totally unfounded."" Once the rumors begin -- even if proved fake -- they sow lingering seeds of mistrust, especially towards the government, which protesters accuse of inaction and bending to Beijing's will. Narratives of Chinese intervention are ""actually from an old playbook,"" Kajimoto said. Similar rumors circulated in the 2014 Umbrella Revolution. Another long-standing rumor to have reemerged is that of US interference in the protests. Elaborate conspiracy maps have circulated among those who oppose the protests, purportedly showing how US government agencies are funding the protesters. Meanwhile, photographs have been shared of Caucasian men at the protests, labeled as secret CIA agents responsible for orchestrating the unrest. Even the mainland Chinese authorities have accused the US of influencing the protests. ""As you all know, they are somehow the work of the US,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said of the protests last week. Beijing has not yet provided any evidence to back these allegations -- but for many online, the photos of so-called CIA agents seem like proof enough. The cycle of mistrust and misinformation It's unclear where many of these rumors begin -- partisan groups, internet trolls, state actors? -- or whether they are just innocent mistakes. Tracing their origins would require a team of data researchers to monitor the influx of social media content, said Anne Kruger, an editor at First Draft, a non-profit that fights misinformation globally. But an organized fake news campaign is ""certainly a possibility,"" she said, adding there have been some telltale signs of this. Kruger has observed pro-Beijing accounts popping up on Twitter with zero followers, seemingly set up to send death threats to pro-Hong Kong protest leaders in Australia, where Kruger is based. ""That signals to me a campaign -- but how organized it is, is hard to say,"" Kruger said. One thing seems clear -- in an already divided society, misinformation and polarization are feeding off each other in a vicious, self-perpetuating cycle. Misinformation itself is ""a manifestation of polarized society,"" said Kajimoto. ""The political division is the very reason why many people are believing, sharing and spreading manipulated content to begin with."" The reason division breeds fake news is simple, said Kajimoto -- people believe what they want to believe, and dismiss what they don't want to believe, regardless of the evidence. This is especially true in times of crisis, when people cling to their beliefs more tightly in the face of opposition and threat. At the same time, misinformation is deepening an ideological rift that has existed for years. With violent clashes becoming the new normal, the Hong Kong protests are turning parents against children, friends against friends, the youth against the government, and civilians against police. This polarization isn't limited to individuals: it has also fed a growing perception that local media outlets are biased either for or against the protesters. Many young Hong Kongers, like 21-year-old Ava Leung, gravitate towards news sites like Stand News and Apple Daily, which are typically more sympathetic to the protest movement. Meanwhile, those who oppose the protests -- for example, Leung's parents -- tend to rely on broadcasters like TVB, which she characterizes as pro-Beijing and ""not accurate."" This declining faith in the objectivity of local news media has, in turn, led people to rely more on social media for their news, opening up space for online rumors and misinformation to spread. Some are aware of the danger of misinformation and take precautions -- several young Hong Kongers interviewed for this piece said that when they read rumors online, they cross-check claims with a variety of local and foreign media coverage, try to locate the information source and spread the word if something is found to be false. ""From my heart, I want to find the truth, to tell people what is true. Even the people by my side -- I don't want rumors or untrue things to affect us,"" said Mixe Lee, a flight attendant from Hong Kong. ""The environment and the atmosphere are already very serious, so it's very important to clarify if things are correct or not."" Chrysilla Joy Villanueva, a 21-year-old student, said she never reposts information without verifying it first, and urges others to fact-check online rumors. But not everybody is as cautious. People often share misinformation ""without even giving it a thought,"" Villanueva said. ""That's the thing with social media now. If people send stuff like this, you instantly believe it."" A city shadowed by fear In Hong Kong, as is the case worldwide, misinformation online can result in consequences beyond ideological confusion. One video that went viral on Facebook shows a Caucasian man at a July 14 protest moving his hand along his lower torso. The post claimed the ""secret hand signal"" proved he was an undercover foreign agent. The video, hashtagged #CIA, has been viewed over 40,600 times. The man, in fact, is a well-known Twitter user who said the ""hand signals"" had been him pulling his sweaty shirt from his body -- but the damage had been done. The furor had reached his employer, he said, potentially jeopardizing his job. The rumors are also threatening people's physical safety and sense of security. For instance, some people online have speculated that criminal gangs, known in Hong Kong as triads, had hired members of ethnic minorities to attack protesters in Yuen Long. Ethnic minorities, particularly those with darker skin, already face a certain amount of prejudice in Hong Kong -- now, some feel they are being viewed with greater suspicion. ""I'm already afraid of going outside -- especially now that the rumor came out,"" said Villanueva, who is of Filipino descent. As a young woman, she doesn't look much like a hired thug -- but with heightened racial tensions, she fears possible public confrontations. ""I get stares from locals,"" she said. ""I feel like I have to be careful out there even though we've done nothing -- we just look different."" Misinformation experts like Kruger are bracing for a potential escalation in the online rumors, which would see the posts not simply report news but also include ""calls for action and retaliation."" This has already happened to deadly effect elsewhere. India saw a spate of mob killings in 2018, sparked by rumors of child abduction on WhatsApp. In some cases, the victims were lynched by crowds of almost 3,000 people. Meanwhile in Myanmar, misinformation fed alleged genocide. Hatemongering Facebook posts and viral fake photos targeted the Rohingya Muslim minority, who were persecuted in what the UN calls ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing."" Online rumors have also spawned real violence even in the United States -- take Pizzagate, the infamous 2016 case where a man fired a rifle inside a Washington D.C. pizzeria because of an online hoax that claimed the pizzeria was running a pedophilia ring that somehow involved Hillary Clinton. There is no suggestion that Hong Kong is at imminent risk of this kind of fatal, mass violence -- but Kruger warns that with ""heightened emotion"" across the city, ""nobody is acting in a calm manner and that's the danger."" The way forward As the rumor-driven killings in India and elsewhere have shown, misinformation -- and the violence it incites -- is a global problem. Countries and companies worldwide are responding. Governments in Australia, Nigeria, Canada, to name a few, are carrying out public awareness and media literacy campaigns, teaching people how to spot and avoid fake news. Many of these tactics include measures described by Villanueva and Lee, including cross-checking with other outlets and staying wary of sensationalist headlines. Meanwhile, some countries like India and Sri Lanka have resorted to shutting down the internet at times to halt the spread of fake messages. Facebook has launched an anti-misinformation campaign, tweaking site features to limit the reach of fake news and hiring fact-checking moderators around the world. WhatsApp has also introduced new anti-misinformation features, including limiting the number of times messages can be forwarded. But significant change has to come from the ground up, starting with public education on spotting fake news, said Kruger, who has pushed for mandatory media and news literacy programs in schools in the Asia Pacific region. Until then, the public should simply exercise more caution and take news with a grain of salt. ""If something looks not really verified, they should simply ignore it. Don't give any oxygen to it and amplify the message,"" said Kajimoto. ""If that information or rumor still goes viral and many people are discussing it, then journalists or other concerned citizen groups will start investigating it; sooner or later, they will find out if the story is true or not. Most people can wait until then."" "	CNN
109	https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/asia/us-travel-advisory-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 5:36 AM ET, Thu August 8, 2019	United States becomes latest country to issue travel advisory over Hong Kong protests	"Hong Kong (CNN)The United States has become the latest country to issue a travel warning over Hong Kong's ongoing protests, which have at times turned violent and seen parts of the city brought to a standstill. The Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs issued a travel advisory Wednesday, urging travelers to exercise increased caution over the protests. ""Most have been peaceful, but some have turned confrontational or resulted in violent clashes,"" the advisory said. ""These demonstrations, which can take place with little or no notice, are likely to continue."" The advisory warned those visiting Hong Kong to avoid demonstrations, keep a low profile and exercise caution if unexpectedly in the vicinity of large gatherings or protests. Similar warnings have been issued by other countries including Australia, United Kingdom, Ireland, Japan and Singapore. Although the warnings recommend travelers exercise a high degree of caution, countries are not yet advising visitors to avoid Hong Kong altogether. For the past nine weeks, Hong Kong has been rocked by large-scale and sometimes violent protests that were sparked by a now-shelved bill that would have allowed people in the city to be extradited to China. The demonstrations -- which have shown no sign of abating -- have evolved to include a range of demands, including greater democracy and an inquiry into alleged police brutality. Although the protests initially followed planned routes in central Hong Kong, a range of areas around the city are now being impacted -- including places where protesters have not gained permission to demonstrate. On Monday, widespread strikes and protests throughout the city saw more than 220 flights canceled and major subway lines around the city suspended or delayed. In the afternoon, clashes broke out between protesters and police, with police firing tear gas in five districts. There have also been instances of people being attacked by mobs. Last month, a group wielding iron bars and bamboo sticks attacked people at a Hong Kong metro station. Police reportedly took almost an hour to arrive, and at least 45 people were injured, some seriously. In a statement Thursday, the Hong Kong government said that although recent incidents may have caused inconvenience to travelers, many of city's travel agents, hotels, and business organizations were making arrangements to minimize future disruption to visitors. ""Hong Kong remains a welcoming city for tourists and travelers from around the world,"" a government spokesman said. ""The impact of these illegal confrontations is confined to a limited area near the procession routes, and is not widespread."" Figures suggest the ongoing protests are impacting tourism. Between June 16 and July 13, during which time there were several huge demonstrations, flight bookings to Hong Kong from Asia fell by 5.4% on the same period last year, according to analysis firm ForwardKeys. Before the protests kicked off, the city had been enjoying a 6.6% rise in flight bookings in the first six months of 2019, compared to the same period of 2018. However, in the past few weeks bookings had picked up slightly, the research firm found. Tourists have posted pictures on social media of themselves in front of the countless Lennon Walls that have sprung up around the city, where protesters display art and Post-it notes with inspirational messages. And despite the warnings, the Hong Kong Tourism Commission said the city is still open to travelers. The ""vast majority of people taking part in processions do so in a peaceful and orderly manner,"" Jeanne Tam, from the Tourism Commission, said in a statement. ""Processions only affect certain parts of the city for a defined period of time ... (and) are publicized well in advance,"" Tam added."	CNN

El Paso mass shooting One weekend. Two shootings. 29 people dead. Welcome to America in 2019. The nation is reeling from a pair of mass shootings and once again grappling with what to do about the plague of gun violence. The first happened Saturday at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. A gunman  -- who police say had posted a racist, anti-immigrant ""manifesto"" online -- killed at least 20 people and injured 26 others. The store was packed with families searching for back-to-school deals. It took police six minutes to respond after the first reports of an active shooter were called in. When they arrived on the scene, the suspect got out of his vehicle unarmed and just walked over to them. He's been arrested and charged with capital murder. Federal authorities are treating the shooting as a case of domestic terrorism, and the gunman could face the death penalty. It's one of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in US history.  2. Dayton mass shooting We all went to bed Saturday night trying to process the senselessness of the Texas shooting, only to wake up to another horror: another mass shooting. This one happened just 13 hours later in an entertainment district in Dayton, Ohio. A gunman wearing body armor approached the outside of a bar and opened fire. He killed nine people -- including his own sister -- and injured at least 31 others in a shooting that lasted less than a minute. Police officers on patrol nearby rushed over and killed the shooter. Authorities say they've found writings indicating the gunman had an interest in killing people. His classmates said he had a ""hit list."" A preliminary assessment of the writings did not indicate any racial or political motive. President Trump later weighed in, telling reporters that, ""Hate has no place in our country,"" and that ""perhaps more has to be done"" to address gun violence. The President has used incendiary language at rallies across the country; many Democrats and others on the left say his political rhetoric is fueling an atmosphere that emboldens white supremacists to commit acts of violence. Trump will address the nation this morning at 10 a.m. ET, but it's unclear if he will announce any concrete proposals to fight gun violence.

Just last night protesters swarmed Causeway Bay on Hong Kong Island and blocked key roads. Police responded with tear gas. Now the political unrest is rushing into the work week. A huge day of strikes and protests is set to happen today. Major sectors of Hong Kong will likely grind to a halt since people of all kinds -- like teachers, finance employees, civil servants -- are poised to take part in the demonstrations, which have gone on since June over a now-suspended extradition bill. Already more than 100 flights have been canceled or delayed. Click here to keep up with the latest on the unrest in Hong Kong. 4. Iran Looks like the tensions with Iran won't be deescalating anytime soon. Iran says it seized a foreign oil tanker last week it claimed was smuggling fuel to the Arab states. The ship has seven crew members. It's not clear at this point what the nationalities of the ship and crew are. Iran's seizure last month of two tankers -- one Panamanian-flagged and one British -- marked an escalation in the standoff between the Islamic Republic and Western powers after President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal last year. 5. Sudan Better news may be on the horizon in Sudan. An agreement was reached over the weekend between Sudanese opposition groups and the Sudan Transitional Military Council on a final Constitutional Declaration. That should finally clear the way for eventual civilian rule in the country, which has been run by the military ever since President Omar al-Bashir was pushed out in a military coup earlier this year. Sudanese citizens then protested the military and demanded it hand power over to a civilian-led body. The military responded with a bloody crackdown on a pro-democracy sit-in that left 118 people dead. But now the two sides hope to work out the details for a ceremony to sign the new constitutional declaration. BREAKFAST BROWSE Beautiful beat She lost her precious, 2-year-old son in a tragedy.

113	https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/01/asia/hong-kong-china-pla-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 3:22 AM ET, Thu August 1, 2019	Hong Kong protests: Head of China's military garrison condemns violence	"Hong Kong (CNN)The commander of the Chinese military garrison in Hong Kong has addressed the city's ongoing protest movement for the first time, warning that violence by pro-democracy groups ""should not be tolerated."" Speaking during a reception in the city to celebrate the 92nd anniversary of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), Maj. Gen. Chen Daoxiang said the garrison resolutely supported the Hong Kong government and its judiciary system ""and for them to punish those violent criminals according to law."" His comments come a day after 44 people, including more than a dozen students, were charged with rioting after an unlawful protest Sunday spiraled into violence and brought parts of the city to a standstill. The youngest person charged is aged 16. ""Recently, there have been a series of violent incidents happening in Hong Kong,"" said Chen in front of an audience that included the city's Chief Executive, Carrie Lam. ""The incidents have seriously violated the bottom line of 'one country, two systems.' This should not be tolerated and we express our strong condemnation,"" said the PLA commander, referring to the framework under which the semi-autonomous city is governed. The garrison marked the anniversary with the release of a video showing PLA soldiers storming a Hong Kong-style street, complete with traditional Chinese characters and a Hong Kong taxi. In one scene, military police with riot shields and warning banners similar to those used by Hong Kong police in the recent protests are seen marching in unison and shooting tear gas. A soldier is shown shouting in Cantonese, the primary language spoken in Hong Kong: ""All consequences are at your own risk."" The video was posted on the social media accounts of the Chinese government-run tabloid, the Global Times, along with the caption: ""A blunt warning to Hong Kong secessionists and their foreign backers?"" The comments from the military commander may heighten concerns among some protest groups that the Chinese government could use PLA troops to restore order in the city. At a Chinese Defense Ministry briefing on July 24, spokesman Wu Qian responded to questions about a possible PLA deployment by telling journalists to read article 14 of the Hong Kong garrison law. It states if the Hong Kong government requests PLA assistance ""in maintenance of public order"" then the garrison's troops can enter the streets of the city. Fears over PLA involvement There are at least 6,000 PLA troops stationed at the garrison in northern Hong Kong, close to the border with mainland China. Although Hong Kong is a Chinese city, the PLA troops are not involved in its every day security. Since its handover in 1997, Hong Kong has been governed under a separate set of laws allowing greater economic and personal freedoms for its citizens. On Tuesday, a senior Trump administration official said that there were rumors of Chinese police massing along the Hong Kong border, but didn't say if this was due to the protests or even whether the US government had confirmed it. There has so far been no firm indication that the PLA is planning to move outside its garrison, or that Beijing has any desire to deploy troops to the city. Analysts said that the Chinese government would be reluctant to deploy the PLA due to the potential economic and social instability that a military presence might spark. Hong Kong is a major global financial hub in which numerous major Chinese companies have important holdings. But that hasn't stopped number of pro-Beijing politicians in the city making it clear that it remains an active option. Speaking to camera in Mandarin, rather than the usual Hong Kong Cantonese, lawmaker Junius Ho said if Hong Kong reaches an ""uncontrollable state, we will deal with the situation."" ""In an emergency, if local police fail to maintain the order of Hong Kong, the PLA can intervene to bring back peace and stabilize the political situation in Hong Kong as per the law,"" he said in the video. In a letter to the Financial Times, former pro-Beijing Hong Kong Chief Executive CY Leung said that the PLA garrison in Hong Kong ""is not meant to be token, ceremonial or symbolic."" Leung was the city's leader during the Hong Kong Umbrella Movement protests when huge numbers of pro-democracy protesters paralyzed the city by taking over entire streets."	CNN
114	https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/31/asia/us-china-hong-kong-interference-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 9:42 PM ET, Wed July 31, 2019	China is blaming the US for the Hong Kong protests. Can that really be true?	"Hong Kong (CNN)The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Tuesday accused the United States of influencing the increasingly violent pro-democracy protests that have rocked Hong Kong for two months. ""As you all know, they are somehow the work of the US,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a press conference in Beijing. Hua added that China would ""never allow any foreign forces"" to interfere in the semi-autonomous city, and warned that ""those who play (with) fire will only get themselves burned."" The comments are one of the most direct accusations Beijing has so far made of US interference in Hong Kong politics, and follow months of speculation inside China that Western forces have had a hand in the movement. Protesters have been seen waving American flags at some of the demonstrations. Chinese state media has run multiple editorials blaming the US for the chaos. The state-run tabloid Global Times alleged Monday that there had been ""unprecedented levels of contact"" between Hong Kong pro-democracy leaders and Western governments. ""It is an open secret in Hong Kong that the forces protesting the extradition bill have been sponsored by the US,"" the paper said. North Korea has also leveled such claims at the US. In an editorial on Friday, state-run media Rodong Sinmun claimed the protests were the ""outcome of a plot hatched by the US and other Western countries."" However, neither country has provided any evidence for its allegations. At the press conference, Hua only made reference to public meetings between well-known Hong Kong pro-democracy leaders and US politicians. In a statement to CNN, the US State Department initially called Beijing's claims a ""ridiculous statement."" ""It is not credible to think that millions of people are being manipulated to stand for a free and open society,"" the statement said. However, the department spokesperson later revised the statement to take a more diplomatic stance. ""We categorically reject the charge of foreign forces as being behind the protests,"" the updated statement said. 'The US black hand' Hong Kong's summer of discontent was initially sparked by a controversial bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China. While Hong Kong is part of China, it is governed under a separate political system that allows for greater freedom of speech and rule of law. Protesters were concerned the extradition bill would undermine the city's special freedoms. That bill has since been suspended, but mass protests have continued and broadened in scope with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets over a range of issues, according to police and demonstrators, including greater democracy for Hong Kong, the resignation of the city's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, and an inquiry into police brutality. The demonstrations have grown more frequent and violent. In two back-to-back protests last weekend, police attempted to clear large crowds with rubber bullets and tear gas, while protesters pushed a flaming cart at police. Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said there was a ""long-standing tradition"" of Beijing blaming external forces during domestic demonstrations or unrest. ""Chinese officials have been telling US officials that they know the US black hand is behind the protests,"" she said. After the pro-democracy Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, Beijing accused the US of encouraging the unrest. ""It's pretty typical of how the Chinese describe outside interference, but it's also convenient as it supports a narrative about the evil West trying to undermine China's national rejuvenation,"" Glaser said. Little evidence There is no evidence of US involvement in the Hong Kong protests. However Washington has been linked to other countries' politics in the past. Declassified documents in 2011 revealed that the 1953 overthrow of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh was ""carried out under CIA direction as an act of US foreign policy."" Decades later, in 2018, US officials met in secret with Venezuelan military officers plotting a coup against President Nicolas Maduro, but Washington ultimately decided against supporting their cause, a current and a former US official told CNN. Hua noted Tuesday that top Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence, had meetings with ""opposition personnel"" in July. Both men publicly met Hong Kong pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai. It isn't clear, however, whether Beijing genuinely believes the US -- and the West more broadly -- is behind the protests, or if the claim is propaganda. ""It is a lot easier to tell the outside world (that the US is interfering) than it is to admit the Chinese might have some serious problems in their relationship with Hong Kong and with how the people of Hong Kong view the mainland,"" Glaser said."

115	https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/30/asia/hong-kong-protesters-charged-riot-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 2:30 AM ET, Wed July 31, 2019	Girl, 16, among 44 people charged with rioting in Hong Kong protests	"Hong Kong (CNN)Hong Kong police have charged 44 people, including more than a dozen students, with rioting after an illegal protest Sunday spiraled into chaos and brought parts of the city to a standstill, amid a deepening political crisis that shows little signs of deescalating. They mark the first rioting charges pressed during the eight weeks of protests that have rocked the semi-autonomous Chinese city, and those found guilty face up to ten years in jail. The youngest person charged is a 16-year-old girl. A total of 43 of the 44 people charged with rioting appeared on Wednesday at the Eastern Magistrates' Court, where the judge granted them bail. One did not present herself at court as ordered. The judge issued an arrest warrant and she will no longer be eligible for bail. In a statement Tuesday, police accused pro-democracy protesters of ""peace-breaching acts"" and attacking police officers. ""They set up roadblocks by umbrellas, wooden planks, bamboo sticks and railings; pried up pavement bricks, demolished roadside fences, damaged street signs and lampposts as well as attacked police officers at scene with lethal weapons such as bricks and sharpened iron rods,"" the statement said. On Sunday, protesters defied police orders and left an authorized demonstration in Chater Gardens to march through the city center. Many of the protesters were wearing black, the adopted color of the protest movement, and headed for the Chinese government's Liaison Office in the west of the city. There, in a largely residential area, police and protesters clashed. Riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters, who set a cart on fire and pushed it in the direction of officers.  Because police authorization had not been given to march through the city, the protest became illegal the minute the demonstrators left Chater Gardens. Ventus Lau, 25, one of the organizers of Sunday's protest, called the police decision to outlaw the march through Hong Kong ""a serious threat to our freedom of expression in Hong Kong."" ""There's no rioters, there's only tyranny,"" is a popular slogan adopted by protesters in recent weeks. On Tuesday evening, as the city was lashed by a tropical storm, hundreds of people gathered outside the Kwai Chung police station in the New Territories, where police had charged some of Sunday's protesters. Police used pepper spray and batons as protestors threw objects and chanted: ""Release the arrested now."" There were also skirmishes outside the police station in Tin Shui Wai, near the suburb of Yuen Long on the border with China which has been the scene of violent mob attacks and police and protester clashes. Police said an active investigation had begun and further arrests were possible. In total, 49 protesters were arrested in relation to Sunday's violence, including 32 men and 17 women, aged between 16 and 41. A 24-year-old man was charged with possession of offensive weapons, while two men were released on bail pending further investigation, and two were temporarily released. One of the defendants charged with rioting was given an additional charge of assaulting a police officer. The defendants include a chef, a pilot, a nurse, an electrician, a construction worker, a teacher, several clerks and 14 students. Bail for the 44 was set at HK$1,000 ($127) and conditions demand that defendants remain under curfew from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m. and must report weekly to police stations. The cases have been divided into four trials to begin in September. More forceful response to protesters Mass protests have rocked the major global financial hub for eight consecutive weeks, triggered by a controversial -- and now-shelved -- bill that would have allowed extradition from the city to mainland China. Protesters' demands over that period have broadened to encompass issues such as greater democracy for the city, an inquiry into alleged police brutality, declassifying protests as riots, and the resignation of Chief Executive Carrie Lam. The demonstrations have also steadily escalated in terms of violence and rhetoric. Following an attack on protesters by a baton-wielding mob in Yuen Long subway station on July 21, which left 45 injured, police arrested six men, some of whom had links to crime gangs known as triads. Those men face the lesser charge of ""unlawful assembly."" The more serious rioting charge leveled against Sunday's protesters follows Beijing's public backing of the Hong Kong police and government. On Monday, the Chinese government accused pro-democracy protesters of committing ""evil and criminal acts"" that have seriously damaged the semi-autonomous city's ""reputation"" and ""stability."" At a press conference in Beijing, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office spokesman Yang Guang called the situation in Hong Kong ""grave,"" adding that Beijing would not allow any challenge to the Chinese government's authority or threats to national security. ""No civilization or society under the rule of law would ever allow acts of violence to take place. We call on the general public of Hong Kong to be aware of the grave nature of the current situation,"" Yang said, calling on Hong Kong citizens to condemn protester violence. ""Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong. Hong Kong's affairs are China's domestic affairs,"" he added. Hong Kong has been governed under a ""one country, two systems"" model since the city transferred from British to Chinese rule in 1997. It was the first time China's top Hong Kong policy office had given a briefing on the mass demonstrations."	CNN
116	https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/28/asia/hong-kong-protests-july-28-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 5:43 AM ET, Mon July 29, 2019	Beijing to speak out after weeks of Hong Kong protests	"Hong Kong (CNN)China's top Hong Kong policy office will on Monday address the escalating protests in the semi-autonomous city over the past eight weekends. The unrest reached fever pitch Sunday when riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters as the two groups fought pitched battles in residential areas. It was the second day of protests in a row amid the deepening political crisis that shows few signs of deescalating. Beijing's office dealing with Hong Kong and Macau affairs will give its first briefing on the issue from the Chinese capital at 3 p.m. local time Monday. On Sunday, protesters defied police orders to march through the center of the city, with groups splintering in different directions and blocking major roads. Many wore black, the adopted color of the protest movement, and carried signs condemning alleged police brutality. Riot police confronted hundreds of mainly young protesters who tried to reach the Chinese government's Liaison Office. During demonstrations last weekend, activists vandalized the building and flung paint at the national emblem, drawing a furious reaction from Beijing. The situation quickly deteriorated. Police fired multiple rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters, turning nearby streets into smoke-filled battlegrounds. Protesters, many of whom had armed themselves with improvised shields and bamboo sticks, fought back, hurling bricks, eggs and other objects at police lines. The two groups continued in a tit-for-tat struggle, with protesters at one point setting a cart on fire and pushing it in the direction of police. The violence brought much of central Hong Kong to a standstill, as tear gas permeated the air forcing shops to shut and trapping residents inside buildings. In the residential area of Sheung Wan, many people were left stranded after the subway suspended west-bound services and major thoroughfares were closed. Sunday marked the eighth consecutive weekend of mass demonstrations in Hong Kong. Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets since the protests began two months ago, plunging the city into its most serious political crisis since its return to China in 1997. Originally sparked by opposition to a controversial and now-shelved bill that would have allowed extradition from Hong Kong to China, the demonstrations have evolved to include calls for greater democracy, an independent investigation into alleged police brutality and the resignation of the city's leader, Carrie Lam. Demonstrators on Sunday initially met in Chater Garden in downtown Hong Kong, close to the Hong Kong government headquarters. Police had approved the rally but denied protesters' application to march through the city, citing the ""high"" risk of violent clashes -- the second time authorities have rejected a protest permit following a ban on yesterday's march in Yuen Long. Ventus Lau, 25, one of the organizers of Sunday's protest, called the police decision ""unreasonable,"" saying such logic would prevent ""peaceful protests"" in the future. ""This is a serious threat to our freedom of expression in Hong Kong,"" Lau added. More violence in Yuen Long Sunday's protest came a day after riot police and protesters clashed in the small town of Yuen Long, near Hong Kong's border with China. Yuen Long became an unlikely focal point of the city's pro-democracy movement after protesters returning to the town from a march in downtown Hong Kong last weekend were viciously attacked by a mob wielding iron bars and bamboo sticks. About a dozen men have been arrested in connection with that attack, some of whom have links to organized crime groups, or triads. Protesters were reportedly at the mercy of the mob for almost an hour before police arrived and at least 45 people were injured, some seriously. On Saturday, protesters -- many wearing black -- returned to the district, chanting ""There is no riot only a tyranny"" and ""Hong Kong Police, the lawbreakers"" as they thronged through the streets in sweltering summer temperatures. Police initially appeared unwilling to intervene, but as dusk approached, hundreds of officers in full riot gear advanced on demonstrators. The crowd quickly thinned, but a core of several hundred mostly young protesters in hard yellow helmets and protective gear, appeared unwilling to back down -- charging police lines and forming barricades. In response, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. A small group of front line protesters threw bricks and other materials at police as the two sides fought for several hours. As night fell, additional riot police advanced from multiple angles slowly pushing demonstrators in the direction of Yuen Long metro station, in a final bid to clear the streets. Chaos briefly reigned inside the station when riot police charged up the stairs with batons, hitting protesters and using pepper spray. Twenty-four people between the ages of 15 and 60 were hospitalized following the clashes, authorities confirmed. Two were in a serious condition. In statement Saturday, Hong Kong police reiterated that the demonstration had been an ""unauthorized assembly"" and accused protesters of throwing bricks and ""hard objects"" at officers during violent clashes. The protest in Yuen Long followed a large peaceful demonstration at the city's international airport Friday night. Thousands of protesters joined aviation staff in occupying the arrivals hall, where they greeted passengers with chants of ""Free Hong Kong"" and ""Justice for victims of brutality."" "	CNN
117	https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/21/asia/hong-kong-protest-july-21-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 1:52 PM ET, Mon July 22, 2019	Hong Kong protests: Night of violence shocks city after seventh week of mass marches	"Hong Kong (CNN)Hong Kong descended into scenes of chaos Sunday night, after riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters, and a mob armed with batons attacked people in a metro station. The unrest came after tens of thousands took to the street for the seventh consecutive weekend amid an ongoing political crisis over a now-suspended extradition bill. Footage posted on social media showed a marauding gang of masked men, wearing white T-shirts, attacking people wearing black, the color of the protest, on the platform and inside train carriages at Yuen Long MTR station, in the north of the city -- an about an hour from where the day's protest had taken place. Forty-five people were hospitalized following the violence in Yuen Long, with one person in critical condition, according to Hong Kong's Information Services Department. Five people remain in serious condition. The incident has raised fears that organized crime gangs, who are known to operate in the outer areas of the city, are becoming involved in the political crisis. In a statement Monday, police said they would not tolerate ""violent behavior"" and were actively following up the two incidents ""in order to bring the offenders to justice."" In a press conference Monday, Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam condemned the violence and said the government would investigate the incident in Yuen Long. ""Hong Kong is a very safe city. We will maintain the law and order in the city. We know that citizens have a lot of complaints to the society, but I will look for the roots of the problems,"" she said. ""Let me make this clear: violence is not a solution to any problem, violence will only breed more violence."" Protesters and their supporters have criticized police for what they say was a delayed response to the violence in Yuen Long. Democratic Party lawmaker and Yuen Long district councilor Zachery Wong Wai-yin told CNN that police drove away after he told them he was being threatened. He also accused officers of cooperating with local gangs, which are collectively known as Triads. ""We believe that police and Traids are linked to manage Hong Kong,"" he said. In an interview with local radio, Chief Superintendent John Tse Chun Chung of the police public relations branch, said police did not make any arrests because the two officers responding to the scene ""did not have protective gears"" and were waiting for reinforcements. Speaking to the press alongside Lam on Monday, Police Commissioner Stephen Lo denied accusations law enforcement officials were working with gangs hired to attack protesters. ""We will investigate whether we were inefficient but we are not related to triads. I ask you to trust the police force. Last night, we were all focusing on Hong Kong island. We needed to regroup for Yuen Long. I hope you have confidence in us,"" he said. Peaceful protest turns violent The violence in Yuen Long came as large numbers of protesters and police faced off in the city's Central and Sheung Wan districts. Sunday's demonstration had begun as a peaceful march, with organizers estimating that more than 400,000 people had joined the rally, while police said 138,000 took part. Protesters, many wearing black, chanted ""Free Hong Kong!"" as they thronged through the city. But, later in the afternoon, thousands defied police orders and marched beyond the designated end point towards the Chinese government's liaison office. Protesters spray-painted slogans on walls close to the building and defaced its emblem before retreating when faced with a growing police presence. Intermittent skirmishes continued amid chants of ""Liberate Hong Kong,"" as the crowd headed to the city center. There riot police fired tear gas to disperse a large group of mostly young activists, who had charged police lines with metal barricades. A CNN team witnessed police officers using rubber bullets against demonstrators and protesters throwing bricks at the police. In a statement, the Hong Kong government said it ""strongly condemns the protesters who blatantly challenged the national sovereignty by maliciously besieging and storming"" the liaison office building. Meanwhile, the Chinese Liaison Office condemned ""radical demonstrators' behaviors"" and said the unrest ""severely challenged ... the authority of the central government."" On Monday, Chinese state media ran editorials on the unrest, with the China Daily calling the protests a ""dirty game being played by the political radicals"" and Xinhua saying ""escalating violent attacks and provocative acts have completely exposed these mobs and the forces behind them, who want to paralyze the SAR government."" The Civil Human Rights Front, which organized Sunday's march, is demanding an independent investigation into what it says are unnecessarily brutal police tactics, as well as the release of those who were arrested during previous street clashes. An evolving movement The protests were initially sparked by strong public opposition to a proposed extradition bill. Critics fear that the bill, which has since been suspended, would allow citizens to be sent across the border into mainland China, to face trial in a system with a 99% conviction rate and a history of political prosecutions. On June 18, Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the bill was ""dead"" and there was ""no such plan"" to reanimate it. For protesters, however, that is not enough. They are calling for the complete and formal withdrawal of the bill, as well as for Lam's resignation and other democratic reforms in the city, which is ruled under a ""One Country, Two Systems"" arrangement with mainland China. Tammy Leung, who took part in a separate march of 4,000 social workers Sunday, calling for Lam to step down, said protesters were determined to keep marching. ""Why we keep coming out? Because the government do not handle or respond to anything on what is happening,"" said Leung. As protesters' demands remain unmet, demonstrations have grown increasingly violent. On Friday night police raided a suspected bomb-making factory in an industrial area of the city. Three men have been arrested in connection with the raid, in which 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of high-powered explosives, including triacetone triperoxide (TATP), and various weapons were uncovered. Leaflets linked to anti-extradition bill protests were also found on site. Pro-police marches Those who support the city's beleaguered police force and government are also making their voices heard. On Saturday, thousands of demonstrators gathered in support of the government and police at a scheduled rally in Tamar Park, in the city center, to ""safeguard Hong Kong"" from the so-called ""violence"" of anti-extradition protesters. The city's police force has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks. Many in the city have accused the police of using excessive force during protests, and criticized tactics that have included the use of rubber bullets and tear gas. Kay Chan, 39, a media worker said: ""Not every Hong Kong people is against the police force. Still a lot of us support them and a lot of us support our government. And also I support Chinese government. And so I, I want to show my support so I come to the event today."" One of the goals of Saturday's pro-Beijing march was to voice support for the force, organizers said. ""Who gives us the rule of law in Hong Kong? Who gives us its confidence? It's the Hong Kong police. They are doing a very good job,"" David Lan, of the Friends of Hong Kong Association, said Friday, after handing over a large donation to the police welfare fund."	CNN

On Monday -- the anniversary of Hong Kong's 1997 handover to Chinese rule -- hundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters marched in the city. Throughout the day however, thousands of protesters laid siege to the Legislative Council building, and late at night a few hundred, mainly in their teens and twenties and wearing protective gear, broke in and occupied it for several hours. Once through the large metal shutters guarding the entry to the building, frustrated and angry protesters destroyed anything in sight in the building's foyer and nearby area in a brief spasm of violence, though they left some rooms and objects untouched after the intervention of lawmakers. Legislative Council meetings have been postponed until October as a result of the extensive damage to the complex. Commission members inspected the vandalism on Thursday and found damage to the building's fire safety, security and communication systems as well as the security control room and meeting facilities, Legislative Council chairman Andrew Leung said in a statement. He also said personal information was stolen when protesters removed computer servers and hard drives. ""The Commission understands that it is difficult to find a suitable alternative meeting venue and we agree that priority should be given to the restoration of the Complex with a view to reconvening the Council meeting in October,"" Leung said. A number of ""temporary measures"" have been put in place and the hope is to lift the red alert ""as early as next week."" Certain public services in the complex will be suspended for a longer period of time, he added. Pictures from a press tour through the building Wednesday show the extent of the chaos: Anti-police graffiti scrawled on walls, papers strewn across floors, smashed egg shells, and destroyed paintings. One 31-year-old man, surnamed Poon, was arrested Wednesday in connection to the damage to the inside of the building on Monday night, Hong Kong Police said. Six people aged 20 to 72 were arrested on Sunday, when a pro-police rally was held, although police did not clarify whether those arrested were involved in the rally. Another 12 were arrested on Monday morning for a ""violent incident"" in the vicinity of the legislative council, following clashes with police. On Wednesday, police vowed to ""bring the culprits to justice for any unlawful acts."" The level of aggression seen on Monday -- which came after a month of largely peaceful protests against a proposed law which would allow extradition to China -- has been met with condemnation from some politicians and conservative voices. Lawmaker Priscilla Leung was among a number of lawyers who signed an open letter Wednesday, calling the destruction ""absolutely unacceptable"" and ""a disgrace."" ""We strongly condemn the thugs' behavior in clashing, damaging and insulting the Legislative Council,"" the letter read. ""We fully support the police to enforce the law and arrest these mobs and safeguarding the law and order of Hong Kong."" Xiang Zhang, vice-chancellor of Hong Kong University, also spoke out against Monday night's events. ""I am disheartened by the violence that occurred in the Legislative Council building and would like to condemn such destructive acts,"" he said in a statement. ""In the face of present difficulties, I firmly believe that people with different viewpoints can coexist in a state of civility, and that the rift in the society could be healed if all parties are able to reach out and engage in constructive dialogues."" But many others have spoken out in support of protesters, arguing that the government had failed to listen when protesters took more peaceful actions -- including marches in June that attracted hundreds of thousands of protesters. Civil Human Rights Front -- which has organized multiple large-scale peaceful demonstrations against the law -- said that the protesters had taken a step that ""none of us were brave enough to take."" ""Our views towards different courses of actions may differ, but we sincerely hope that no one blames one another nor breaks off with one another,"" the group said in a statement. ""Just like us, the protesters love this Hong Kong. In fact, they might love this city even more than we do."" Activist and singer Denise Ho tweeted on Wednesday that it was easy for people to ""condemn violence"" while looking at a few images from the outside. ""Dig deeper and you will understand the desperation in these kids, and the courage they have to be forging ahead of everyone, so they can find hope for everyone else."" Others have criticized the police for failing to protect the legislature, claiming that they allowed protesters to break into the building and sack it in order to use photos of the destruction against the movement, an accusation authorities have pushed back on. Although recent protests were sparked by the controversial extradition law, they have since become a touchstone for broader issues facing Hong Kong, including a lack of democracy and a perceived increasing encroachment of China on Hong Kong's way of life. When the former British colony was handed back in 1997, China agreed to that Hong Kong could maintain its freedoms and way of life for the next 50 years. Many Hong Kongers are concerned by the uncertainty of the future, on top of other social problems such as high property prices and cost of living."	CNN
119	https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/15/asia/hong-kong-protest-five-weeks-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 8:32 PM ET, Mon July 15, 2019	Hong Kong's summer of dissent: After five weeks of protest, where to next?	"(CNN)Hong Kong's summer of dissent is showing no sign of abating. For five consecutive weekends, the city of 7.4 million has been rocked by large-scale and occasionally violent protests, as demonstrators fight a proposed law that would allow individuals to be extradited to stand trial in mainland China. On Sunday, seven people were hospitalized after violent scuffles broke out between demonstrators and police in riot gear, after a largely peaceful protest against the bill in the residential area of Sha Tin. This was just the latest in string of clashes, as mass demonstrations become the new normal across the city. But what began as a protest movement against an unpopular bill has evolved to encompass a range of issues connected to mainland China's perceived encroachment on Hong Kong life. With protesters already talking about their next marches, there's a lingering question: Where will the demonstrations go from here? What are the protests about? The first major march of the summer, on June 9, saw hundreds of thousands of protesters -- or over 1 million, according to organizers -- take to the streets to protest the proposed extradition law. Protesters were concerned the bill could be used to seize government critics and send them across the border to face trial in a system with a 99% conviction rate and a history of political prosecutions. On June 16, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam moved to suspend the bill, but stopped short of a formal withdrawal. Protesters weren't satisfied. They've continued to call for the bill's complete withdrawal, saying that the government's decision to suspend it isn't enough. And as the protests against that law continue, the list of causes taken up by demonstrators has grown. On Saturday, for instance, protesters headed to Sheung Shui, a town on Hong Kong's border with mainland China, to protest against parallel trading, the process of bulk-buying consumer goods in Hong Kong to sell in mainland China. At other marches, protesters have called for universal suffrage in Hong Kong, a city that currently only has partial democracy. The weekend before, demonstrators gathered in suburban Tuen Mun to protest the local presence of middle-aged women from mainland China, who they said had been disrupting the peace by singing and dancing in the neighborhood park. ""Those are underlying community issues that have been there for some years,"" said Chinese University of Hong Kong politics professor Ma Ngok. ""It was fueled by the recent momentum and empowerment of the whole movement."" Distrust of the authorities has also become a central theme. Protesters want to see the police force made more accountable for its actions of recent weeks, which some see as unnecessarily brutal. Where have the protests been held? As the protest movement evolves, it is occupying a greater range of locations. In June, the marches were centered around traditional demonstration spots on Hong Kong Island where the city's financial district and government is based. The three major marches on June 9 and 12, and July 1 saw protesters marching from the bustling shopping district of Causeway Bay to the city's Legislative Council -- a well-trodden route for Hong Kong protests. But in July, protesters have switched things up. On July 7, protesters marched on the Kowloon side of Hong Kong -- an area popular with mainland tourists -- hoping to spread their anti-extradition bill message to mainland Chinese visitors. The following weekend, on July 14, thousands of protesters marched in residential Sha Tin -- the most populous district in Hong Kong -- which has not seen a protest on that scale since democracy protests in 1989, according to Ma. By taking the protests to more residential areas, organizers are hoping to make locals in those places feel they have no excuse not to join the movement, he said. Protesters are already planning a protest later this month in Tseung Kwan O, another residential area in Hong Kong's New Territories. How are the tactics of protesters and police changing? The major marches have attracted people of all ages -- from toddlers riding on their parents' shoulders to the elderly. The vast majority of these protesters are peaceful. But there's a small number of protesters who have been taking a different tack. After each of the major marches, young demonstrators wearing helmets and face masks have clashed with riot police. At times, the protesters have thrown eggs and other objects at symbols of authority. On June 12, three days after the first major march against the extradition bill, protesters and police faced off, with police firing pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets. Since then, police have put away the rubber-bullet guns, said Ma, but they have continued using pepper spray, including on July 13 and 14. They have also used a tactic of retreating from the protesters and then charging, something they did on both July 1 when protesters stormed the Legislative Council building, and in Sha Tin on Sunday. There also appears to have been an increase in some protesters' aggression levels. On Sunday, a Hong Kong government spokesperson said protesters had violently assaulted police officers. What next? Experts agree: Hong Kong's protests aren't stopping anytime soon. But John Burns, a professor of politics and public administration at the University of Hong Kong, said he didn't expect the level of violence to escalate further -- although he cautioned that if the minority who were using aggression against the police did escalate their actions, that could divide the protest movement. Another turning point could come in August, when Hong Kong school resumes, said Ma, as the young protesters will have less free time. ""It's impossible for us to conceive of one million people going onto the street each time,"" he said. ""(But) it is very easy to mobilize a few thousand people. ""I don't know how the government is going to wait out everything without changing the current leadership."" "	CNN

Sunday's protest was the first anti-extradition demonstration to take place in Kowloon, an area across the harbor from Hong Kong Island and away from the city's financial district. The choice of location was an attempt by the protesters to appeal to tourists from mainland China, who often go to Kowloon for shopping trips. Hong Kong Police put the turnout at 56,000, while organizers said 230,000 attended. The police said the protests were ""generally peaceful and orderly,"" but noted that six people were arrested. Five of those arrests were for assaulting a police officer, after protesters blocked roads Sunday night, while one person was arrested earlier in the day for failing to produce proof of identity. The crowds gathered around West Kowloon station, which connects Hong Kong with mainland China. Many of the slogans were chanted partly in Mandarin during the protest so Chinese mainland tourists could understand. Protesters fear the proposed new law could be used to seize government critics and send them across the border to face trial in a system with a 99% conviction rate and a history of political prosecutions. The ongoing protests have already forced the government to suspend the bill. Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam previously said there was no timeline for discussions around the bill to resume and indicated it's unlikely to pass this year. The protesters are demanding Lam retracts the bill entirely, and also called for her to resign. A law firm assistant, Penny Lau, was one of those attending the march on Sunday. The 24-year-old said the protests will go on until the government listens to their demands. ""I definitely do think the protests will continue as long as the government keeps ignoring us,"" she said. Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom, said Sunday that Lam did not receive any instructions or orders from Beijing to implement the controversial extradition law. ""Chief Executive and the Hong Kong government want to make Hong Kong a safer place, and not a safe haven for fugitive criminals,"" Liu said in a BBC interview. The ambassador said China was strongly opposed to what it called the ""British intervention in Hong Kong's internal affairs."" London summoned the Chinese ambassador over what it said were ""unacceptable and inaccurate"" comments made by Beijing regarding the UK's role in ongoing Hong Kong protests. Beijing has hit out at the UK over accusations of ""interference"" in the city after British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt expressed support for Hong Kong protesters and said London would stand by the city in preserving its limited democratic freedoms. The UK handed Hong Kong over to China in 1997. Under an agreement from that time, Beijing agreed the city would be governed under the principle of ""one country, two systems"" with a high degree of autonomy for the next 50 years. "	CNN

Beijing has hit out at the UK over accusations of ""interference"" in the semi-autonomous Chinese city, after British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt expressed support for Hong Kong protesters and said London would stand by the city in preserving its limited democratic freedoms. Hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers have taken to the streets in recent weeks over a proposed extradition bill with China critics fear would be used to go after political dissidents. On Monday, student protesters stormed and briefly occupied the city's legislature, causing widespread damage to the building and its contents before retreating in the face of a large police clearance operation. Referencing the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 which governs the handover of Hong Kong from British to Chinese rule, Hunt said on Tuesday that ""there will be serious consequences if that internationally binding legal agreement were not to be honored."" ""The UK signed an internationally binding legal agreement in 1984 that enshrines the 'one country, two systems rule,' enshrines the basic freedoms of the people of Hong Kong and we stand four square behind that agreement, four square behind the people of Hong Kong,"" added Hunt, who is campaigning to be the next British Prime Minister. His comments were greeted by outrage in Beijing, which has previously suggested the treaty -- which established a guarantor and observer status for the UK over its former colony -- is no longer applicable. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang on Wednesday accused Hunt of ""fantasizing in the faded glory of British colonialism and obsessed with the bad habit of criticizing and lecturing on other countries' affairs condescendingly."" China's ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, followed up with his own criticism, blasting London for its ""interference"" in Hong Kong and saying the UK-China relationship ""has been damaged"" because of it. ""I think it's totally wrong for Jeremy Hunt to talk about the freedom (of Hong Kong protesters) ... this is not a matter about freedom it's a matter about breaking laws in Hong Kong,"" Liu said. ""We all remember what Hong Kong was 22 years ago under British rule, there was no freedom (or) democracy."" The UK did not fully democratize Hong Kong during over a century and a half of colonial occupation, only introducing the limited form of democracy that the city enjoys today in the decade leading up to the 1997 handover. Chris Patten, the last colonial governor, did attempt to introduce greater democracy and political freedoms, against London and Beijing's wishes, but his reforms were rolled back when China assumed control of the city. Liu, who has since been summoned to meet with the UK Foreign Ministry, called on London to ""reflect"" and ""refrain from further damaging the relationship"" and ""refrain from interfering in Hong Kong internal affairs and Chinese internal affairs."" Responding to his comments on Twitter, Hunt said that ""good relations between countries are based on mutual respect and honoring the legally binding agreements between them."""	CNN

A spokesman for China's State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said in a statement Tuesday that they strongly supported the city's government and police force and severely condemned vandalism by protesters. ""This kind of severe illegal action damages Hong Kong's rule of law, social order and hurts Hong Kong's fundamental interests,"" the statement said. The comments come just hours after hundreds of mostly young, masked protesters stormed the city's legislature during demonstrations marking the anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule. Protesters destroyed portraits, computers and ceremonial displays, spray painting the walls with slogans such as ""Hong Kong is not China yet."" The partial ransacking of the governmental complex follows almost a month of increasingly heated protests against a now suspended extradition bill, which critics say could erode Hong Kong's freedoms. For weeks, hundreds of thousands of people have marched against the bill, leading to it being shelved though not formally withdrawn, while smaller -- but still substantial -- protests have clashed with police. On Tuesday afternoon, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang issued a stern warning to any country who ""interfered"" in Hong Kong. ""Don't interfere in Hong Kong's domestic affairs in any kind of way. Don't support those violent criminals in any form. Don't send any misleading signals. Don't make any wrong actions,"" he said. Geng accused countries expressing their support for the Hong Kong protesters as being ""extremely hypocritical."" ""If the violence which happened to the Legislative Council in Hong Kong happened in Europe or the United States, how would they deal with it?"" he asked. Coverage of the mass protests has been tightly controlled in Chinese state-media, with outlets choosing to either ignore or distort information relating to the demonstrations. This policy appeared to shift on Tuesday, however, with numerous outlets adopting a more openly critical tone. In an editorial titled, ""Say no to mob violence,"" state-owned tabloid the Global Times called for a ""zero tolerance"" approach to protesters. ""It is a disgrace that such a developed society could carry out this kind of reckless and savage violence that has signaled an ominous alert for the city's future,"" the editorial said. ""Chinese society is all too aware that a zero-tolerance policy is the only remedy for such destructive behavior witnessed. Otherwise, and without this policy, it would be similar to opening a Pandora's Box, upending social disorder."" The English-language state-owned China Daily, meanwhile, linked the unrest to Hong Kong's failure to integrate with broader Chinese policy. China's state-run Chinese television broadcaster, CCTV, showed footage of the vandalism inside the Legislative Council as part of a package on the anniversary of the Hong Kong handover to China from Britain, including footage of a pro-police rally the day before. Other outlets, meanwhile, either ignored the protests or tried to gloss over them with cheerful news from the anniversary of the handover in Hong Kong. State media Xinhua posted to its official Twitter a picture of 5,000 Hong Kong citizens spelling out ""I LOVE HK"" in massive letters. "	CNN

US Customs and Border Protection officials say they are investigating the posts, which were found in a closed Facebook group for current and former border patrol agents, according to the investigative reporting group ProPublica. CNN has not been able to independently access and review the Facebook group posts. The posts reportedly feature jokes about migrant deaths and derogatory comments about Latina lawmakers. Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers toured a border detention facility in Clint, Texas. They did not like what they saw. US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a tweet that people are drinking out of toilets. The head of operations for US Border Patrol denies this, saying there are ""ample supplies"" in the facilities. Ocasio-Cortez also called out the behavior of some border patrol agents, saying she saw some agents laughing in front of members of Congress and screamed at others for trying to take selfies with her before she toured a facility. ""I was not safe from the officers,"" the congresswoman told CNN. 2. Campaign 2020 3. Hong Kong protests Hong Kong's government headquarters is being treated as a huge crime scene today after hundreds of protesters stormed in and trashed it. The masked and mostly young demonstrators left graffiti-scrawled slogans, broken glass and debris throughout the building. Police are now in control of the headquarters. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, condemned the violence and vowed to pursue legal action. She also said the controversial extradition bill that protesters had been demonstrating against would not be brought back during the current legislative session. 4. Tariffs and the European Union The US may have restarted trade talks with China, but a potential new front is opening up in the trade wars. The US is threatening new tariffs on the European Union. The proposed $4 billion in new tariffs on EU goods would cover 89 products, including meat, cheese, pasta, fruits, coffee and whiskey. This would be added to a list of EU exports worth $21 billion that the United States Trade Representative said in April would be subject to tariffs. The proposed tariffs will be subject to arbitration from the World Trade Organization. So, why tariffs on EU goods? It's all part of a fight over aircraft subsidies, which the US and EU have been squabbling about for years. 5. Antarctica Sea ice in Antarctica has been slowly increasing for decades, but now it looks like that's over. Antarctic sea ice is now decreasing faster than sea ice in the Arctic, new research based on four decades' worth of satellite data reveals. Sea ice in Antarctica increased until about 2014, then took a big drop and hitting a record low in 2017. Scientists say it's just too early to determine what caused the change. Sea ice has a big impact on the Earth's climate because it reflects huge amounts of sunlight back into space. Less sea ice means more sunlight gets absorbed by the ocean, which in turn warms the planet. TODAY'S QUOTES ""Tyler has, and always will be, an important part of the Angels Family.""

Sudan protests People are protesting again in Sudan. People are dying, too. At least seven were killed as tens of thousands protested yesterday in Khartoum, the country's capital.

Many of those killed or injured in this weekend's protests were reportedly shot by the military. 4. Texas plane crash The crash of a private plane killed 10 people in Texas. The plane slammed into a hangar and then exploded just after it took off from an airport north of Dallas. There were no survivors.

The harm ranged from property damage to physical injury. About 21% of women and 23% of men reported experiencing alcohol-related harms, with the most prevalent type being harassment. The study had some limitations, mainly being that the data was self-reported, which lends itself to bias if a person in the study was not answering survey questions honestly.

The US retail giant said in a statement Thursday that it had decided to remove some of its goods ""based on feedback from Chinese consumers."" ""We have withdrawn from China a small number of products that were designed by a collaborator,"" a Nike (NKE) spokesperson told CNN Business. The company did not respond when asked to provide more details. The Financial Times reported Wednesday that Nike had pulled a line of sneakers made in partnership with Japanese streetwear label Undercover, which is led by designer Jun Takahashi. Chinese retailer YY.com said in a statement on its official social media account that it would not stock Undercover x Nike Daybreak shoes after ""an urgent notice issued by the Nike brand."" Undercover faced sharp criticism over recent comments about Hong Kong protests against a controversial bill that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China. Many demonstrators feared the proposed law could be used to deport activists or political targets from Hong Kong, which for decades has operated under the policy of ""one country, two systems."" Earlier this month, Undercover posted a snap of the protests to its Instagram Story, captioned ""No Extradition To China."" ""Go Hong Kong,"" it added in Chinese. Some social media users in mainland China expressed outrage over the post. On Weibo, China's version of Twitter, some vowed to throw out their Nike sneakers. One user posted a photo of shoes in a trash can. ""There is one China,"" another user wrote, adding that they were offended by the studio's comments. The same user uploaded a photo showing the ""Undercover"" logo on a Nike shoe crossed out. Undercover declined to comment. China is one of Nike's largest and fastest-growing markets. It's also a key manufacturing hub, with about a quarter of Nike's footwear and apparel being made there in the 2018 fiscal year. This isn't the first time foreign retailers have run into trouble in China. Last year, US retailer Gap withdrew a product from the market after customers complained that a map of China had left out Taiwan and other islands claimed by Beijing in the South China Sea. Japan's Muji was later fined by Shanghai authorities after it was discovered that the company had imported a batch of coat hangers wrapped in packaging that described Taiwan as a country. Nike was lauded last year for making Colin Kaepernick the star of a major marketing campaign. Kaepernick and other NFL players had protested police brutality before games.

Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Jun told a press briefing Monday that the G20 usually discusses global trade and economic issues and wouldn't focus on the week-long protests in Hong Kong. ""We will not allow Hong Kong issues to be discussed at the G20 summit,"" Zhang said. ""Hong Kong affairs are Chinese domestic affairs, any foreign force has no right to interfere in this."" The Foreign Ministry officially announced on Sunday that Chinese President Xi Jinping would be attending the G20 summit in Osaka between June 27 to 29, his first trip to Japan as leader. During his visit, Xi is expected to meet with United States President Donald Trump for talks aimed at restarting trade deal negotiations between the two countries. Zhang's comments that China would not discuss Hong Kong follow remarks by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on June 16 indicating that Trump may raise the mass demonstrations with Xi during their meeting. More protests are planned in Hong Kong on Wednesday, with campaigners calling for pro-democracy reforms. Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in Hong Kong over the past two weeks to protest against a government extradition bill which many fear could be used to deport political activists and dissidents to mainland China. Organizers said a huge protest on June 16 may have attracted up to two million people, or roughly a quarter of the city's population. Beijing's refusal to discuss Hong Kong at an international event is not unusual. The Chinese government regularly denounces attempts to bring up domestic issues at global forums. So far public statements from Beijing have been supportive of the Hong Kong government's attempts to pass the law while blaming foreign forces for the widespread public protests. ""We want to say this loudly: Pull back the black hand you have shown. Hong Kong is China's domestic affair. You shouldn't interfere in Hong Kong,"" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Wednesday. "	CNN

The problem is that the image was heavily edited -- cropped and mirrored -- to multiply the size of the crowd and make it look perfectly symmetrical. It's also been mislabeled, as the original photo was taken a week earlier at another anti-extradition rally. The image is the first result of a Twitter search for ""Hong Kong protests,"" with more than 28,000 likes and 8,000 retweets. It's also been reposted on Instagram by people including Nathan Law, founding chair of the pro-democracy group, Demosisto. The image's original author, as first reported by the Asian news site Coconuts, is Deacon Lui, who shared it June 11 on Instagram with the caption, ""whatever it takes. ... #noextraditiontochina (photo is cropped and reflected)."" Lui cropped the original picture, which he shared June 10 on Instagram, and reflected it using Photoshop, he confirmed to CNN. He took the original shot, which shows a sea of protesters on Hennessey Road, on June 9 from a building ""opposite Hysan mall and beside Sogo,"" he said. ""I was just trying to share the beauty of Hong Kong to everyone,"" Lui said, noting that the post's caption clearly states it's doctored. ""People should have acknowledged that as I stated."" Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Hong Kong on June 9 and a week later, despite a move by the city's embattled leader to suspend the extradition proposal. About 1.03 million people joined the June 9 march, organizers said. Organizers of the second march said around 2 million people took part, while police said it was 338,000 people. The bill, which would have allowed fugitives to be transferred to maintain China, has met with widespread opposition, including from Hong Kong's traditionally conservative business community."	CNN

Then check out this special interactive which highlights the South's most important civil rights sites. Here's what else you need to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Hong Kong protests It was calm today in Hong Kong after another massive protest in the city over the weekend over a controversial extradition bill with China. Organizers said about 2 million people took part in the march, which saw a sea of black-clad protesters fill the streets. (Police dispute that number, saying there were only 338,000 protesters.) The protesters want Hong Kong's lawmakers to pull the bill, which could make it easier for residents to be extradited to mainland China. They also want the city's chief executive, Carrie Lam, to resign. Today protest organizers called for strikes by both workers and students. 2. US and Iran Is the US prepping for war against Iran? No, says Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, but he did say the US is ""considering a full range of options,"" including military options, to deter and defend against Iranian aggression. Tensions are rising with Iran after two tankers -- one carrying oil and the other transporting chemicals -- were attacked near the Strait of Hormuz, a vital shipping route. The US and other nations blame the Iranians for the attacks. Meanwhile, Iran said it will make a ""significant"" announcement today about scaling back its commitments to the nuclear deal it made with the West. (President Trump has pulled the US out of the deal.) 3. South American power outage The power is back on this morning after a massive outage left tens of millions of people in the dark for hours yesterday in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. Was this the result of a cyber attack? Officials in Argentina don't think so, but an investigation into the ""unprecedented"" power outage, which also hit parts of Chile and southern Brazil, is just beginning. The blackout comes as concerns rise over governments' abilities to disrupt other nations' power systems. The New York Times reported that the US is escalating cyber attacks on Russia's electric power grid. 4. Campaign 2020 President Trump's re-election campaign hasn't even started (it officially kicks off tomorrow in Orlando, Florida) but already there's a shakeup. The campaign fired several pollsters after internal numbers showing Trump lagging behind Democratic candidates in key states were made public, sources told CNN. The President reportedly grew angry about the coverage of the numbers, which showed Trump trailing Joe Biden in states like Michigan and Wisconsin. The existence of the 17-state survey, which contained bad news for Trump in battleground states, was reported by CNN and others weeks ago. 5. Phoenix arrests Phoenix's mayor apologized over the weekend to a family that was arrested after a reported shoplifting incident at a store. Police drew guns on a couple and their two children after their 4-year-old daughter took a Barbie doll from the store. A 12-minute video of the incident last month shows a police officer kicking and yelling at a man as he's being handcuffed. Another officer appears to be pulling a gun on the passenger side of the couple's vehicle as a woman exits, holding a small child with a second child by her side. A police report says the incident escalated after the couple refused police commands. Mayor Kate Gallego said she was ""sick"" over what she saw in the video and called it ""completely inappropriate and clearly unprofessional."" She's calling for a community meeting tomorrow to talk about the incident. BREAKFAST BROWSE 'Ciao Maestro' On both the screen and the stage, Franco Zeffirelli was a giant.

130	https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/17/asia/china-hong-kong-us-protests-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 3:28 AM ET, Mon June 17, 2019	Trump may raise Hong Kong protests with Xi as city remains a thorn in Beijing's side	"Hong Kong (CNN)Hong Kong has once again burnished its reputation as a thorn in the side of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader, President Xi Jinping, after protesters swarmed the city's streets for the third time in one week. Years of relative calm after the 2014 Occupy protests had given the impression that the semi-autonomous Chinese city had fallen into step with Beijing under leader Carrie Lam. But in just eight days, mass protests have forced the government into a rare public backdown, emboldened anti-China elements in Taiwan and may even become a part of negotiations around the trade war between the United States and China. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with Fox News Sunday that he expected President Donald Trump to raise the Hong Kong protests with Xi at the G20 talks in Japan this month. ""I'm sure this will be among the issues that we discuss. We have a wide range of very important issues in the way China and the United States interact,"" he said. Publicly, the Chinese government has struck a defiant tone on the protests, supporting the local government and blaming ""foreign meddling"" and anti-China elements inside the city. But experts said the Hong Kong demonstrations drew attention to China at a time when Xi could least afford negative scrutiny. ""President Xi still wants to get the US trade talks back on track and he doesn't want to link trade with any other issue at this point,"" said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Xi's authority 'dented' A policy concession by a top Chinese official is rare to say the least, and for it to come as a result of public pressure is almost unheard of. Nonetheless, that's what Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam did on Sunday when she apologized to Hong Kong residents after an estimated 2 million of them, about a quarter of the city's population, took to the streets. A day earlier, the government had suspended the controversial bill that protesters said would have potentially put political activists and business people at risk of being extradited to mainland China -- and disappeared into the country's opaque criminal justice system. Chief Executive Lam and her government have insisted the bill was simply a way to close loopholes and ensure Hong Kong does not become a haven for fugitives from the mainland. Instead, debate around the law appears to have revived Hong Kong's nascent protest movement at the worst possible time for Beijing, amid the US trade war and just months before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. ""It implies that if people are brave enough to show defiance against Beijing, they can get away with it, they can get some results, they can force Beijing and the Chinese Communist Party to back down,"" said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and longtime analyst of Chinese politics. Lam said Xi's authority, already ""dented"" by the prolonged US trade war, would be further questioned in Beijing in the wake of the Hong Kong protests. ""This is one more set back for Xi Jinping,"" he said. Hong Kong divides US and China Hong Kong is an unwanted headache for the Chinese leader less than two weeks before he is due to meet world leaders at the G20 summit in Osaka. Most importantly, though it has yet to be confirmed, Xi is also expected to meet face-to-face with US President Trump for the first time since trade talks collapsed at the beginning of May. Both sides blamed the other for the failure and, in response, the Trump administration raised tariffs to 25% on an estimated $200 billion of Chinese goods. The Chinese government maintains it is not afraid of a trade war, but higher tariffs are an extra burden on an economy that's already showing signs of slowing. While both sides are trying to find a way forward, the Hong Kong protests have sparked another wave of antagonism and rhetoric between the US and China. After the initial protests, Secretary of State Pompeo expressed concern about the proposed extradition bill, while the US Congress has threatened new legislation which would downgrade Hong Kong's special status as a trading hub if Beijing doesn't stop infringing on the city's freedoms. That special status is significant. Hong Kong is allowed economic freedoms that are restricted to the rest of China, which, tied with an unbiased court system left over from the UK colonial period, have led to many large Western businesses basing their lucrative China operations out of the city. As more US businesses begin to look at investments outside of China, Hong Kong's role as the country's most economically liberal city is more important than ever. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Friday that any attempts to instigate chaos in Hong Kong were bound to fail. ""We urge certain people in the US to respect basic facts, discard arrogance and prejudice, stop playing dirty tricks that meddle in Hong Kong affairs,"" said spokesman Geng Shuang. China expert Glaser said it wasn't unusual for Beijing to accuse the US of interfering in its domestic politics, a standard pattern which went back decades to the fall of the Soviet Union. But she added it wasn't out of the question for President Trump to see Hong Kong as a potential point of leverage in trade talks, similar to his handling of Taiwan relations or the export ban on Huawei. ""There's always a risk that he chooses to use Hong Kong as a bargaining chip,"" she said. 'Over my dead body' The Hong Kong protests have also come during a heated presidential election campaign in Taiwan, which has increasingly been seen as a referendum on relations with mainland China. Taiwan and China have been separately governed since the end of a bloody civil war in 1949, and in the past decade Beijing has been attempting to woe the island back through a combination of promises and threats. President Tsai Ing-wen's Democratic Progressive Party has historically been seen as pro-independence, while the opposition Kuomintang have encouraged closer relations with the mainland. But in a sign that the Hong Kong protests are spreading, a leading opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate came out hard on Saturday against closer ties with the mainland. ""'One Country, Two Systems' can never be implemented in Taiwan. Taiwanese people can never accept it, unless it's over my dead body,"" presidential candidate Han Kuo-yu told a rally, referring to the special system of government used in Hong Kong. In response, the crowd chanted ""Reject 'One Country, Two Systems,""' according to Taiwan news agency CNA. President Tsai herself has made regular statements in support of the Hong Kong protesters, clearly trying to burnish her anti-Beijing credentials ahead of the January vote. ""In their pursuit of democracy and freedom, the people of Hong Kong (are) not alone. Because we know that if you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything,"" the Taiwan leader said on her official Twitter feed on June 13. China expert Lam said if the rebellious Hong Kong spirit spread to Taiwan, or even further, it would be dire news of Beijing. ""Xi has been trying to intimidate the people of Taiwan by naked demonstrations of force, but now the Taiwan people can point to Hong Kong to say that if the Taiwan people are united against China, they can get away with it,"" said Lam. ""They can even force Beijing to make a compromise."" "	CNN
131	https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/17/asia/joshua-wong-hong-kong-protests-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 2:54 AM ET, Mon June 17, 2019	Joshua Wong released from prison day after hundreds of thousands march in Hong Kong	"Hong Kong (CNN)A day after organizers said 2 million Hong Kongers took to the streets to march against an extradition bill with China, one of the city's pro-democracy icons has been released from prison. Joshua Wong walked free Monday after serving one month of a two month sentence related to protests in 2014. ""It's really good timing to join the fight for freedom and democracy,"" he told CNN after his release. ""Five years ago after the end of the Umbrella Movement, we claimed we would be back. Yesterday 2 million people came to the streets ... it shows Hong Kong people realize this is a long term battle."" Wong echoed protesters' calls for the city's Beijing-backed leader to resign. ""Why did Carrie Lam need to wait to suspend the bill until 1 million people came to the streets, it's because she's not elected by the people of Hong Kong,"" he said. ""It's time for her to step down."" Wong added that he thought Beijing too must be looking at the chaos in Hong Kong -- amid the US-China trade war and other headaches for President Xi Jinping -- and wondering about Lam's future. ""Hong Kong is just a small international city with seven million citizens, but two million people came to the streets, it shows that we have the consensus,"" he said. ""She has to end her political career."" Wong predicted that if the bill is not fully withdrawn and key officials resign, then protests could continue, particularly on July 1, the anniversary of the city's handover from British to Chinese rule and a key annual date for pro-democracy marches. One of Wong's first actions Monday was to pay his respects at a memorial in Admiralty, near the main site of the protests, where a man fell to his death Saturday after climbing a shopping mall and displaying signs calling for the withdrawal of the extradition bill. Wong's political party, Demosisto, has been among several youth groups -- all of which have their roots in the 2014 Umbrella Movement -- playing a big role in the protests against the extradition bill, which have been ongoing for weeks. In a statement Saturday after Lam said she was suspending passage of the controversial bill. Demosisto said Hong Kongers should ""demand that the bill be shelved for good, stand against political prosecution of protesters, condemn police brutality, and call for Lam's resignation."" ""That Lam continues to blame the bill's widespread opposition as a result of Hong Kongers' misunderstanding of it is also condescending,"" Demosisto said Saturday. ""Our movement may have won a battle, but the war is not yet over. We urge the international community not to turn away."" Wong appeared cognizant of that community in his statements Monday, speaking in Cantonese, English and Mandarin. He also thanked supporters in Taiwan, where the Hong Kong protests have become a major issue in the island's presidential election, creating yet another headache for Beijing. Born in 1996, eight months before control of Hong Kong was handed over from the UK to China, Wong has spent most of his adolescence and all of his early adulthood fighting for the city's rights against what he and others say is increasing encroachment by Beijing. A student leader during 2014's Occupy protests -- which called for universal suffrage in Hong Kong -- Wong became something of an international figurehead for the movement, and even appeared on the cover of Time magazine. His role in the protests later became the subject of the 2017 Netflix documentary, ""Teenager vs. Superpower."" "	CNN
132	https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/12/asia/hong-kong-protests-intl-hnk/index.html	Updated 10:29 AM ET, Thu June 13, 2019	Hong Kong protests: Two people in serious condition with legislature on lockdown	"Hong Kong (CNN)At least two people are in serious condition in Hong Kong hospitals after a long day and night of violence between police and protesters. An estimated 5,000 riot police fired tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and bean bags at tens of thousands of protesters as they forcibly cleared streets around the city's Legislative Council in Admiralty. Confrontations went late into Wednesday night as crowds of mostly young, college-aged protesters were pushed back from the Legislative Council complex towards the city's Central district. At least 81 people were injured in the violence, according to a Hong Kong Hospital Authority spokesperson. Two people were in serious condition, a spokesman for Hong Kong's information bureau said earlier. Fifty-seven males and 24 females aged 15 to 66 were treated, the hospital authority said. At a press conference Thursday evening, Hong Kong Police Commissioner Steven Lo Wai-chung said 11 people had been arrested over the course of Wednesday's protests on charges of disorderly conduct in a public place, unlawful assembly, and assaulting a police officer. He said 22 police sustained injuries during the protests, although it is not clear whether the 79 injured includes the number of police who were hurt. Lo said that protestors acted violently in an organized manner using bricks and sharpened metal poles to attack police. ""We had no choice but to escalate the use of force,"" Lo said. ""We strongly condemn the violent behavior of the rioters."" Speaking in English, his second language, Lo stressed that police were in control of the situation and would ""definitely not"" seek additional assistance from the Chinese People's liberation Army ""at the moment."" According to Lo, police fired 150 tear gas canisters, a ""few"" rubber bullets and around 20 bean bag rounds. Debate postponed In a series of statements Thursday, the Legislative Council said no meeting to discuss the extradition bill would be held on Thursday or Friday -- a partial victory for protesters and opposition lawmakers, who have been calling for it to be postponed or dropped altogether. ""Announcement will be made once the President determines the time of the meeting,"" a statement said. Central government offices next door to the legislature would also closed be Thursday and Friday, according to a statement. There was an extremely heavy police presence around the Legislative Council building and the city's Admiralty area Thursday. Dozens of protesters were also in the area, though their presence was very small compared to the previous day. Photos and videos on social media showed protesters cleaning up litter and debris leftover from Wednesday's clashes. Although Hong Kong is part of China, it has separate laws that follow a UK-style system and no capital punishment, unlike mainland China. Many people fear that the proposed extradition law means they could be taken from Hong Kong by Chinese authorities for political or inadvertent business offenses. Speaking Thursday, opposition lawmakers accused the police of overreaction and likened the violence to scenes more typically associated with mainland China. ""The protesters joined the rally with Hong Kong's best interests at heart,"" pro-democracy lawmaker Leung Yiu-chung said at a presser. ""The government has no heart at all."" Sudden violent turn Police and authorities were completely wrong-footed Wednesday morning as protesters ran into roads around the legislature and blocked them. Within an hour, the crowd was in full control of Harcourt and Lung Wo roads, two main traffic arteries in central Hong Kong. Scenes around midday were highly reminiscent of the Hong Kong's previous mass protest in 2014, known as the Umbrella Movement. Opposition lawmakers congratulated the young protesters for their success in blocking off the Legislative Council and preventing the day's scheduled debate from going forward. ""(This) boils down to a display of people power in Hong Kong, a display in particular of young people power,"" lawmaker Claudia Mo told the tens of thousands who had gathered outside the Legislative Council building. ""At the end of the Umbrella Movement, didn't we say, 'we will be back'? And now, we are back!"" Thousands of protesters sat around chatting happily, occasionally joining in with triumphant chants. As it reached midday, they were joined by many office workers from nearby buildings in Admiralty. That happy atmosphere took a dark turn as protesters continued to push their lines forward and met heavy police resistance around the central government offices on Tim Wa Avenue. After briefly seizing control of that road, protesters were forced back by repeated police tear gas barrages, pepper spray and baton charges. Police in heavy riot gear then cleared the street. From there, everything descended into chaos as a huge police deployment moved towards the main Harcourt Road protest camp from multiple directions, eventually forcing protesters onto roads leading towards Central and Wan Chai. As violent clashes erupted between protesters and the authorities late Wednesday afternoon local time, Hong Kong Police Commissioner Steven Lo Wai-chung said the demonstration was being considered a ""riot."" Under Hong Kong law, rioting is considered a serious offense, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Protest groups accused police of using excessive force, and videos posted on social media showed officers beating unarmed protesters and firing rubber bullets and tear gas canisters at point blank range. On Thursday, Lo confirmed that police had received 19 complaints relating to police behavior, including allegations of assault. He said police would investigate. 'Hong Kong people are furious' The extradition bill has been met with widespread opposition since it was first mooted, including from the city's traditionally conservative business community. Wednesday's protests came three days after a march in which organizers said more than a million people took part -- or roughly one in seven Hong Kong residents. Police gave a lower figure of 240,000 but the peaceful protest was by most independent measures the largest since the city's handover from British to Chinese control in 1997. Despite the mass demonstrations, the government, led by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has refused to withdraw the extradition bill, saying it is needed to plug loopholes to prevent the city from becoming a haven for mainland fugitives. On Monday, Lam said safeguards had been added to the bill to protect human rights and had received no instruction from Beijing to push it forward. Hong Kong's lawmakers had planned to dedicate 66 hours across five days to debating the bill. ""Hong Kong people are furious,"" senior Democratic Party lawmaker James To said Tuesday. ""Our chief executive just ignored the people's voice, despite the peaceful rally of a million Hong Kong people."" "	CNN

The attempted distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attack was aimed at flooding the app with so much traffic that it impaired normal service. It originated from ""IP addresses coming mostly from China,"" Telegram founder Pavel Durov said on Twitter. The impact was felt way beyond China. ""We're currently experiencing a powerful DDoS attack, Telegram users in the Americas and some users from other countries may experience connection issues,"" the company said in a tweet. The attack ""coincided in time with protests in Hong Kong,"" where people were coordinating on Telegram groups, Durov said. Hundreds of thousands of people have flooded the streets of Hong Kong this week, protesting against a controversial bill that would allow alleged criminals to be extradited to China. They fear the bill will leave anyone in Hong Kong vulnerable to extradition by Chinese authorities for political reasons or business offenses, undermining the city's legal system. The former British colony was returned to China in 1997, when Beijing agreed to guarantee its semi-autonomous legal system and certain democratic freedoms for the next 50 years under a policy known as ""one country, two systems."" Hong Kong lawmakers were due to debate the extradition bill on Wednesday, but that debate was postponed after the latest round of protests resulted in violent clashes. Many of the protesters have been using Telegram to coordinate their efforts. The messaging platform is designed to allow users to send messages protected by end-to-end encryption — the kind authorities can't intercept easily. CNN teams on the ground were told that the Telegram groups where people can get information about the Hong Kong protests range in number from hundreds of members to tens of thousands. Telegram, which says it has 200 million users worldwide, has been used in protests before, including anti-government demonstrations in Iran last year. The Berlin-based app uses two layers of encryption, allows users to remain anonymous, and claims to be faster and more secure than other messaging services. It has come under fire in the past for being the preferred app of terrorists. Russia banned it last year after the company refused to provide encryption keys to the FSB, a Russian security agency.

The state's governor just signed a bill to stop such silliness. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door.

Hong Kong protests Lawmakers in Hong Kong put off for now debate on a controversial bill that would let fugitives be extradited to China after protesters blocked roads and government buildings today. They pretty much brought central Hong Kong to a standstill. Police responded by firing rubber bullets and tear gas at the protesters. Critics of the bill say it will make anyone in Hong Kong susceptible to being grabbed and sent to mainland China for political reasons. They also say it undermines Hong Kong's semi-autonomous legal system. Chinese officials say the bill just plugs some loopholes in the country's extradition law.

It sure felt like it yesterday in Iowa, where President Trump and ex-Vice President Joe Biden (who is also the Democratic front-runner) held dueling events in the early voting state. It all turned into an insult fest, with Biden, who kicked off a three-stop swing, calling Trump an ""existential threat"" to the country, while Trump trotted out his old ""Sleepy Joe"" moniker. It's clear that the President is focused on Biden because the former veep represents the most formidable threat to Trump's re-election chances. Biden could peel away a number of the blue-collar voters who put Trump in the White House in 2016. 3. Energy America's renewable energy sector reached a big milestone earlier this spring. For the first time the sector -- which includes solar, water, wind and geothermal steam -- had slightly more energy generating capacity than coal. Renewable energy sources also generated more electricity than coal in April, although that achievement was partially driven by seasonal issues. The milestones reflect the declining costs of solar and wind as well as continued environmental concerns about coal. The US is also cutting back on its use of coal. Since peaking in 2008, the nation's coal consumption has plummeted 39% to the lowest level in 40 years. 4. Tropical Cyclone Vayu People in northwest India are getting out of the way as the strongest storm to threaten this part of India in decades barrels toward them. Almost 300,000 people are set to be evacuated ahead of Tropical Cyclone Vayu, which is expected to make landfall in Gujarat state tomorrow. The storm is expected to have winds of about 110 mph when it hits, which is equivalent to a borderline Category 2 to 3 hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. Gujarat state hadn't had a storm this strong hit since 1998, when a tropical cyclone with winds of 120 mph killed around 10,000 people. 5. Women's World Cup Did Team USA go too far when it crushed Thailand in the biggest blowout in World Cup history? The United States Women's National Team set a scoring record when it torched Thailand 13-0. Team USA, which is favored to win the whole tournament, scored after just 12 minutes and didn't let up the rest of the match. US players celebrated every goal, sparking criticism on social media. By the time it was all over, Thailand's players were in tears. The US team was accused of humiliating the Thai players, but Alex Morgan, a striker for the US, said it was important to score as many goals as possible in case goal difference later becomes a factor in the group stages.

Washington So, was the immigration agreement reached with Mexico to avoid tariffs on Mexican imports a big deal or a big nothingburger? President Trump said it's a huge deal because Mexico will now make a more robust effort to stem the flow of migrants toward the US. But critics accused the President of once again taking a victory lap for fixing a crisis he helped create. More fuel was thrown on the fire over the weekend when The New York Times reported that most of what was in Friday's deal were things Mexico had already agreed to do in previous immigration talks. 2. Hong Kong protests More than a million people jammed the streets of Hong Kong yesterday to protest a controversial extradition bill that would let Chinese authorities extradite fugitives from the city. This appeared to be the largest demonstration there since Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. Critics fear the bill will make anyone in Hong Kong vulnerable to being grabbed and sent to mainland China for political reasons. They also say it undermines Hong Kong's semi-autonomous legal system. Chinese officials say the bill would merely plug some loopholes in the country's extradition law. 3. Sudan The Sudanese capital of Khartoum, home to 2 million people, was virtually shut down yesterday amid a mass general strike. (Sunday was the first day of the country's Islamic working week.) Opposition groups had called for civil disobedience after 118 people died in last week's violent military crackdown on government protesters.

138	https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/29/world/hong-kong-occupy-central-hotel/index.html	Updated 9:16 PM ET, Thu January 29, 2015	Fully occupied? Hong Kong's protest hotel	"Hong Kong (CNN)The face of Hong Kong's chief executive covers the toilet paper and China's leader lingers next to you in the shower. Safe to say -- it's not your average hotel. Tucked away in an apartment building on a quiet side street of Hong Kong's busy Causeway Bay district, this small hotel is a shrine to the Umbrella Revolution. Freelance translator Stephen Thompson rented the apartment in early December, in the same week that police began clearing out the city's pro-democracy protest sites. Memorabilia ""I literally got the keys and then the next day I went down to Admiralty (the main protest site) and the police were coming and I just grabbed as much as I could,"" says Thompson. Posters, artwork and memorabilia from all three main protest sites now plaster every inch of the 600 square foot abode. Rows of construction helmets are mounted neatly on the wall, gas masks hang like ornaments around a door frame, newspaper clippings wallpaper the kitchen and a yellow umbrella serves a partial curtain, shielding the living room from the sun. ""I had the idea at first of an exhibition,"" Thompson says, ""and then when they (police) gave me the tents I thought, well, I'll put the tents in here too."" And the idea for Occupy Central Hotel was born. For as little as HK$78 ($10) per night, guests can pay via a listing on Airbnb to sleep in an original occupy tent. The two-bedroom apartment accommodates a total of eight, Thompson says, but five is the most he's rented at once. Each tent is adorned with a name relating to the movement, such as ""Freedom House"" and ""Foreign Force HQ."" Nicholas Watmough, 26, followed the Hong Kong protests from his hometown of Manchester, England, and recently extended his visit at the hotel. ""I had a look online. There are cheaper places to stay, but I thought this would just be more interesting. It's an experience worth having and it's a cause worth supporting,"" says Watmough. Worldwide guests Visitors from Ukraine, France, and Mexico round out some of the hotel's other recent occupants. Thompson says he has also hosted guests from mainland China, but only after they sent him messages saying they opposed Communist rule. Originally from London, Thompson describes himself as a ""white-skinned Chinese dissident."" A fluent Mandarin speaker and writer, he spent three decades in and out of China before the government threatened to revoke his visa for writing politically critical articles. He has been living in Hong Kong for eight years now -- and hoping to gain permanent residency soon. ""I feel Hong Kong is a kind of bubble of freedom and human rights in China,"" he says, which is why he found the 11-week-long, pro-democracy demonstrations so inspirational. Victor Gaume watched the Occupy movement with interest from afar. He says the Chinese university where he teaches French and history forbade him to come to Hong Kong to see the protests in person, which is why he is now staying at the hotel. ""It's always good to have people like Stephen who keep the memory,"" Gaume says. ""In China, students don't know what happened in (the Tiananmen Square incident in) 1989, because all the memories have been deleted."" Preserving the memory and keeping the democracy movement alive is something the 50-year-old Thompson says he is passionate about. However, the Hong Kong Home Affairs Department requires anyone running a guesthouse to apply for a special permit from the Office of the Licensing Authority -- something Thompson says he doesn't need to do, because he is selective about who he allows to stay. Despite questions over the legality of his venture, Thompson says he hopes to eventually open up two more Occupy-themed hotels - one for each of the main protest sites. Until then, pro-democracy supporters can continue reliving the protests in a tiny Causeway Bay apartment - having their own movement against Hong Kong's Chief Executive CY Leung, one flush at a time.

140	https://www.cnn.com/2014/12/24/world/asia/china-north-korea-hack/index.html	Updated 3:25 PM ET, Wed December 24, 2014	China censors news on Sony hack	"Censorship is a part of daily life in China. News articles are erased from online search engines, social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter are banned, and CNN is routinely blacked out for Chinese viewers. Instagram was a huge hit in China -- until the government banned it during the Hong Kong protests. ""All good things must end,"" one young Chinese woman told me -- seemingly resigned to the fact that she can no longer post photos on Instagram. While such restrictions would likely incite mass outrage in many Western countries, citizens in China often have no choice but to relinquish some personal freedom as the government keeps a firm grip on certain aspects of life in this booming society. China's Communist Party will do whatever it takes to stay in power. Censorship is just one tool -- along with quickly quelling civil disobedience. Of course, China feels like a utopia of liberty when compared with the repressive North Korean regime. I distinctly remember feeling a sense of freedom and relief when landing in Beijing after a recent visit to Pyongyang. In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the average citizen has never heard of the Internet or social media. Contact with the outside world is forbidden for all but the most elite members of this reclusive society. Propaganda rules the television airwaves and fills the pages of state-run newspapers. Censorship in China The Sony hack story has received limited news coverage in China. Stories have appeared on CCTV's newscasts and in newspapers like China Daily, though with far less prominence than some other international news outlets. In Shenyang on Tuesday, an Internet search for ""North Korea"" on China's leading (and government-controlled) search engine Baidu.com revealed a list of mostly positive articles about the DPRK. A Baidu search for ""North Korea hack"" in English revealed just one nearly two-week-old article naming the DPRK as ""one of several suspects"" in the Sony hacking investigation. An identical search on unrestricted Google on Wednesday found more than 36 million articles. When questioned by foreign reporters on Tuesday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying shied away from directly addressing the issue on the Sony hacking probe. ""We need sufficient evidence before drawing any conclusion,"" she said at a news conference, adding that the United States and North Korea should communicate. Of course, any substantive communication is unlikely given the two countries have no diplomatic ties. The Great Firewall of China Censorship is the reality of life behind the so-called Great Firewall of China. The Ministry of Public Security has been heavily censoring content for more than a decade. The Chinese government acknowledges that the Internet is a vital tool to support the country's rapid economic growth. Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba transactions totaled nearly $250 million last year, more than Amazon and eBay combined. Alibaba's overall revenue soared 54% to over $2.7 billion in 2014. China e-commerce transactions are expected to skyrocket to more than $700 billion by 2017. But with the Internet comes the risk of sharing information that, the Chinese government worries, could destabilize the country. In China, any threat to the Communist Party's tightly clenched grip must be controlled. It's why you're likely to find very little mention of North Korea's bureau 121 in this nation suspected of having its own shadowy People's Liberation Army unit 61398 -- believed to be responsible for cyberespionage. Incidentally, the Chinese military has also denounced the United States for having its own massive cyberspying program. As all of this continues to unfold, one thing is certain: International news organizations such as CNN will continue with extensive coverage. And, thanks to heavy-handed government censors, most citizens of China will continue get only the news deemed appropriate by the government."	CNN
