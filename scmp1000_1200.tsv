They are doing [a] very good one at the moment, [in] full swing,” Cheung said, referring to the day when a mob of white-clad men attacked people with sticks and iron rods in Yuen Long station. Police were accused of arriving late at the scene, prompting some to suggest they had acted in collusion with the attackers, a charge officers had denied. “[The IPCC] would come up with an initial report hopefully by the end of the year, or early next year,” he said. But the setting up of an independent COI remained the demand of many people, including some listeners who called in during the radio programme, which was a phone-in session tied to Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s policy address on Wednesday.

Recently, radical protesters have vandalised and set fires at railway stations, believing that the MTR Corp sided with police during clearance operations. On October 5 when the government enacted a ban on wearing facial coverings during demonstrations, the MTR Corp unprecedentedly suspended all train services for one day.
