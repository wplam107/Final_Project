When we talk about [an amnesty] and a pardon, it’s not targeting just one side,” Tang said, referring also to the arrests of some pro-government supporters who clashed with protesters, or even police officers being accused of using excessive force. He was among those who liaised with police and led more than 100 principals, teachers and social workers to PolyU, where they eventually persuaded 300 underage students to leave the cordoned site safely, after securing a deal with officers that minors would not be arrested immediately. It has been one month since police first surrounded PolyU on November 17, declaring the unrest a riot after protesters blocked roads and set fires nearby, which led to violent clashes between radicals and police.

The story buttressed a main claim of the protesters, that Beijing was intervening heavily in the city’s affairs. A state-run newspaper denounced the story as “fake” and “shameful.” The article was quickly made inaccessible to readers in mainland China. It was not the Chinese government that blocked the story. The article was removed by Refinitiv, the financial information provider that distributes Reuters news to investors around the world on Eikon, a trading and analytics platform. The article was one of a growing number of stories that Refinitiv – which until last year was owned by Reuters’ parent company, Thomson Reuters – has censored in mainland China under pressure from the central government. Since August, Refinitiv has blocked more than 200 stories about the Hong Kong protests plus numerous other Reuters articles that could cast Beijing in an unfavourable light. Internal Refinitiv documents showed that over the summer, the company installed an automated filtering system to help with the censorship. The system included the creation of a code to attach to some China stories, called “restricted news”. As a result, Refinitiv’s customers in China have been denied access to coverage of one of the biggest news events of the year, including two Reuters reports on downgrades of Hong Kong by credit-rating agencies.

Some foreign companies in Hong Kong may be losing patience and have started to make contingency plans in case the political unrest deteriorates again, an international business leader has warned. While they have so far downplayed the impact of the city’s bleak economic prospects, the foreign business community is aware of the city’s potential challenge to retain talent, according to Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. Wuttke said he was “struck” by the optimism of foreign companies that conditions in Hong Kong would remain stable, adding that there were concerns for the retail and restaurant sectors after the months of unrest but other sectors, such as cars and machinery, had not moved out of the city. But, he said, many of these businesses might relocate if the worst of the violent disturbances that had plagued Hong Kong for the past six months flared up again. The protests began in June over a now-withdrawn extradition law that would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to mainland China. The demonstrations escalated into wider and prolonged anti-government unrest marked by violent clashes between radicals and police which have eased off since the district council elections in November.

But acting chief judge of the High Court Jeremy Poon Shiu-chor, who penned the joint ruling with Court of Appeal vice-president Johnson Lam Man-hon, warned their decision “is not and should not be regarded as an encouragement or condonation for any person to cover their face” in situations previously covered by the ban.

In addition to punitive action against officials found to be responsible for undercutting freedoms guaranteed in the Basic Law – Hong Kong's mini-constitution — the law also requires the US Secretary of State to make an annual certification that the city enjoys sufficient autonomy from the mainland to warrant maintaining the special trade status it enjoys in Washington.

Hong Kong The move comes after US President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed into law the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which includes a reference to the sale of goods that have both military and commercial applications. Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act Under the legislation, Washington has the power to suspend Hong Kong’s special trading status if it is deemed to have lost a significant degree of autonomy from mainland China, as promised under the “one country, two systems” framework. As a result, the city will be subject to an annual assessment of the enforcement of export control laws that monitor and limit the sale of potentially sensitive products overseas.   The inclusion of dual-use technologies in the act comes at a time of growing concern in the US about Beijing’s rise as a global force in the tech sector that has also seen a crack down on technology transfers and greater scrutiny of academic partnerships between the US and China.

In a television interview broadcast on Sunday, Commissioner of Police Chris Tang Ping-keung also rejected mounting calls for an independent probe into his officers’ handling of anti-government protests, saying such an investigation would be “unjust” and would only incite further hatred against the force. He would only support the ongoing investigation by the force’s watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC). On the growing number of students being among the more than 5,800 people arrested so far for their involvement in the protests, Tang said he believed peer pressure and the public’s support for the use of violence were the major factors behind youngsters taking part in radical actions.

Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor Lam had held the consultation on September 26 to understand the concerns of residents and discuss ways to ease anti-government protests, sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, that have rocked the city for months. anti-government protests Some 76.2 per cent of those polled said the dialogue was “ineffective” or “very ineffective” in easing social tensions, while 63.8 per cent said the authorities had to meet the demand by demonstrators to form an independent commission of inquiry into the use of police force during the protests. ‘No more tear gas’: Protest march in Hong Kong ‘No more tear gas’: Protest march in Hong Kong ‘No more tear gas’: Protest march in Hong Kong Lam’s public dialogue saw 130 people selected at random to participate in the event, which had attracted applications from more than 20,000 Hong Kong residents. However, only 30 participants had a chance to air their views with the chief executive. About half of those who spoke in the three-hour session urged Lam to establish an independent inquiry into the use of police force.	SCMP

Beijing has “reserved powers” under the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution, to be involved in the process of selecting Hong Kong’s leader, whatever the method of election, Leung added during a talk at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club. The city could be led by a mayor, he said, but a mayor would then enjoy very limited powers, or the jurisdiction could exist under the current arrangement of a high degree of autonomy. But that power was derived from the additional mandate of the central government, he stressed. “If we want to have our cake and eat it, by changing to universal suffrage as the method of selecting the chief executive without Beijing’s approval, or electing and then installing the chief executive without giving Beijing the right [to reject], that for all intents and purposes is secession. “The ‘umbrella movement’ in 2014 wanted exactly that. Now, the last of the five demands of the black-clad movement is a repeat of the same,” he said. Cy Leung slams Chinese University chief for ‘U-turn’ on alleged police brutality

The encounter “has severely disrupted” the European country’s relations with China, Wu said. The remarks came as China stepped up its criticism of the US, Britain and other countries over their “meddling” in China’s internal affairs. Western countries and organisations including the European Council have called for restraint as some of the most intense clashes of the nearly six-month old protest movement in Hong Kong have occurred at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
