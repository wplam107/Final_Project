Several police officers were injured after they were attacked by rioters while they were on duty in Tsuen Wan. Hong Kong's Commissioner of Police Lo Wai-chung visited the injured officers in Princess Margaret Hospital on Sunday night.
Lo expressed strong anger and condemnation against the reckless, violent and unlawful acts and said the police force will strive to investigate all violent acts that have caused serious, even life-threatening injuries to the police officers.
Sunday's marches took place in Tsuen Wan and neighboring areas. After the marches ended, violent protesters deviated from their routes to attack police officers.
Some radical protesters hurled bricks and petrol bombs at police officers outside Yeung Uk Road Market in Tsuen Wan. They also aimed strong light beams at the officers and setting up barricades to confront the police.
Masked protesters, armed with poles and hats, escalated their violence in the afternoon and evening. They blocked various roads in Tsuen Wan, paralyzing traffic in the vicinity.
Having given repeated warnings to the protesters in vain, anti-riot officers fired tear gas and used minimum force to disperse them.
Some demonstrators also took down the national flag at the Kwai Chung Sports Ground, where the rally took place, and trampled on it, challenging the authority of the country and breaching the National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance, the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said in a statement.
The illegal and violent acts are appalling and they are pushing Hong Kong to a very dangerous edge. The government strongly condemns the violence, it said.
At the site, the police repeatedly unfurled signs for the demonstrators to leave, but demonstrators ignored the warning of the police. A police commander at the scene ordered to deploy at least two specialized crowd management vehicles, commonly known as the ""water cannon vehicles"", to disperse the crowd.
At around 7:30 p.m., many masked demonstrators who had been dispersed gathered again in Yi Pei Square of Tsuen Wan, holding iron bars, wooden sticks and bricks. They smashed doors and windows of several shops and broke some closed-circuit televisions.
About half an hour later, several anti-riot police officers arrived at the scene where shops were vandalized, and were immediately surrounded and assaulted brutally by a large group of masked radicals holding long metal rods.
With only small shields for defense, the police officers tumbled backward along the Sha Tsui Road, with the violent protesters chasing after them. In face of the extremely dangerous situation, a police officer fired a warning shot into the sky.
Superintendent Leung Kwok-wing of the New Territories South Regional Crime Headquarters said the police fired the shot as his life was in danger.

In a Nov. 15 speech at the Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy, the top U.S. diplomat once again blasted China over Hong Kong, saying that the Communist Party of China is ""inconsistent"" with what it has promised regarding the policy of ""one country, two systems.""
For the record, since Hong Kong's return to China 22 years ago, China's central government has been faithfully implementing the ""one country, two systems"" policy in strict accordance with the constitution and the Basic Law.
Since this June, Beijing has been consistent with its sturdy support to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government and local police force to end violence and restore order in the city.
Yet certain U.S. politicians like Pompeo have refused to acknowledge that fact.
As a matter of fact, the kind of ""one country, two systems"" they want the Chinese government to be consistent with is to deny Beijing's due constitutional rights and sovereign responsibilities over part of its own territory. In their mind, Hong Kong's autonomy and Beijing's legitimate jurisdiction are mutually exclusive.
That is deliberate distortion. The policy endows Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy, but that autonomy only happens within the framework of one country. Any attempt to erode that principle will not be allowed.
Also in his remarks, Pompeo talked about his government's intention to encourage the Hong Kong issue to be resolved in a ""nonviolent"" way.
If Washington is truly interested in ending violence in Hong Kong, it had better stop acting as the talisman of those Hong Kong separatists and rioters who have kept trashing the rule of law and disrupting social order with their violent acts.
Since June, violent protesters in Hong Kong have vandalized shops, attacked police officers, blocked roads, torched mass transit railway stations, turned universities into strongholds, forced classes to be suspended, and committed such horrendous crimes as stabbing and burning people who disagree with them.
Instead of encouraging those rioters to use nonviolent means, some U.S. politicians like Pompeo have chosen to add fuel to the fire. They met Joshua Wong Chi-fung and other like-minded separatists, have been pushing the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, and are going to greater and greater lengths in their rumor-mongering campaign on the Hong Kong issue.
Some sanctimonious U.S. lawmakers including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi even showed sympathy for the fanatic rioters and called their atrocities ""a beautiful sight to behold,"" while others defamed Hong Kong police and judicial bodies who have been strictly enforcing the law. Their practices of hypocrisy and double standard are too obvious to miss.
Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs and brook no interference from any foreign forces. And Beijing will continue to live up to its commitment to ""one country, two systems.""
For those Pompeos and Pelosis, their most constructive contribution to returning peace and stability to Hong Kong can only be ending China-smearing and getting their hands off China's domestic affairs.  BEIJING, Nov. 17 -- U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, it seems, has been fathoming new depths of disinformation and effrontery in badmouthing Beijing and its Hong Kong policy these days.

HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam told a press conference that the government has invoked the power under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance and make a new regulation in the name of prohibition on face covering regulation, to ""create a deterrent effect against masked, violent protesters and rioters.""
The ban, designed to end violence and restore order, will come into effect on Friday midnight, Lam said.
The move added Hong Kong to the list of countries and regions that have anti-mask legislations, including France, Canada and many states in the United States. In Canada, those breaking the anti-mask law during a riot or unlawful assembly face up to 10 years in prison.
Unrest has raged for more than three months in Hong Kong as radical protesters, often black-clad and masked, set fires on streets, vandalized public facilities including metro stations, and assaulted police, civilians and businesses.
Advocates for the ban said masks have been used by rioters to conceal identities and escape legal penalties in the drawn-out unrest, leading to a higher level of aggression on their part.

Since then, there have been ongoing violent protests and hundreds of arrests in Barcelona. Spanish Home Affairs Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska warned of heavy sentences of up to six years in prison for those arrested, saying the government was ""going to apply the penal code with all of its strength against the violent separatism which attacks the law."" In contrast to the support shown for the Hong Kong riots, western governments and media have for the most part kept silent on the ongoing Catalan situation. Gavin Newlands, a member of the Scottish parliament, said on his Twitter account that ""as of 0707 there was still nothing on the events in Catalonia last night on BBC News. But there is a piece on Hong Kong politicians shouting in Parliament."" M D Nalapat, an Indian scholar from Manipal University, commented in an article published in the Pakistan Observer that ""there are moments when silence is shameful, and this is what is happening in the wake of the Madrid Court showing a contempt for the very European values that Brussels prides itself on."" The way media organizations from western countries address the issues in Hong Kong and Catalonia shows the double standards that are applied in interfering in other countries' internal affair to suit their own interests. There seems to be a western media blackout on the Catalonia situation due to concerns that the violent acts will spread out to other places. Whereas in Hong Kong, they are thinking and doing the complete opposite. They put up the pretense of ""wishing the best for Hong Kong,"" but are actually secretly hoping for the riots to escalate and hinder China's development. However, history has proven that their double standards will not help maintain their interests, and will backfire on them. With the latest protests in other part of the world, it is apparent that violent acts by radical Hong Kong protesters are being copied by people in western countries. Apart from the separatist acts in Spain, radical environmentalists from western countries have also staged ""Extinction Rebellion"" protests in over 20 cities around the world, with some of their strategies and methods reportedly coming from Hong Kong protesters. As much as the rule of law is respected and valued in western countries, no country that governs with law will allow situations similar to that of Hong Kong to happen. Those countries which help fan the violence in Hong Kong are hurting themselves and will be crushed by their own weight."	CCTV

The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, drawing condemnation from Beijing. The act, if it passes the Senate and then becomes law, will not only harm relations between China and the United States and severely damage Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, but also cause boomerang effects to the United States itself.
The act requires Washington to review Hong Kong's autonomy annually to justify the special trading status the city receives under United States law. This is de facto interference in China's domestic affairs, and is contrary to the basic principles and promises Washington made when it established diplomatic relations with Beijing.
What Hong Kong needs most right now is an end to the riots and violence, the restoration of public order, and maintenance of the rule of law. Intervention by the United States in the affairs of Hong Kong will only inflame the rioter's aggression and aggravate the already challenging public security situation. This would further damage Hong Kong's development at a time when some institutions are already predicting that Hong Kong's economy will flatline or contract this year.
As one of the major trading partners of the United States in Asia, disorder in Hong Kong offers no benefits to America's economy. Over the past decade, the United States enjoyed a surplus of some 297 billion U.S. dollars from its trade with Hong Kong – the surplus was nearly 34 billion U.S. dollars last year alone. Scrapping Hong Kong's special trading status will only make Washington's trade deficit worse. Hong Kong is also a major destination for investment by the United States: In 2017, its direct investments in the city surpassed 81 billion U.S. dollars. And a loss of stability in Hong Kong will undermine the interests of the 85,000 American nationals living in the city and the 1,300-plus American companies operating there.
Washington needs to put an end to the efforts to bring the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act into law. The support it would provide to rioters in the city harms the interests of the people of Hong Kong as well as the interests of the United States. And, as a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, Beijing would definitely take forceful countermeasures in response.

The act requires the United States government to assess the level of freedom in Hong Kong in order to decide whether Washington will continue to grant the city special trading privileges under the 1992 United States-Hong Kong Policy Act. This legislation shows that Washington is intent on persisting in the role of self-appointed global policeman.
Over the 22 years since Hong Kong's return to China, the city has maintained its status as a free port and a separate customs territory with the support of the central government. It has built on its relationships with other countries under the name of ""Hong Kong, China"", and been an active participant in international economic, communications, tourism, cultural, and sporting organizations. It's clear to anyone looking at the situation through fair eyes that the city enjoys a high degree of autonomy.
The string of violent incidents that have rocked Hong Kong over the past four months has put a serious strain on the city's social cohesion and economic health. Rioters have disregarded the rule of law, not to mention the ordinary constraints of civil society, and directly challenged the ""one country, two systems"" principle that has been successfully implemented since 1997.
Some U.S. lawmakers have decided to turn a blind eye to the damage the rioters are doing to the city, and have chosen instead to praise their violence. These same lawmakers have been quick to criticize the Hong Kong police, claiming that they're oppressing the city's residents as they struggle in extraordinary circumstances to restore law and order.
Hong Kong is a major trading partner of the United States.

Tang Ping-keung, deputy commissioner of police, said at a press briefing on Monday that during the series of protests, radical protesters acted lawlessly and escalated the level of violence. They have spread the violent acts across Hong Kong, causing serious inconvenience towards the general public's daily life and posing threats to people's safety.
The 149 people, arrested between Aug. 9 and Aug. 12, comprise 111 male and 38 female, aged between 15 to 53. They were suspected of crimes including unlawful assembly, assault on policemen, obstruction of police in the execution of duty, possession of offensive weapons and dangerous objects.
Tang said that on Aug. 11, some people turned a deaf ear to the police's objection and got involved in unauthorized rallies. Some of the protesters later went to different places all over Hong Kong and blocked main roads and thoroughfares, besieged police stations and damaged police vehicles.
In Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon Peninsula, a mob threw petrol bombs into the police station, and the legs of a policeman were burnt by fire consequently.
The police noticed that some protesters were involved in extremely violent activities, and therefore they carried out intelligence-led operations and arrested 15 core members of the mobs on Aug. 11 in Causeway Bay, the Hong Kong Island.
Tang called on protesters to stop using violence to disturb Hong Kong's social order and he hoped that the Hong Kong society can soon restore calm.

The statement was made in response to an open letter from a group of overseas politicians and persons to the HKSAR chief executive. The HKSAR government firmly refutes unfounded and misguided claims in the letter.
In the statement, a spokesperson of the HKSAR government said that over the past six months violence had escalated and reached an alarming level.
Masked rioters vandalized public facilities and shops, committed arson, hurled petrol bombs as well as wantonly attacked police officers and people with different views, the spokesperson said.
An innocent man was set on fire in broad daylight by protesters while a government contract cleaner was killed by a brick thrown at him. So far, 520 police officers have been injured on duty. Meanwhile, no protesters were killed as a result of direct police action.
The extent of students and minors being involved in such violent protests is particularly worrying, the spokesperson added.
On New Year's Eve, rioters hurled petrol bombs in various districts, causing damage to a police vehicle and three private cars, according to Hong Kong police.
Despite the rampant violence, police exercised restraint in law enforcement, the spokesperson said, noting that police did not initiate actions against protesters and only responded with appropriate and proportionate force when protesters took part in illegal activities.
The actions and response of police over the Christmas period, and at all times over the past six months, were only in response to the blatant disregard for public safety and order by radical protesters, the spokesperson said, adding that police acted with restraint and the minimum force necessary to restore law and order.
The spokesperson further stated that the HKSAR government is determined to safeguard the core values of Hong Kong at all times as they are ""the cornerstone of our long-term prosperity and stability.""
Noting that the extensive media coverage -- local, international and in the digital world -- about the protests and events, the spokesperson said it is ""unprecedented in Hong Kong's history.""
""That in itself is evidence enough that the freedom of the press is well protected, and citizens of Hong Kong continue to enjoy the freedom of participating in lawful and peaceful demonstrations to express their views,"" the spokesperson said.

""The police and the CUHK have reached a consensus in search for a peaceful solution. However, the situation in CUHK continues to intensify,"" Hong Kong police said in the statement. The standoff began Tuesday at the CUHK campus. Hundreds of protesters threw bricks, petrol bombs, launched arrows and even fired a signal flare at police officers during the standoff. Such violence has reached a deadly level, posing a serious threat to police officers and everyone at the scene, police said in the statement. The radical protesters threw hard objects and petrol bombs onto Tolo Highway, endangering drivers' safety. They also hampered emergency services, such as ambulance services. A specialized crowd management vehicle is on standby at the scene and will be deployed to assist a retreat if necessary, police added.  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Chief Executive Carrie Lam earlier on Tuesday said protesters were being ""extremely selfish"" and urged teachers and students not to engage in political activities at schools. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang on Tuesday reiterated the Central Government's support for HKSAR in exercising its power under the Basic Law and added that the police action was in accordance with the law as it was made to ""protect personal and other residents' safety."" Hong Kong police: University campus or 'weapons factory'? On Wednesday, Hong Kong police briefed the media on a standoff. In it, the police expressed strong suspicions that the campus was used by rioters as a ""weapons factory"" from which several hundreds of petrol bombs were thrown in a single day. Last night, some violent protesters on the CUHK campus armed with chainsaws, petrol bombs, bows and arrows attacked the police and the lives of the police were seriously threatened, Senior Superintendent Wong Wai-shun of Operations Wing said at the press conference. One of the four police officers injured last night was shot in the neck by protesters' signal flare.  ""What happened in the Chinese University of Hong Kong is a black moment for Hong Kong. An university is supposed to be a breeding ground for future leaders, but it became a battlefield for criminals and rioters,"" the police said. In addition, police said they arrested 142 people Tuesday (97 men and 45 women) on charges that included illegal assembly, assaulting police and possession of offensive weapons. ""If someone breaks the law, regardless where you hide, the police have lawful powers to come after the offenders and bring them to justice,"" police added. "	CCTV

It was reported that an unnamed senior U.S. official said Monday the U.S. condemned ""unjustified use of deadly force"" in Hong Kong violence, claiming the police and civilians alike ""have a responsibility to de-escalate and avoid violent confrontations.""

PARIS, Oct. 22 -- Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi here on Monday slammed the violence and foreign interference in Hong Kong.
In an interview with AFP during his visit to France, Wang reiterated that issues related to Hong Kong are China's internal affairs, and that according to the Charter of the United Nations, no country has the right to determine the internal affairs of any other nation.
Wang said one basic fact about Hong Kong is that what is going on in the Chinese city nowadays is in no way peaceful protests, but pure and simple street violence. Some rioters, wearing similar clothes and face masks and holding iron rods and Molotov cocktails, have unscrupulously committed crimes, he added.
Wang accused the mobs of smashing shops, damaging public facilities, beating up innocent citizens, paralyzing airports and even openly attacking police, threatening their lives. These are crimes and cannot be tolerated in any country or any society, Wang said.
Hong Kong has always been advocating the rule of law, any action should be conducted within the framework of the law, and any discontent should not be an excuse for violence, Wang said.
He noted that the most significant thing for Hong Kong now is to stop violence, curb disorder, restore order and administer the city by law.
Wang said another basic fact about Hong Kong is that some foreign forces, including some media outlets, turning a blind eye to what is really happening and even calling white black, have called the street violence a pro-democracy move and branded the police deployment in accordance with law as violence.
Wang said some foreign forces have encouraged and indulged the street crimes so as to upset Hong Kong, and ruin its prosperity built by generations of hard work and its great historic progress achieved since the implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" policy.
These attempts will never and can never succeed, Wang added.
People in Hong Kong will certainly recognize these agendas of the foreign forces, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government will certainly restore the rule of law, and China's central government will certainly stick to the ""one country, two systems"" principle according to the constitution and the Basic Law, Wang said.
Wang expressed the hope that people with conscience around the globe will view the situation in Hong Kong objectively and impartially.
The violence in Hong Kong is being imitated elsewhere, for example in Spain's Catalonia, Britain's London, and the streets of Chile, he noted, saying some demonstrators have announced that they would turn their cities into another Hong Kong and imitate the street violence there.
Some even called the violence in Hong Kong ""a beautiful landscape,"" and such remarks made by those people have lost the minimum conscience, Wang said.

The U.S. House of Representatives passed the act, proposed by some congressmen, on Tuesday local time despite strong opposition from the Chinese government.

The disturbance, originated from proposed ordinance amendments, has become ever more violent. It is inescapably related to the overt or covert support from the U.S. side to anti-China troublemakers in Hong Kong, Yang said.
He noted that some violent radicals have been wantonly beating, smashing, looting, causing serious obstruction to the traffic, and vandalizing public facilities.

Denouncing the passing of the bill as a severe interference in China's internal affairs and a serious violation of international law, Hua said Beijing will suspend the review of the request for U.S. maritime vessels visiting Hong Kong and sanction several U.S. non-governmental organizations (NGO), effective Monday. The list includes the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), National Democratic Institute (NDI) for International Affairs, International Republican Institute, Human Rights Watch, and Freedom House. ""This is the price they are paying for destroying Hong Kong's peace and stability,"" she stressed, referring to facts and evidence that showed U.S. NGOs' backing anti-Beijing activists in Hong Kong, funding 'pro-independence' protests and inciting acts of extreme violence and crimes. The NED, one of the U.S. NGOs to be sanctioned, though defines itself as a private, non-profit organization committed to supporting democratic institutions worldwide, has been proved covert ties with Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which operates two of its largest overseas branches in Hong Kong, one of which - NDI - is also on the sanction list. China will take further, necessary countermeasures, as the situation develops, to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests, Hua said, urging the U.S. side to get back to the right track and keep its dirty hands off Hong Kong, which is Beijing's internal affairs. Radical protests have been wreaking havoc in Hong Kong since June, at times forcing businesses, government institutions, schools and even the international airport to shut down. The city was partly paralyzed and violence flared as anti-government protesters rampantly smashed facilities, set fire, assaulted innocent civilians, trampled on the rule of law, and jeopardized social order. Beijing has repeatedly condemned foreign interference in its internal affairs, as U.S. officials were seen meeting with several radical opposition figures, including the ""Hong Kong independence"" activist Joshua Wong.  Also, in June, U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi publicly stated that Hong Kong demonstrations were ""a beautiful landscape,"" and part of congressmen raked up the so-called ""Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act"". Then in July, Pence and U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton held meetings with Hong Kong opposition leaders. Beyond that, more American faces appeared in Hong Kong violent demonstration scenes from media exposed pictures, let alone the figure of the American flag."	CCTV

""Human rights and democracy are making steady progress in Hong Kong, but the U.S. is trying to contain and even damage Hong Kong's stability through the act, which is hypocritical. I am completely confident about Hong Kong and I believe that the people in Hong Kong want their life to get back to normal,"" he added.
Chan Hak-kan, member of Hong Kong Legislative Council, Vice Chairman of Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, said the Hong Kong-related act is an interference in Hong Kong's affairs and China's internal affairs, which is very shameful.
He believes since Hong Kong returned to motherland, it has become more democratic and has taken a giant step forward compared with those years under the colonial rule.
He stressed, ""The people of Hong Kong can now govern Hong Kong. In the international community, Hong Kong's human rights situation and democracy index are both higher than those of the U.S.""
Lai Ka-chi, member of Hong Kong Youth Enlightenment also condemned U.S. interference.
""Actually, the U.S. has a lot of problems concerning its own human rights. The act reflects the double standards of the U.S. No matter what means it uses or what kind of laws it passes, its attempt to deter our country's development is doomed to fail,"" he said.
Professor Lau Siu-kai from the Chinese University of Hong Kong noted the U.S. is opening challenging China's sovereignty by passing the so-called ""Hong Kong act.""
Through encouraging or supporting protesters in Hong Kong, American politicians want to make Hong Kong a pawn to contain China, he said, warning this could be a major threat to China's national security.
For the professor, the U.S. aim is to slow down China's development by triggering unrest in Hong Kong, and China has to take a tougher response.
The brutal interference of the U.S. government on the internal affairs of China shows that Washington is destroying Hong Kong's stability, said Lam Lung-on, president of Hong Kong Chinese Importers' and Exporters' Association.
According to Lam, the act on Hong Kong that Washington just signed into law is actually breaking Hong Kong's advantage as a global trade center, world financial center, and world shipping center.
The so-called ""Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act"" will also hurt American companies doing business in Hong Kong, he said, noting that the law will hurt people from both sides.

China's ambassador to Britain has said that the top priority in Hong Kong is to ""end violence and restore order,"" denouncing what he called the ""inhuman, murderous violence"" that ""must not be tolerated.""

Journalists take notes as Liu speaks (Credit: CGTN)
Rioters in Hong Kong occupied roads and buildings at the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong over the weekend. On Sunday, they shot arrows and hurled petrol bombs from the campus at police, and set fire to the flyover connecting the campus and the Hung Hom MTR station. One police officer was shot in the leg with an arrow.
""The recent escalation of illegal, violent activities pushed Hong Kong into an extremely dangerous situation,"" said Ambassador Liu Xiaoming, addressing media at the Chinese Embassy in London. 
Quoting comments made by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the recent BRICS Summit in Brazil, Liu said ""the incessant extreme violent offences in Hong Kong trampled on the rule of law, disrupted public order, severely undermined the prosperity and stability in Hong Kong, and gravely challenged the bottom line of 'One Country, Two Systems'.""
Expanding upon Xi's speech and discussing those at the university, Liu said that ""while claiming they stand with the weak, the rioters have indiscriminately hurt ordinary citizens… such inhuman, murderous violence in broad daylight trampled on the bottom lines of law, morality and civilization and must not be tolerated.""


Repercussions in Europe and worldwide
Liu described how events in Hong Kong have had repercussions in Europe: ""Some besieged the Secretary for Justice of Hong Kong SAR, who was invited to an event in London,"" he said.
""She was pushed to the ground and sustained an arm injury. We express the strongest indignation and condemnation over these violent acts.""
Turning to the global perception of events, Liu warned that Hong Kong's reputation was being tarnished. ""In media reports, Hong Kong is now associated with incessant violence and disorder."" 
""The success and achievements of the past 22 years since the handover are being eroded. The once oriental pearl is turning into an oriental scar. Hong Kong the fragrant harbour is sliding into an abyss of chaos. The future of Hong Kong, if such a situation continues, would be unimaginably dreadful.""
Liu also criticized ""external interference"" from other governments and media outlets. ""External forces that have indulged and fanned violence in Hong Kong cannot absolve themselves of the responsibility for the recent escalation of violence,"" he said. ""They confuse right and wrong, and refer to the extreme violent offenders as 'peaceful demonstrators' and 'pro-democracy protesters.' 
""At the same time, they are piling blame on Hong Kong police who are performing their duty, safeguarding the rule of law and protecting the safety of life and property of Hong Kong citizens.""
The ambassador finished by appealing to the British people. ""There are 300,000 British citizens and more than 700 British companies in Hong Kong,"" he said. ""Continued chaos in Hong Kong will bring nothing but harm to the UK.
""I sincerely hope that British people who have the larger picture in mind will have a clear understanding of the current situation. I hope they will support the SAR Government in ending violence, restoring order and upholding the rule of law.""
Meanwhile the UK government said it was concerned by the violence on ""all sides.""
A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We remain seriously concerned by the situation in Hong Kong and the escalation of violence between protesters and police. We continue to urge for calm and restraint on all sides and support the right to peaceful protest.""

Young flag guards perform their duty at a flag-raising ceremony at the Wong Cho Bau School in China's HKSAR, Sept. 2, 2019. (Xinhua/Qin Qing)
HONG KONG, Sept. 2 (Xinhua) -- School principal Wong Kam-Leung spread a message of peace, hard work and loving one's own country as he made his first-day-of-school speech.
On Monday, 800 students and teachers gathered for a national flag-raising ceremony at a spacious hall of Wong Cho Bau School in the New Territories. Flag-raising at the beginning of a school year is its tradition.
""It saddens me to see all the controversy and disturbances in Hong Kong over the summer. Those young people who threw a national flag into the sea must have very low respect for the flag and the country. Today's ceremony is significant. It teaches students to respect the country,"" he told a roomful of attendees.
""We can only have a safe home and a nice place to study when we have a strong nation at our back. For Hong Kong to develop, it must integrate into the overall picture of the Chinese nation, and that is the way for young people in Hong Kong to find success in the future,"" he said.
As students return to school, a handful of violent demonstrators disrupted the morning public commuting by blocking train doors.
To avoid possible disturbances by riots, teachers arrived at the school early on Monday morning, said Sharon Yau, one of the 60 teachers at the school.
""I can't help worrying about not being able to get to work, a traffic jam or a station shut down due to the protests. Demands should be expressed in a sensible manner, instead of disrupting people's lives and causing fear,"" she said.
A team of 19 young flag guards in white uniforms marched in the ceremony, while their classmates watched respectfully. All stood at attention as the flag was hoisted.
""I'm nervous but very excited. We practiced a lot to make sure we march at the same pace. This is a huge honor for me,"" said 9-year-old April Lam, who joined the flag guard team five months ago.
Hong Kong has more than 1,000 kindergartens, 587 elementary schools, 506 secondary schools, and 22 institutions that confer higher education degrees. Classes began on Monday without disturbances, despite boycott calls from the opposition. Kindergartens canceled classes due to torrential downpours.
On Monday, yellow school buses were visible on the streets. Most schools in Hong Kong were generally normal on the first school day, and the traffic was smooth, said Kevin Yeung Yun-hung, secretary for education of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government.
""In the past few weeks, we have been liaisoning and discussing with different stakeholders in the sector to ensure normal school operation as far as possible. Of course, we need to monitor the situation closely, and we are prepared to provide support to schools if necessary,"" Yeung said.
""I think it's a common value in the society and also among the education sector that schools should not be used as places to make political demands or to put pressure on the government for political needs,"" Yeung added.
RESTORING ORDER AT SCHOOLS
Long before the new academic year kicked off on Monday, concerns had been mounting about possible campus bullying, especially those targeting children of police officers.
The personal data of at least 1,662 police officers and their families have been illegally disclosed online since June, including pictures of the children of the police and information about their schools and classes.
In some cases, teachers reportedly encouraged bullying against children of the police. In response, Yeung issued a stern warning that the schools concerned must ""take disciplinary action"" and the education bureau will impose punishment accordingly, including considering whether they are still qualified to be an educator.
In the face of cyberbullying and threats of attacks against children of the police, personal alarm devices were offered to police with children under the age of 18, according to media reports.
According to the police, 117 liaison officers keep in contact with primary and secondary schools to offer assistance if necessary.
The unrest since early June has already had a negative impact on some middle school students, sending an alarm to teachers, parents, and civil groups. Two petrol bombs were found among the belongings of a 13-year-old suspect detained recently.
In an open letter to all elementary and middle schools in Hong Kong, a civil group named Safeguard Hong Kong warned of possible class boycotts and campus bullying and called for efforts to bring the ""nature of education"" back to schools.
CALLS TO END CHAOS
The prolonged protests and violence have drawn ire among the public. On Monday, a handful of violent demonstrators disrupted morning commuting by blocking train doors. Hong Kong opposition also bewitched students to boycott classes to keep tensions high.
Denouncing the new wave of disruptive and even dangerous behaviors, many people are appealing for peace and rational thinking.
Before the new semester began, Margaret Chan, former director-general of the World Health Organization, called on students not to skip classes amid the current chaos and refrain from violent protests.
""School years are the most beautiful and precious time in one's life,"" Chan, who is also a mother, said in a statement to students. ""Cherish your time, get yourselves prepared for a beautiful future.""
The current situation also left Yu Kwok-chun, vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, in distress, particularly when he saw teenagers and students being instigated into violent acts.
""I hope students can calm down and return to campus for the new semester,"" Yu said.
Yu's concerns were echoed by Lam Suk-yee, former president of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions.
""The unrest has brought mayhem to Hong Kong's economy and public security, and greatly damaged infrastructure facilities,"" Lam said. ""Such acts are harming others and not benefiting society. Our residents have had enough.""
She hoped all students and workers, white- or blue-collar, can stick to their posts amid efforts to stop violence, end the chaos, restore order and rebuild a prosperous and stable Hong Kong.

(Xinhua/Qin Qing) HONG KONG, Sept. 2 (Xinhua) -- School principal Wong Kam-Leung spread a message of peace, hard work and loving one's own country as he made his first-day-of-school speech. On Monday, 800 students and teachers gathered for a national flag-raising ceremony at a spacious hall of Wong Cho Bau School in the New Territories. Flag-raising at the beginning of a school year is its tradition. ""It saddens me to see all the controversy and disturbances in Hong Kong over the summer. Those young people who threw a national flag into the sea must have very low respect for the flag and the country. Today's ceremony is significant. It teaches students to respect the country,"" he told a roomful of attendees. ""We can only have a safe home and a nice place to study when we have a strong nation at our back. For Hong Kong to develop, it must integrate into the overall picture of the Chinese nation, and that is the way for young people in Hong Kong to find success in the future,"" he said. As students return to school, a handful of violent demonstrators disrupted the morning public commuting by blocking train doors. To avoid possible disturbances by riots, teachers arrived at the school early on Monday morning, said Sharon Yau, one of the 60 teachers at the school. ""I can't help worrying about not being able to get to work, a traffic jam or a station shut down due to the protests. Demands should be expressed in a sensible manner, instead of disrupting people's lives and causing fear,"" she said. A team of 19 young flag guards in white uniforms marched in the ceremony, while their classmates watched respectfully. All stood at attention as the flag was hoisted. ""I'm nervous but very excited. We practiced a lot to make sure we march at the same pace. This is a huge honor for me,"" said 9-year-old April Lam, who joined the flag guard team five months ago. Hong Kong has more than 1,000 kindergartens, 587 elementary schools, 506 secondary schools, and 22 institutions that confer higher education degrees. Classes began on Monday without disturbances, despite boycott calls from the opposition. Kindergartens canceled classes due to torrential downpours. On Monday, yellow school buses were visible on the streets. Most schools in Hong Kong were generally normal on the first school day, and the traffic was smooth, said Kevin Yeung Yun-hung, secretary for education of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government. ""In the past few weeks, we have been liaisoning and discussing with different stakeholders in the sector to ensure normal school operation as far as possible. Of course, we need to monitor the situation closely, and we are prepared to provide support to schools if necessary,"" Yeung said. ""I think it's a common value in the society and also among the education sector that schools should not be used as places to make political demands or to put pressure on the government for political needs,"" Yeung added. RESTORING ORDER AT SCHOOLS Long before the new academic year kicked off on Monday, concerns had been mounting about possible campus bullying, especially those targeting children of police officers. The personal data of at least 1,662 police officers and their families have been illegally disclosed online since June, including pictures of the children of the police and information about their schools and classes. In some cases, teachers reportedly encouraged bullying against children of the police. In response, Yeung issued a stern warning that the schools concerned must ""take disciplinary action"" and the education bureau will impose punishment accordingly, including considering whether they are still qualified to be an educator. In the face of cyberbullying and threats of attacks against children of the police, personal alarm devices were offered to police with children under the age of 18, according to media reports. According to the police, 117 liaison officers keep in contact with primary and secondary schools to offer assistance if necessary. The unrest since early June has already had a negative impact on some middle school students, sending an alarm to teachers, parents, and civil groups. Two petrol bombs were found among the belongings of a 13-year-old suspect detained recently. In an open letter to all elementary and middle schools in Hong Kong, a civil group named Safeguard Hong Kong warned of possible class boycotts and campus bullying and called for efforts to bring the ""nature of education"" back to schools. CALLS TO END CHAOS The prolonged protests and violence have drawn ire among the public. On Monday, a handful of violent demonstrators disrupted morning commuting by blocking train doors. Hong Kong opposition also bewitched students to boycott classes to keep tensions high. Denouncing the new wave of disruptive and even dangerous behaviors, many people are appealing for peace and rational thinking. Before the new semester began, Margaret Chan, former director-general of the World Health Organization, called on students not to skip classes amid the current chaos and refrain from violent protests. ""School years are the most beautiful and precious time in one's life,"" Chan, who is also a mother, said in a statement to students. ""Cherish your time, get yourselves prepared for a beautiful future."" The current situation also left Yu Kwok-chun, vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, in distress, particularly when he saw teenagers and students being instigated into violent acts. ""I hope students can calm down and return to campus for the new semester,"" Yu said. Yu's concerns were echoed by Lam Suk-yee, former president of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions. ""The unrest has brought mayhem to Hong Kong's economy and public security, and greatly damaged infrastructure facilities,"" Lam said. ""Such acts are harming others and not benefiting society. Our residents have had enough."" She hoped all students and workers, white- or blue-collar, can stick to their posts amid efforts to stop violence, end the chaos, restore order and rebuild a prosperous and stable Hong Kong."	CCTV

China on Wednesday voiced its resolute opposition to the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act that some U.S. lawmakers threatened Congress will pass, saying that by doing so, those lawmakers are interfering in China’s domestic affairs and attempting to incite riots in Hong Kong.
In fact, those who lend their support to the radical rioters in Hong Kong also include high-ranking American officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and agents such as the CIA. Not only have they met with Hong Kong separatists in person, provided support in the form of funding, threatened to associate the Hong Kong issue with trade talks with China, but they have also made indiscreet remarks stating that they hope Hong Kong’s democracy and freedom can be respected. Such criticism overflows with prejudice and arrogance.
Since June this year, radical rioters in Hong Kong have attacked the police, beaten a journalist and even tourists, attacked the Hong Kong Legislative Council building and the Central Government Liaison Office, insulted the country’s national flag, national emblem and Hong Kong’s regional emblem, blocked public transportation services, and paralyzed the airport. Such acts have seriously trampled on the rule of law and order in Hong Kong and seriously damaged the nation’s national dignity.
The former Editor-in-Chief of German economic magazine Wirtschaftswoche Stefan Baron points out in his latest commentary that, “The US is wrongly interfering in the protests in Hong Kong”, and if such riots had taken place in the United States the rioters would have faced a crackdown long ago. The article also stated that “With almost imperial arrogance, the US government is involved in the protests. Their behavior also violates the Vienna Convention.”
In the Index of Economic Freedom reports issued by the American think-tank the Heritage Foundation, Hong Kong has been rated as the world’s freest economy every year since its return to China in 1997. This is the most objective assessment of the result of the successful implementation of the “one country, two systems” policy, the “Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong” principle, and a high degree of autonomy.
Washington may want to lend an ear to Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong who said recently that the United States, as the world’s pre-eminent power today, “has to accommodate an increasingly powerful and influential China.”“The US needs to accept that China’s rise is inevitable, and that it is neither possible nor wise to prevent it.”
Restraint is not weakness, for it arises out of genuine strength. American politicians and anti-China forces should not underestimate China’s determination to defend its national sovereignty, security and unity as well as its unwavering will to safeguard Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity. Those who attempt to instigate chaos in Hong Kong with the aim of containing China's overall development will have to face the consequences of their own deeds.

In lynch mob-style assaults, they repeatedly kicked and punched the man, tied his wrists together and pulled his identity documents from his wallet.

BEIJING, Aug. 5 -- The bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle brooks no challenge.
Black-clad, masked protestors removed the Chinese national flag from a flagpole in Tsim Sha Tsui of Hong Kong and later flung the flag into the water Saturday, an unforgivable, lawless act that has blatantly offended the national dignity, is an insult to all Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots, and must be severely punished in accordance with law.
Escalating violence by radicals instigated by behind-the-scenes masterminds since mid-June has severely undermined the law-based governance and social order of Hong Kong, negatively impacted the local economy and people's livelihoods, and damaged the region's image.
From storming the Legislative Council Complex and blocking roads, to attacking police officers with bricks, sharpened iron rods and even petrol bombs, from surrounding Hong Kong police headquarters and disrupting the normal work of local government departments, to besieging the building of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and defacing the national emblem, as well as Saturday's flag-insulting, all these evil acts have exposed the attempts of some radicals and the forces behind them to paralyze the HKSAR government, undermine the ""one country, two systems"" principle, seize control of the HKSAR and use the chaos in Hong Kong to contain the overall development of China.
Since the return of Hong Kong, the central government has repeatedly stressed that it will ensure the principle of ""one country, two systems"" remains unchanged, is unwaveringly upheld, and is fully applied without any distortion or alteration.
It has also stressed that any attempt to endanger China's sovereignty and security, challenge the authority of the central government and the sanctity of the Basic Law of the HKSAR, or use Hong Kong as a channel for infiltration and sabotage against the mainland is an act that crosses the bottom line, and is absolutely impermissible.
Hong Kong compatriots should have a sober understanding of the harm and nature of the violence by this tiny number of radicals, resolutely uphold the ""one country, two systems"" principle, and safeguard the rule of law and social order.
We can be confident that Hong Kong will overcome all these challenges and difficulties and further advance the ""one country, two systems"" practice.

The U.K. Minister of State for the Middle East described the violent scenes in Hong Kong as ""unacceptable"" and called on the HKSAR government to conduct thorough and independent investigation. The U.S. Department of State asked the HKSAR government to respect freedom of speech and assembly.
 
When asked to comment on those remarks, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a press briefing that the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR and the HKSAR government all made clear responses to the recent violent incidents in Hong Kong.
 
In response to U.S. official's comments, Hua pointed out that what happened in Hong Kong recently ""had nothing to do with the freedom of speech and assembly.""
 
It is radical and violent behaviors that violate law, which directly undermines the foundation of rule of law in Hong Kong, goes against the Basic Law and Hong Kong's local laws, and seriously challenges the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, she said.
 
According to Hua, ""the central government supports the HKSAR government in its effective administration according to law, as well as the police in punishing the perpetrators of such illegal violence to safeguard social stability in Hong Kong.""
 
Hua said that there are clear signs of foreign manipulation, plotting and even organization in the relevant violent incidents judging from what was reported by the media. ""Could the U.S. side answer this question honestly and clearly that what role did the U.S. play in the recent incidents in Hong Kong and what is the purpose behind it,"" Hua asked.
 
She called on the U.S. to at least know one thing, that is Hong Kong belongs to China, and the Chinese government absolutely does not allow any foreign forces to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs, nor will it allow any foreign forces to disrupt Hong Kong.
 
Regarding the comments from the British official, Hua said that since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the policy of ""one country, two systems"" has been smoothly implemented.
 
""Residents in Hong Kong now enjoy unprecedented rights and freedom,"" said the spokesperson, adding that the U.K. had been talking a lot about the rights and freedom in Hong Kong. However, without security and stability, where do rights and freedom come from?
 
Hua mentioned that people from all walks of life in Hong Kong recently held peaceful assemblies themed ""Safeguard Hong Kong"" to condemn the violent behaviors of the opposition that tear the society apart, which showed that the majority of Hong Kong residents have a sober understanding of the damage and nature of the violent illegal behaviors of a small number of radicals, and want to make concerted efforts to safeguard Hong Kong.

Chief Executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam said Tuesday that more relief measures will be rolled out soon to help businesses and residents weather out economic hardship, following three rounds of such policies adopted during the past months. (Xinhua/Lui Siu Wai)
As multiple data have revealed a grim economic circumstance, the HKSAR government will closely monitor the situation and carry out new relief measures, Lam told a press conference.
The HKSAR government has allocated about 20 billion Hong Kong dollars (2.55 billion U.S. dollars) in total since August in hopes of reviving an economy that has stepped into a technical recession.
GLOOMY ECONOMY
""We lost millions of Hong Kong dollars each month recently,"" a server of a spicy crab restaurant in Causeway Bay said. At lunchtime, there were only a few diners at the restaurant that just opened in July.
Wong Ka-wo, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said Hong Kong's catering sector is expected to lose 17 billion Hong Kong dollars (2.17 billion U.S. dollars) from June and December, and about 400 restaurants have closed down so far.
""The official unemployment rate in Hong Kong's catering industry in October is 6.1 percent, but my estimate is 7 to 7.5 percent, that is nearly 22,000 people lost their jobs in October,"" he said. He was afraid that over 1,000 more restaurants may not survive the current crisis by February.
""Business sentiment has turned pessimistic, weighed down by external uncertainties and local violent incidents that have dragged on for months,"" HKSAR government Financial Secretary Paul Chan said at a meeting of the Legislative Council, stressing that industries from tourism to catering are struggling in the bleak winter.
Retail sales decreased 24.3 percent from a year ago in October, the largest decline for a single month on record. Visitors to Hong Kong tumbled 43.7 percent year on year in October.
The economy dropped 2.9 percent in the third quarter, sharply down from the 0.4-percent growth in the second quarter.
PESSIMISTIC SENTIMENT
""Three months? Half a year? I have no idea when my life can be normal again,"" a tour guide surnamed Wan said. The veteran tour guide who had gone through hard days of the financial crisis and the SARS outbreak felt that he could not make it this time.
With no tour groups to receive since June, Wan has started to take part-time jobs at metro stations and restaurants.
Tourism was one of the hardest-hit sectors by the months-long violence. ""There is no sign of a recovery in December, instead a 30-to-40 percent drop in the tourism revenue will be likely,"" a lawmaker and tourism industry insider Yiu Si-wing said.
""Even if the situation settles down a little bit, the sector is unlikely to return to the previous level.""
The HKSAR government has cut its gross domestic product forecast for 2019 to a negative 1.3 percent, which will be the region's first annual decline since 2009. The unemployment rate, which has already spiked to 3.1 percent during the August-October period, will likely rise further in the coming months.
Hong Kong will likely register its first budget deficit in 15 years for the current fiscal year ending on March 31, as the economy has slipped into a technical recession amid the prolonged social unrest, Paul Chan said.
Despite possible fiscal deficits in the coming one or two years, it is high time the HKSAR government made full use of the wealth and surplus accumulated in the past to relieve the burden on residents, Carrie Lam said.
VIOLENCE MUST END
Lam said she hopes violent incidents will stop as soon as possible to give the economy a chance to recover.
Analysts pointed out that relief measures can only help businesses keep afloat for a longer time and it is the end of violence and the restoring of peace that will allow people to return to their normal lives and push the economy back on track.
Chan also expressed concerns about looming challenges to the economy in the next year and even bigger impacts on people's livelihood, as well as the dented confidence of international investors.
""We need concerted efforts from all sectors of the community to stop violence and chaos and facilitate the economic recovery,"" Chan said. ""So that order can be restored, residents can live a peaceful life again and businesses can operate normally.""

The economy dropped 2.9 percent in the third quarter, sharply down from the 0.4-percent growth in the second quarter. PESSIMISTIC SENTIMENT ""Three months? Half a year? I have no idea when my life can be normal again,"" a tour guide surnamed Wan said. The veteran tour guide who had gone through hard days of the financial crisis and the SARS outbreak felt that he could not make it this time. With no tour groups to receive since June, Wan has started to take part-time jobs at metro stations and restaurants. Tourism was one of the hardest-hit sectors by the months-long violence. ""There is no sign of a recovery in December, instead a 30-to-40 percent drop in the tourism revenue will be likely,"" a lawmaker and tourism industry insider Yiu Si-wing said. ""Even if the situation settles down a little bit, the sector is unlikely to return to the previous level."" The HKSAR government has cut its gross domestic product forecast for 2019 to a negative 1.3 percent, which will be the region's first annual decline since 2009. The unemployment rate, which has already spiked to 3.1 percent during the August-October period, will likely rise further in the coming months. Hong Kong will likely register its first budget deficit in 15 years for the current fiscal year ending on March 31, as the economy has slipped into a technical recession amid the prolonged social unrest, Paul Chan said. Despite possible fiscal deficits in the coming one or two years, it is high time the HKSAR government made full use of the wealth and surplus accumulated in the past to relieve the burden on residents, Carrie Lam said. VIOLENCE MUST END Lam said she hopes violent incidents will stop as soon as possible to give the economy a chance to recover. Analysts pointed out that relief measures can only help businesses keep afloat for a longer time and it is the end of violence and the restoring of peace that will allow people to return to their normal lives and push the economy back on track. Chan also expressed concerns about looming challenges to the economy in the next year and even bigger impacts on people's livelihood, as well as the dented confidence of international investors. ""We need concerted efforts from all sectors of the community to stop violence and chaos and facilitate the economic recovery,"" Chan said. ""So that order can be restored, residents can live a peaceful life again and businesses can operate normally."" Multiple districts in Kowloon descended again into chaos over the weekend as rioters hijacked public events and resorted to destructive acts like building barricades on roads, setting fires and vandalizing public facilities. "	CCTV

During the past more than five months, rioters conspired with foreign forces and escalated violent acts, which resulted in political antagonism, social splits, and setbacks in the economy.
The election also fell victim. Campaigns of some patriotic candidates were seriously disrupted, and their offices were trashed and set ablaze. One candidate was injured in an attack. Harassment on patriotic candidates occurred on the voting day.

The most urgent task at present is still to bring the violence and chaos to an end and restore order.
To guarantee a violence-free election, the HKSAR government, the police, and patriotic people made tremendous efforts. The smooth election on Sunday has shown the common desire of Hong Kong residents for peace and order.
However, the foundation for current stability is still not firm enough. To prevent Hong Kong from slipping further and push it back on track, various sectors of the community should join hands to end violence and chaos, to restore the rule of law and rationality.
Chinese President Xi Jinping pointed out the direction and guidance for Hong Kong to stop violence and restore order at the 11th BRICS summit in Brasilia, capital of Brazil. All patriotic forces in Hong Kong should be encouraged and gather more strength.
Joint efforts should be taken to firmly support the HKSAR chief executive in leading the HKSAR government to govern in accordance with the law, support the Hong Kong police in strictly enforcing the law, and support the Hong Kong judicial bodies in severely punishing the violent criminals in accordance with the law.
Despite the impacts of violence, Hong Kong still boasts unique advantages. It remains as one of the freest economies and a global financial hub, and is striving for becoming an international scientific and research center.
There are also enormous opportunities from the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Hong Kong will be able to give full play to its advantages and achieve joint development with the country.
It should be noted that Hong Kong people, especially youngsters, should have a broader vision, a longer-term goal, and a real sense of national identity to let those advantages be brought into full play.
The Hong Kong community should also correctly understand the relationship between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, and let the two sides become an eternal community of emotions and destiny on the basis of constitutional order.

To linger at the edge of the cliff or kick-start a revival? The decision lies in the hands of every Hong Kong resident and depends on whether or not the right course can be taken under the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
After the unprecedented chaos, Hong Kong people should regain their Lion Rock Spirit and face challenges with courage and wisdom.

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government on Thursday expressed strong opposition to the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act and the other act on Hong Kong in the U.S. House of Representatives after the bills were approved by the U.S. Senate.
Passage of the legislation has sent a wrong signal to violent protesters and would not help calm down the current situation in Hong Kong, the HKSAR government said in a statement.
Those unnecessary and unwarranted acts will harm the relations between the two sides and their common interests, the HKSAR government said, reiterating that foreign legislatures should not interfere in any form in the internal affairs of the HKSAR.
The passage of legislation also triggered concerns about the economic prospects of Hong Kong among economic experts in Hong Kong, who pointed out that restrictive trade measures that may be adopted could easily backfire.
""The bill is not in line with the interests of the United States,"" said Francis T. Lui, professor emeritus of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
Citing figures that the United States has earned 297 billion U.S. dollars from trading with Hong Kong in the past decade, the largest bilateral trade surplus amongst its global trading partners, Lui said the U.S. move is not helpful in achieving its goal of balanced trade.
Business associations also feared U.S. companies would fall victim to the bill as many of them have set up regional headquarters and offices in Hong Kong and used the metropolis as a base to explore other a wide range of Asia-Pacific markets.
The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong has called for support for Hong Kong's special status, saying that many U.S. businesses feared that the bill, with the sections addressing export controls and sanctions, could have counter-productive consequences on them.
Chairman of the Hong Kong Association of China Business Wong Ping also said U.S. enterprises will lose their most important and freest base in the Asia-Pacific if Hong Kong was rescinded its status as a separate customs territory because of the bill.
Wong pointed out that international economic relation is not about one side doing a favor for the other, warning that the United States might suffer greater losses once China takes up strong countermeasures.
Experts said while the U.S. legislation would certainly have an impact on Hong Kong's economy, it would not be a critical one. It is rather the implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, the huge mainland market and support from the central government that serves as the strongest impetus behind Hong Kong's development.
In the latest move of support, the mainland and HKSAR on Thursday updated an agreement on liberalization and facilitation of trade in services that lowers the mainland market access thresholds for Hong Kong enterprises and professionals.
The revised version of the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement Agreement, effective in June 2020, introduces new liberalization measures in a number of important services sectors such as financial services, legal services, television and tourism services.

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government invoked the power under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance to put in place the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation in October.
The Court of First Instance of the High Court of the HKSAR ruled on Monday that some provisions of the ordinance were incompatible with the Basic Law of the HKSAR and therefore were invalid.
A spokesperson of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) expressed deep concern over the ruling on Tuesday, saying the ordinance is consistent with the Basic Law and whether a law of the HKSAR is in conformity with the Basic Law can only be judged and decided by the NPC Standing Committee.
Legal experts here supported the remarks of the spokesperson and urged early correction of the ruling of the High Court.
Tam Yiu-chung, a member of the NPC Standing Committee, said the ruling challenged the legitimate power of the chief executive to govern in accordance with the law and will exert negative influence on Hong Kong in the long run.
The ruling actually winked at violent acts of masked rioters and made Hong Kong residents disappointed, he said.
Leung Mei-fun, a member of the HKSAR Basic Law Committee under the NPC Standing Committee, said the Emergency Regulations Ordinance was adopted as the law of the HKSAR, in accordance with Article 160 of the Basic Law of the HKSAR.
The chief executive has the obligation and power to refer to the ordinance in social unrest in Hong Kong, which is written into the Basic Law, Leung said, calling on the HKSAR government to appeal against the ruling.
Gu Minkang, former deputy dean of the law school of City University of Hong Kong, said the decision of the High Court was unconvincing amid the current grave situation in which public safety is in peril.
Gu also called on the HKSAR government to appeal to a higher court for correction and said that the NPC Standing Committee could actually make legal interpretation even before the self-correction of Hong Kong judiciary.
Ma Yan-kwok, barrister and chairman of the Hong Kong Legal Exchange Foundation, said the ruling only paid attention to the need of a small number of demonstrators but ignored the rights of the public to live a normal life free from masked rioters.
Hong Kong should put more emphasis on stopping violence and restoring order, Ma said.

The office will work to implement the president's requirements to firmly support the chief executive in leading the HKSAR government to govern in accordance with the law, firmly support the Hong Kong police in strictly enforcing the law, and firmly support the Hong Kong judicial bodies in severely punishing the violent criminals in accordance with the law, Yang said.     The spokesperson pledged various means of supporting and encouraging the Hong Kong people from all walks of life to build up ""overwhelming positive energy"" in countering violence and safeguarding the rule of law, and for the end of chaos and restoration of social stability in Hong Kong as soon as possible.     ""The central government and 1.4 billion people of China will always be the strongest backing for Hong Kong to overcome any challenges and risks,"" he said.

Xu expressed deep condolences for Ho and his colleagues, saying that the shocking attack was not only a serious criminal act but also pure election violence.

HONG KONG, Sept. 14 -- Hundreds of Hong Kong residents gathered at the Amoy Plaza in Kowloon on Saturday despite a heat wave, who sang China's national anthem to show their support to a teacher beaten by protesters for singing that song days ago.
The rally started at about 3:00 p.m. local time when the residents waved China's national flag and sang together, before chanting ""Police, keep it up!""
On the evening of Wednesday, a primary school teacher surnamed Lee walked into the Amoy Plaza with three kids. Disagreeing with the protesters, he sang the Chinese national anthem. The infuriated black-clad men punched him in the face, and his mobile phone was taken away.
In the Amoy Plaza on Saturday afternoon some residents held banners saying ""you will never sing alone.""
Yeung Man told Xinhua that her neighbor's kid was in Lee's class and she came voluntarily with nine others in the neighborhood to the rally.
""I would like to show my support to Lee, as well as the Hong Kong police,"" she said. ""I would also like to make our voices heard that we as Hong Kong residents want national unity and 'one country, two systems'.""
""Maybe I didn't have the courage like Lee in the past, but this time I decide to stand out,"" said a 38-year-old Mr. Tuan. ""Violence of the protesters have seriously affected our normal life, and we cannot continue keeping silent.""
During the gathering, protesters dressed in black and wearing face masks appeared outside the plaza. They shouted abusive words at the residents, who responded ""we don't have to wear masks.""
About five minutes later, police officers were called to the scene. Residents at the rally cheered while waving their national flags.
Some participants unfolded a banner that read ""no time to waste for us to protect Hong Kong; residents and police should join hands to work together.""
Ms. Chiu said that her daughter was among the protesters. ""I want to let them know, as a mother, that violence is bad.""
Ms. Yeung said that the protests, which have lasted for three months, tore apart the society. ""The protests sowed discord between friends, colleagues, classmates and even family members,"" she said. ""Some friends stopped speaking to each other, and colleagues poured vitriol to one another.""
She hoped that after the event, the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region could reflect on education. ""Many young people lack the knowledge of Chinese history and especially the Hong Kong history,"" she said. ""They know little about the Chinese mainland. So it is very easy for them to believe in rumors.""
Her view was shared by retiree Cheung Ming-wai. ""The negative information was exaggerated, so that many of the young people could hardly see the good side,"" she said.
She condemned the rioters for bringing chaos and fear to local residents. When violence finally erupted on Saturday afternoon around the Amoy Plaza, many stores on the street closed.

Hong Kong police shows an evidence image of violent acts by radical demonstrators during a daily press conference. 
HONG KONG, Sept. 4 -- When Ah Ho, 20, became a new constable of the Hong Kong Police Force in May, he did not expect that he and his colleagues would face a whole new level of danger, complexity and pressure on the job.
Hong Kong has since June suffered from prolonged and escalating violence that originated from demonstrations over proposed ordinance amendments concerning fugitive offenders.
Officers said the level of aggression by demonstrators has been the highest in decades, but in addition to their challenging work, the police also need to deal with intense hostility.
Ah Ho is among four officers who spoke to Xinhua about their experiences over the last three months. Their accounts shed light on the heavy pressure they have to endure, tricks of perpetrators to corner police, and the resolve of police to maintain law and order and fight street violence.
All officers declined to be named, citing worries over possible abuse of information.
BEING DOXXED
Ah Ho was one of the many victims of cyberbullying against police. On social networking platform Instagram, Ah Ho had disagreements with his friends over whether the police's responsive law-enforcing activities were appropriate, only to find later that he was targeted and maliciously doxxed.
Ah Ho and his family's identity cards, telephone numbers, home address and other private information were illegally and intentionally leaked online.
Within half a month, Ah Ho and his family received more than 3,900 harassment calls and were frequently abused verbally. His personal information and that of his family was illegally used to apply for loans, order takeaways, and hail taxis and Uber rides.
To date, the personal data of more than 1,800 police officers and their next-of-kin have been disclosed online since June, including pictures and information about the schools and classes of their children, according to statistics by the Hong Kong police.
The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data has transferred 608 doxxing cases to the police for further investigation, of which more than 70 percent were related to police officers.
Ah Ho, who serves in the patrol sub-unit in Kowloon West, said the malicious doxxing has greatly disturbed the lives of his family.
""But I will stay true to my heart. The reason why I chose to be a policeman remains unchanged, regardless of being doxxed or not,"" he said.
To help those affected officers, the welfare service group of the Hong Kong police has offered to change their living quarters and provide psychological counselling.
BEING AMBUSHED
Ah Kit faced far more dangerous situations during his frontline law-enforcing operations in his fourth year as a policeman.
The 23-year-old constable from the police tactical unit tried hard to remain calm when he recalled a late night duty call that turned out to be an ambush. On Aug. 25, radical demonstrators illegally besieged the Kwai Chung police station in the New Territories.
Inside the police station, a telephone call came in to report that ""a citizen"" had been beaten by a number of violent demonstrators and needed help. Ah Kit's police squad was dispatched to mount a rescue operation.
The moment the officers stepped out, they were attacked by a large number of rioters with iron rods, corrosive liquids and bricks, objects that have been frequently used by rioters to attack police officers.
Caught off guard, Ah Kit and another colleague found themselves separated from eight other officers and greatly outnumbered by rioters. They were robbed of their helmets, beaten and kicked. They wielded their batons to defend themselves and retreated.
During the process, a ""reporter"" clad in a yellow vest offered to take Ah Kit and his colleague to where the so-called attack took place. They followed him around but found no trace of any attack that had taken place.
When they arrived at the Kwai Fong MTR station, officers were told by a local resident that the man in the yellow vest was a fake journalist. As they retreated to the Kwai Fong bus station, they met another squad which had also been dispatched over a fake call for help.
Together, they continued searching, but a mob began to attack their vehicle, smashing the car windows and assaulting the driver, who suffered serious stab wounds in the back.
Ah Kit and his colleagues escorted the injured officer for treatment. He had been pelted with eggs, his arms and feet injured by broken glass and corrosive liquids.
""A lot of the rioters were my age, but the bottom line is very clear -- if they break the law, whoever they are, I will arrest them, even if they are my friends,"" he said.
""I don't regret it because I'm a cop,"" he said. ""It's my job to crack down on violence and protect the people. It's the right thing to do, and I will stick to it.""
The public has expressed strong discontent over the rampant violence, said officer Chan who is in charge of community relations in Sham Shui Po District.
After some applied a demonstration in Sham Shui Po on Aug. 11, the police district received more than 600 letters in the name of institutions demanding a letter of objection.
""I believe the mainstream opinion in the community is to uphold law and order,"" Chan said, adding that he understands the silence of many members of the public for fear of revenge.
""But that doesn't mean they're endorsing violence,"" he said.
People also provided information to police about parking lots and warehouses used by rioters to allow the police to raid beforehand, Chan said.
Since Aug. 5, the district has suffered ten attacks by rioters. Radical demonstrators often assembled illegally in the neighborhoods and shouted slogans late at night.
""Many residents were unable to sleep well at night. Many stores in the district saw their sales plunge about 50 percent over the past two months,"" said Chan.
MORALE STILL HIGH
Officer Au has been serving in the police force for 21 years and handled the illegal ""Occupy Central"" movement in 2014. ""But the illegal, violent activities this time are tougher to deal with,"" said Au, deputy commander of a regional response contingent.
Rioters blocked roads, dismantled roadside railings, built barricades and attacked police officers with bricks, iron rods, corrosive liquids and petrol bombs. They even used slingshots to shoot arrows and steel balls at police officers.
Many police officers are also under huge pressure due to smear campaigns against them. Radicals spread rumors and adulterated photos on social media to smear police operations and accuse them of so-called ""abuse of power,"" Au said.
On Aug. 22, the Hong Kong police presented clear evidence of adulterated photos and videos of police reactions to demonstrations. A photo of an officer hitting non-demonstrators with his shield had been widely used as proof of police brutality. Video footage later revealed that the officer was holding his shield to escort passersby out of the danger zone.
As a regional response contingent's deputy commander, Au said he would make proper rotations and deploy tactics based on received intelligence to make sure every district has sufficient police personnel to deal with the surprise attacks.
He reiterated that if demonstrators do not resort to violence, the police will not use force.
More than 200 police officers have been injured amid violence since early June, and 1,183 suspects have been arrested.
""Our morale is still high,"" Au said, ""Without such morale, we couldn't have had handled so many emergency situations in such a short time.""

This flip flop by the United States might at first seem confusing, but it’s not hard to spot a pattern in Washington’s behavior. When the trade talks are going well, Washington seems content to stay out of China's internal affairs. But when the talks run into trouble, Washington tries to drag the Hong Kong issue into the trade negotiations. This shows that Washington doesn't really care about the people in Hong Kong. Rather, it is using the situation in Hong Kong as leverage for its own purposes.
The affairs of Hong Kong are part of China's internal affairs. China’s government is entitled to exercise sovereignty over Hong Kong in accordance with the country’s Constitution and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and it is entitled to do so without interference by external forces. Since Washington has acknowledged that Hong Kong is a part of China, and that China should solve the problems in Hong Kong on its own, it should stop trying to link the Hong Kong situation with the China-U.S. trade negotiations.
China has consistently advocated that unrelated issues should not be dragged into the trade talks. They’re already complicated enough as it is, especially now that Washington has said it will impose even more import tariffs on goods from China. This raises the risk that the dispute will lead to greater adverse impacts for both sides and the world at large. The U.S. Commerce Department on Thursday lowered its estimate for economic growth in the United States to 2 percent in the second quarter, down from 3.1 percent in the first quarter. The American households will feel the pinch: the average household budget will be up to 1,000 U.S. dollars a year worse off because of the tariffs, according to research by JP Morgan Chase.
""When it comes to trade policy, the Trump Administration is in a hole that it keeps digging deeper,” said Bryan Riley from the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. “A good first step would be to stop digging by imposing a moratorium on any new taxes, including tariffs that weaken the U.S. economy. Even better, the White House should remove its ineffective and self-destructive tariffs.""
Under the mounting pressure on the domestic economy, some voices in Washington are calling for another round of face-to-face talks with China. Beijing is willing to resolve the trade issues through consultation and cooperation, and has maintained effective communication with the American negotiators. It also believes that an urgent task for Washington is to stop the introduction of further tariffs on 550 billion U.S. dollars of goods from China, in order to prevent a further escalation of the dispute.
Negotiation requires the participation of both parties, who need to be willing to meet each other half way. The United States should return to the negotiating table so that both sides can work through the economic and trade frictions in a spirit of equality and mutual respect.
As for the Hong Kong situation, Washington needs to clearly distinguish political issues from economic ones. The trade talks should be about just trade. Any attempt to use the Hong Kong issue as a bargaining chip will not succeed. On Friday, the administration in Washington attempted to link progress in the China-U.S. trade talks with the situation in Hong Kong, despite only a month ago acknowledging that it was an internal affair for China. This flip flop by the United States might at first seem confusing, but it’s not hard to spot a pattern in Washington’s behavior. When the trade talks are going well, Washington seems content to stay out of China's internal affairs. But when the talks run into trouble, Washington tries to drag the Hong Kong issue into the trade negotiations. This shows that Washington doesn't really care about the people in Hong Kong. Rather, it is using the situation in Hong Kong as leverage for its own purposes. The affairs of Hong Kong are part of China's internal affairs. China’s government is entitled to exercise sovereignty over Hong Kong in accordance with the country’s Constitution and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and it is entitled to do so without interference by external forces. Since Washington has acknowledged that Hong Kong is a part of China, and that China should solve the problems in Hong Kong on its own, it should stop trying to link the Hong Kong situation with the China-U.S. trade negotiations. China has consistently advocated that unrelated issues should not be dragged into the trade talks. They’re already complicated enough as it is, especially now that Washington has said it will impose even more import tariffs on goods from China. This raises the risk that the dispute will lead to greater adverse impacts for both sides and the world at large. The U.S. Commerce Department on Thursday lowered its estimate for economic growth in the United States to 2 percent in the second quarter, down from 3.1 percent in the first quarter. The American households will feel the pinch: the average household budget will be up to 1,000 U.S. dollars a year worse off because of the tariffs, according to research by JP Morgan Chase. ""When it comes to trade policy, the Trump Administration is in a hole that it keeps digging deeper,” said Bryan Riley from the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. “A good first step would be to stop digging by imposing a moratorium on any new taxes, including tariffs that weaken the U.S. economy. Even better, the White House should remove its ineffective and self-destructive tariffs."" Under the mounting pressure on the domestic economy, some voices in Washington are calling for another round of face-to-face talks with China. Beijing is willing to resolve the trade issues through consultation and cooperation, and has maintained effective communication with the American negotiators. It also believes that an urgent task for Washington is to stop the introduction of further tariffs on 550 billion U.S. dollars of goods from China, in order to prevent a further escalation of the dispute. Negotiation requires the participation of both parties, who need to be willing to meet each other half way. The United States should return to the negotiating table so that both sides can work through the economic and trade frictions in a spirit of equality and mutual respect. As for the Hong Kong situation, Washington needs to clearly distinguish political issues from economic ones. The trade talks should be about just trade. Any attempt to use the Hong Kong issue as a bargaining chip will not succeed."	CCTV

Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang made the remarks at a daily press briefing.
The G7 reportedly reaffirmed the existence and the importance of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong and called for avoiding violence in a joint statement issued Monday at the end of a G7 summit held in Biarritz, France.
""As we have emphasized on many occasions, Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs, and no foreign governments, organizations or individuals have the right to intervene,"" said Geng, when responding to a query about China's comment on the statement from the G7 summit.
The demonstrations and violent protests have been running in Hong Kong for more than two months, and Hong Kong's rule of law, social order, economy and wellbeing of the people, as well as its international image have been severely impacted as a result, Geng said.
""No one cares more about Hong Kong's prosperity and stability than Chinese people, including residents of Hong Kong,"" Geng said. ""(Those) are our own affairs, we will handle them well. G7 members should not poke their noses into others' business with ill-harbored intentions and conspiracies.""

""Since Hong Kong returned to the motherland in 1997, the Chinese government has exercised jurisdiction over Hong Kong according to the Constitution and the Basic Law,"" he said.

(Xinhua/Huang Heng)
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 25 -- Hundreds of Chinese held a peaceful rally Sunday morning to support Hong Kong as an indisputable part of China and oppose violence in the special administrative region.
Waving placards saying ""No Riots in Hong Kong"" in Monterey Park, an East Los Angeles suburban city, the participants, including white-collar workers, business owners and students, all expressed concern and said the violence by radical protesters in Hong Kong over the past weeks should by no means be tolerated.
""In America, you can not touch a policeman. That's number one important. Those protesters in Hong Kong must stop attacking policemen, reporters and other tourists,"" Jessica Hu, chairperson of U.S.-China Economic & Cultural Organization, told Xinhua.
""You have problems? You want to complain about something? It's okay. But you need to sit down first,"" Hu said.
The Hong Kong policemen ""need to be strong,"" she added. ""If not, all will be hurt.""
Hu's husband Steven Fk, standing by her, said he and Hu talked about the turmoil in Hong Kong every day and the escalating violence has worried both of them.
Fk said the protesters' anti-social and violent actions had stepped out of the line, as similar attacks, if happens in the United States, could not be tolerated.
""If you grabbed a policeman's weapon here, you will be killed on scene. If you tried to occupy the airport, you will be arrested here. You must understand the Hong Kong policemen are very nice. Maybe they are too nice,"" said Lu Qiang, owner of local Chinese restaurant Shanghai Lander Palace, who has lived in Los Angeles for over 20 years.
The violence committed by the rioters in Hong Kong must be stopped and moreover, any attempt by extremists in the special administrative region of China to promote the so-called ""Hong Kong Independence"" must be rejected, said Lu, who was also one of the organizers of Sunday's rally.
Shao Wen, president of the Chinese American Federation and another organizer of the rally, said the turmoil in Hong Kong, showing traits of the Color Revolution, has blatantly challenged the ""one country, two systems"" principle governing Hong Kong.
The local Chinese community has expressed great concerns over the situation in Hong Kong and they resolutely oppose any attempt to create chaos in the Chinese city, Shao said.
The extreme methods by rioters ""in attempts to kidnap Hong Kong in order to achieve ulterior political goals will not be tolerated,"" Shao said.
""All those who care about the future of Hong Kong should stand firm at the moment, and say no to all criminal acts, say no to all violent elements,"" he said.

At about 8 p.m., a group of protesters detained a traveler they claimed to be an undercover police officer from the Chinese mainland.
In lynch mob-style assaults, they repeatedly kicked and punched the man, tied his wrists together and pulled his identity documents from his wallet.
For nearly four hours, dozens of radical protestors attacked the man before he passed out. They even obstructed an ambulance crew from taking him to hospital.
Later, the protesters besieged and assaulted another man they claimed to be a fake reporter masquerading as a protester. Again, they beat him, tied his wrists together and continued assaulting him even as he was being taken away by paramedics on a stretcher.
Chinese newspaper the Global Times has confirmed the man is one of its reporters.
During an unpermitted rally at the airport terminal earlier in the day, they cursed and assaulted passengers and prevented them from departing, paralyzing for the second day the operations of the busy airport.
Such brutal and shameful acts are a flagrant violation of basic human rights, overstepping the bottom line of a civilized society.
The radicals' violent attacks on innocent citizens are tantamount to an act of terrorism that should be condemned in the strongest terms possible.
Their illegal detainment and brutal beating of a journalist is also an insult to the global press community and a serious violation of the freedom of the press.
On Wednesday, some protesters attempted to gloss over their atrocities by putting up half-hearted ""sorry"" signs, using soft language such as ""imperfect decisions.""
It is naive and absurd to think one can act with impunity. The only way for them to atone for their brutalities is to face the punishment by law.

For nearly four hours, dozens of radical protestors attacked the man before he passed out. They even obstructed an ambulance crew from taking him to hospital. Later, the protesters besieged and assaulted another man they claimed to be a fake reporter masquerading as a protester. Again, they beat him, tied his wrists together and continued assaulting him even as he was being taken away by paramedics on a stretcher. Chinese newspaper the Global Times has confirmed the man is one of its reporters. During an unpermitted rally at the airport terminal earlier in the day, they cursed and assaulted passengers and prevented them from departing, paralyzing for the second day the operations of the busy airport. Such brutal and shameful acts are a flagrant violation of basic human rights, overstepping the bottom line of a civilized society. The radicals' violent attacks on innocent citizens are tantamount to an act of terrorism that should be condemned in the strongest terms possible. Their illegal detainment and brutal beating of a journalist is also an insult to the global press community and a serious violation of the freedom of the press. On Wednesday, some protesters attempted to gloss over their atrocities by putting up half-hearted ""sorry"" signs, using soft language such as ""imperfect decisions."" It is naive and absurd to think one can act with impunity. The only way for them to atone for their brutalities is to face the punishment by law. Undoubtedly, the episode at the airport will be remembered in history as a stigma of Hong Kong. "	CCTV

HONG KONG, Aug. 9 -- The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Garrison in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Friday held a voluntary blood donation activity, as part of its continuing efforts to contribute to Hong Kong society and residents.
The activity, the 22nd of its kind, saw nearly 400 service members donate about 160,000 milliliters of blood.
""I donated 350 milliliters,"" said Wang Shasha, a female soldier. ""I feel really happy to do my part to help those in need in Hong Kong.""
Shi Xi, another female soldier, has participated in two blood donation activities.
""I made two donations because I think this is of great significance,"" Shi said. ""I met many Hong Kong residents in the garrison's public service activities and they were very nice to us. I'd like to do more things for them.""

The Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed by China and the United Kingdom in 1984. It lays out the arrangements for the resumption of China's sovereignty over Hong Kong and provides details about the transition period. After Hong Kong's return to China on July 1, 1997, the rights and obligations stipulated in the statement related to the British side were fulfilled and the statement became a historical document. To argue otherwise, if not because of ignorance of history and politics, is an attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs.
It has also been claimed by some people in the United Kingdom that the freedom of the people of Hong Kong was won by the British. British scholar Martin Jacques says this is an example of British hypocrisy. Under colonial rule, Hong Kong “never enjoyed even a semblance of democracy. It was ruled from 6,000 miles away in London,"" he said. During the colonial period, Hong Kong governors were appointed by Britain, the Hong Kong people never had a right to vote, and the local judiciary was not independent.
After the handover of Hong Kong, China’s government implemented the policies of ""one country, two systems"" and ""Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy"" in accordance with China's Constitution and Hong Kong’s Basic Law. Under this arrangement, the people of Hong Kong have enjoyed unprecedented democratic rights and freedoms. According to data released by the World Bank, Hong Kong's global rule of law ranking jumped from 60th place in 1996 to 11th in 2015. Hong Kong is arguably more free and democratic now than it ever has been.
As for the handling of the recent protests, the government in Hong Kong has addressed the incidents of violence in accordance with the law. The Basic Law does give Hong Kong residents the freedoms of speech, assembly, and demonstration. These freedoms do not, however, negate the need for protesters to respect the rights of others and to ensure that public safety and order are upheld. Nor do these freedoms give protesters the right to break the law, commit acts of violence, or trample on the rule of law.
Twenty-two years have passed since British colonialism in Hong Kong ended, China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over the region, and Hong Kong affairs became an internal matter for China. If the relationship between China and the United Kingdom is to remain healthy, it must be fostered in an atmosphere of mutual respect and the understanding that neither side has the right to interfere in the other’s internal affairs.

""He seems to be fantasizing in the faded glory of British colonialism and obsessed with the bad habit of criticizing and lecturing on other countries' affairs condescendingly,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said at a daily press briefing.
Geng said China has lodged stern representations with Britain over Hunt's comments.
According to The Times, Hunt said on Tuesday that he expected China to honor the Sino-British Joint Declaration, a treaty signed in 1984 when Margaret Thatcher was the prime minister, and that ""there will be serious consequences if that internationally binding legal agreement were not to be honored.""
Geng said as Hong Kong returned to the motherland, the rights and obligations of the British side under the Joint Declaration were completely fulfilled.
On July 1, 1997, China resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong and the Chinese government started administering it in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law, said Geng.
""The British side has no sovereignty over Hong Kong, nor does it have administrative power or supervisory power since its return. It has no so-called responsibility for Hong Kong at all,"" said Geng, calling it ""sheer delusion with mawkish sentimentality"" for the British side to ""consider itself as a guardian.""
""It is just shameless to say that the freedom of Hong Kong residents is negotiated for them by the British side,"" Geng said.
Geng said he wanted to remind Hunt that Hong Kong had no democracy at all during the British colonial rule, and the Hong Kong people had not even the rights to take to the streets to protest.
It is the Chinese government that protects Hong Kong people's rights of democracy and freedom in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law and fully implements the principles of ""one country, two systems,"" Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong and a high degree of autonomy, said Geng.
In response to Hunt's remarks that the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) should not use the storming of the region's Legislative Council (LegCo) Complex by demonstrators as a pretext to ""repress"" its people, Geng said Hunt was calling black white by saying so as the storming of the LegCo Complex on July 1 was severe violation of law, Geng said.
Stressing that Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs that brook no foreign interference, Geng said China advises Britain, especially Hunt, to stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs as it is doomed to fail.  BEIJING, July 3 -- China on Wednesday expressed strong dissatisfaction with and firm opposition to the recent comments on Hong Kong made by British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, urging him to stop wanton interference in Hong Kong affairs.

On July 1, 1997, China resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong and the Chinese government started administering it in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law, said Geng. ""The British side has no sovereignty over Hong Kong, nor does it have administrative power or supervisory power since its return. It has no so-called responsibility for Hong Kong at all,"" said Geng, calling it ""sheer delusion with mawkish sentimentality"" for the British side to ""consider itself as a guardian."" ""It is just shameless to say that the freedom of Hong Kong residents is negotiated for them by the British side,"" Geng said. Geng said he wanted to remind Hunt that Hong Kong had no democracy at all during the British colonial rule, and the Hong Kong people had not even the rights to take to the streets to protest. It is the Chinese government that protects Hong Kong people's rights of democracy and freedom in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law and fully implements the principles of ""one country, two systems,"" Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong and a high degree of autonomy, said Geng. In response to Hunt's remarks that the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) should not use the storming of the region's Legislative Council (LegCo) Complex by demonstrators as a pretext to ""repress"" its people, Geng said Hunt was calling black white by saying so as the storming of the LegCo Complex on July 1 was severe violation of law, Geng said. Stressing that Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs that brook no foreign interference, Geng said China advises Britain, especially Hunt, to stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs as it is doomed to fail. "	CCTV

Radical protesters attack police officers in Tsuen Wan, in the western New Territories of south China's Hong Kong, Aug. 25, 2019. (Xinhua/Lui Siu Wai)
HONG KONG, Aug. 27 -- On a rainy August evening, police officers carrying shields faced off with violent protesters who recklessly threw bricks and petrol bombs at them. As officers were ready to disperse them, many charged on and assailed them with metal rods.
The scene on Sunday evening was one of the most violent in Hong Kong since the protests began in June. Over the weekend, 21 police officers were injured, and one suffered heavy stab wounds to his back. The new casualties brought the number of officer injuries to over 200 since June 9.
""These radical acts are intentional, planned and organized... Such reckless use of violence placed everyone in immense danger,"" said Mak Chin-ho, assistant commissioner of police on Monday.
COMBATING VIOLENCE
Since June 9, violent protesters have harrowed Hong Kong through confrontations with police and extensive vandalism. They have deliberately attacked police, besieged police stations, sabotaged public facilities and assaulted innocent people, forcing officers to respond to prevent further destruction.
Over the last few weeks, police stations were attacked over 75 times. Radical protesters committed arson near police compounds. Police found explosives, petrol bombs and other deadly weapons suspected to belong to protesters.
Chief Superintendent David Jordan said the situation on the front line is the most dangerous he has encountered in his 25 years on the job due to the level of aggression.
Over the past weekend, radical protesters not only repeatedly clashed with police, but also randomly smashed multiple shops, traffic lights and smart lampposts, and beat up innocent passersby.
On Sunday, over 100 rioters armed with offensive weapons surrounded and attacked police officers, many of whom sustained multiple serious injuries, with their helmets, shoes and other protective gear smashed. Video footage showed that at one point, an officer fell to the ground, but rioters still brutally charged at him. One officer fired a warning shot into the air, police said.
The drawn-out violent protests, carried out in a guerilla style, have exhausted police officers. Some have to work up to 20 hours a day.
Wong Ka-lun, senior inspector of No. 4 Platoon of the Emergency Unit of the Kowloon East Region, was hit in the mouth by a steel ball fired from a slingshot by violent protesters on Aug. 5.
""I was trying to subdue a violent protester when the ball hit me. It hurt so much, but I had to stick to my duty and assist my colleagues in retreating to a safe area,"" he said.
Wong said the front line situation is becoming extremely precarious. ""We often face an escalation of hostility in protests. First, they threw bricks, and then they used deadly means such as self-made petrol bombs.""
The officer said his duty has given him great courage. ""It is an honor to serve on the force. We will continue to work hard to safeguard law and order,"" he said.
The Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) has been the backbone of safety, stability and the rule of law in Hong Kong. Renowned as one of the world's finest forces, it has over 30,000 disciplined officers, supported by about 4,600 civilian officers.
Hong Kong remained one of the world's safest cities until the recent chaos. It ranked the sixth out of 140 countries and regions in the reliability of police services in the 2018 Global Competitiveness Report published by the World Economic Forum.
""As police officers, we will continue to stand firm and carry out our duties faithfully, diligently and impartially. We pledge to every member of the public to bring all offenders to justice and do our best to restore public order,"" said Mak.
SMEAR TACTIC AGAINST POLICE
Apart from risking their lives on the front line, police have to fight another battle against abuse. ""Police officers have endured finger-pointing, humiliation and attacks by violent protesters in endless acts of revenge,"" said Lam Chi-wai, chairman of the Junior Police Officers' Association.
Protest organizers have launched an extensive campaign to discredit the HKPF. They criticized reasonable police reactions to protests as abuse of force, spread rumors about officers and propounded negative propaganda. Some media reports, by highlighting ""police brutality,"" sympathized with violent protesters and antagonized the public and police.
On Aug. 22, the Hong Kong police presented clear evidence of adulterated photos and videos of police reactions to protests. A photo of an officer hitting non-protestors with his shield had been widely used as proof of police brutality. Video footage later revealed that the officer was holding his shield to escort passersby out of the danger zone.
The discrediting campaign was not only directed at officers but also their families.
The personal data of 1,614 police officers and their family members, including names, phone numbers, home addresses and pictures, were illegally disclosed online since June, said Swalikh Mohammed, superintendent of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau on Aug. 22. Officers and their families received harassing phone calls and letters of intimidation following the leak.
Radical opinions and hatred have also spread to the educational field, in which children of officers risk being bullied at schools.
Officer Jordan said his 13-year-old daughter was told by her teacher she should be ashamed of her father. ""I've been trolled, abused, and received anonymous attacks on Facebook... As a police officer in uniform, you can identify me with my job, but if you take aim at my wife and children, that is totally unacceptable in any civilized society,"" he said.
In one extreme post, a staff member of the Logos Academy in Hong Kong wrote that ""the children of police officers shall not live longer than seven years.""
""I just received a message that says that they are collecting information about the kids of police officers, and they will 'do something' in early September,"" said Horace Cheung, a member of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Cheung helped set up a group to prevent school bullying.
RESTRAINT, PROFESSIONALISM
Facing frenzied protesters, Hong Kong police have shown restraint and professionalism.
""The role and the actions of the Hong Kong police have been as tolerant as any other police force on the planet would have been. A lot of other police forces would have acted far more productively and possibly aggressively against this kind of situation,"" Jordan said.
As protests often evolved into assaults against police officers, at times officers have been compelled to use minimum force, such as tear gas and batons, to prevent further destruction.
But before they deploy, the police usually allow some disruption, which is an incredible amount of tolerance for an international city police force, said Jordan.
Yeung Man-pun, a police officer of Kowloon City District, reaffirmed that if there are no violent attacks at police lines, officers will not respond with force. On one occasion, a police officer helped a female protester who injured herself while throwing corrosive liquid at him.
After Sunday's marches in Tsuen Wan in the New Territories of Hong Kong, police repeatedly unfurled posters urging demonstrators to leave. First, they warned members of illegal rallies to disperse, but radical protesters ignored their warnings. Later police raised placards forecasting tear gas. Still, protesters refused to leave. A police commander at the scene ordered the deployment of two specialized crowd management vehicles, commonly known as ""water cannon vehicles,"" to remove road barricades.
SUPPORT FOR POLICE
According to a police service satisfaction survey carried out by Hong Kong University in 2018, 84 percent of respondents were very or quite satisfied with the overall service performance of the HKPF, the highest percentage since the inception of the survey in 2000. Close to 80 percent of respondents were confident in the HKPF, also the highest ever percentage.
The high ratings have shown the efforts made to improve police services have been well-received by the public, said the survey, conducted roughly every three years.
The elite Hong Kong police force deserves respect, many said, denouncing the mounting attacks on police. The HKSAR government has firmly supported the police and opposed unjust accusations of brutality against officers. Residents have visited police stations to express their gratitude and support.
Maggie Chan Man-ki, solicitor and founding president of the Small and Medium Law Firms Association of Hong Kong, said those who accuse police of abuse are distorting facts.
""People should be concerned about who started the violence, and not how police enforce the law. If we don't respect the law and support the police, Hong Kong will descend into total chaos,"" she said.
During a public rally on Monday, many Hong Kong residents said they stand by the police.
""The violence is getting worse, and many police officers are injured. I think the government and police should take a stronger stance against violence,"" said Jimmy Tso, a rally organizer.
The order of Hong Kong not only depends on the enforcement of the law by the police, but also on law-abiding residents cooperating with the police, said Chan Man-tak, chairman of the Superintendents' Association of the HKPF.
""There is no excuse to rationalize any violent and illegal actions,"" he said.  Radical protesters attack police officers in Tsuen Wan, in the western New Territories of south China's Hong Kong, Aug. 25, 2019. (Xinhua/Lui Siu Wai) HONG KONG, Aug. 27 -- On a rainy August evening, police officers carrying shields faced off with violent protesters who recklessly threw bricks and petrol bombs at them. As officers were ready to disperse them, many charged on and assailed them with metal rods. The scene on Sunday evening was one of the most violent in Hong Kong since the protests began in June. Over the weekend, 21 police officers were injured, and one suffered heavy stab wounds to his back. The new casualties brought the number of officer injuries to over 200 since June 9. ""These radical acts are intentional, planned and organized... Such reckless use of violence placed everyone in immense danger,"" said Mak Chin-ho, assistant commissioner of police on Monday. COMBATING VIOLENCE Since June 9, violent protesters have harrowed Hong Kong through confrontations with police and extensive vandalism. They have deliberately attacked police, besieged police stations, sabotaged public facilities and assaulted innocent people, forcing officers to respond to prevent further destruction. Over the last few weeks, police stations were attacked over 75 times. Radical protesters committed arson near police compounds. Police found explosives, petrol bombs and other deadly weapons suspected to belong to protesters. Chief Superintendent David Jordan said the situation on the front line is the most dangerous he has encountered in his 25 years on the job due to the level of aggression. Over the past weekend, radical protesters not only repeatedly clashed with police, but also randomly smashed multiple shops, traffic lights and smart lampposts, and beat up innocent passersby. On Sunday, over 100 rioters armed with offensive weapons surrounded and attacked police officers, many of whom sustained multiple serious injuries, with their helmets, shoes and other protective gear smashed. Video footage showed that at one point, an officer fell to the ground, but rioters still brutally charged at him. One officer fired a warning shot into the air, police said. The drawn-out violent protests, carried out in a guerilla style, have exhausted police officers. Some have to work up to 20 hours a day. Wong Ka-lun, senior inspector of No. 4 Platoon of the Emergency Unit of the Kowloon East Region, was hit in the mouth by a steel ball fired from a slingshot by violent protesters on Aug. 5. ""I was trying to subdue a violent protester when the ball hit me. It hurt so much, but I had to stick to my duty and assist my colleagues in retreating to a safe area,"" he said. Wong said the front line situation is becoming extremely precarious. ""We often face an escalation of hostility in protests. First, they threw bricks, and then they used deadly means such as self-made petrol bombs."" The officer said his duty has given him great courage. ""It is an honor to serve on the force. We will continue to work hard to safeguard law and order,"" he said. The Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) has been the backbone of safety, stability and the rule of law in Hong Kong. Renowned as one of the world's finest forces, it has over 30,000 disciplined officers, supported by about 4,600 civilian officers. Hong Kong remained one of the world's safest cities until the recent chaos. It ranked the sixth out of 140 countries and regions in the reliability of police services in the 2018 Global Competitiveness Report published by the World Economic Forum. ""As police officers, we will continue to stand firm and carry out our duties faithfully, diligently and impartially. We pledge to every member of the public to bring all offenders to justice and do our best to restore public order,"" said Mak. SMEAR TACTIC AGAINST POLICE Apart from risking their lives on the front line, police have to fight another battle against abuse. ""Police officers have endured finger-pointing, humiliation and attacks by violent protesters in endless acts of revenge,"" said Lam Chi-wai, chairman of the Junior Police Officers' Association. Protest organizers have launched an extensive campaign to discredit the HKPF. They criticized reasonable police reactions to protests as abuse of force, spread rumors about officers and propounded negative propaganda. Some media reports, by highlighting ""police brutality,"" sympathized with violent protesters and antagonized the public and police. On Aug. 22, the Hong Kong police presented clear evidence of adulterated photos and videos of police reactions to protests. A photo of an officer hitting non-protestors with his shield had been widely used as proof of police brutality. Video footage later revealed that the officer was holding his shield to escort passersby out of the danger zone. The discrediting campaign was not only directed at officers but also their families. The personal data of 1,614 police officers and their family members, including names, phone numbers, home addresses and pictures, were illegally disclosed online since June, said Swalikh Mohammed, superintendent of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau on Aug. 22. Officers and their families received harassing phone calls and letters of intimidation following the leak. Radical opinions and hatred have also spread to the educational field, in which children of officers risk being bullied at schools. Officer Jordan said his 13-year-old daughter was told by her teacher she should be ashamed of her father. ""I've been trolled, abused, and received anonymous attacks on Facebook... As a police officer in uniform, you can identify me with my job, but if you take aim at my wife and children, that is totally unacceptable in any civilized society,"" he said.

Citizens present a hand-written card as a gift to a police officer at Kwun Tong Police Station in Hong Kong, south China, Aug. 10, 2019. (Xinhua/Lui Siu Wai)
HONG KONG, Aug. 10 -- Large groups of Hong Kong people visited several police stations in Hong Kong Saturday to express their firm support for and utmost respect to the police force.
The scene stood in stark contrast to the chaotic and violent besieges of police stations by black-clad protesters on many nights over the past weeks.
""The police have been working really hard to safeguard social order. We came here to show our support,"" said a resident surnamed Chan, who visited Kwai Chung Police Station with his wife and son. The boy gave the police a hand-written card as a gift.
""I hope our children can learn to love peace and how to act as righteous people,"" Chan said. ""I also want to see society restore order and for there to be no more violence.""
Local business leader Raymond Tsoi Chi-chung and his friends visited Central Police Station to express their support to the ""core force for protecting Hong Kong.""
""Recent violent incidents have reduced Hong Kong to an economic trough,"" Tsoi said. ""I hope Hong Kong people can focus on stabilizing the economy.""
A police officer surnamed Lau has become an internet celebrity after a video went viral showing him confronting a crowd of protesters that had surrounded and attacked him.
""Hong Kong police are capable of coping with the mobsters, but it has torn my heart out either to hit them or not, as they are also Chinese,"" said Lau in a text message to a reporter, which drew immense online support for both his bravery and compassion.
Carrie Lam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), on Friday visited Wong Tai Sin Police Station and dormitory quarters which had been attacked by radical protesters. Lam expressed thanks to the police personnel for their hard work to safeguard public security in Hong Kong.
Lam also demanded renovation of the damaged buildings and heightened security in the dormitory quarters to give the peace back to the police families.
PROFESSIONAL AND RESTRAINED
Over the past two months, the Hong Kong police have been praised for showing professionalism and exercising restraint with the use of appropriate force to cope with violent protests.
""The approach the police adopted to dealing with violence is appropriate and balanced,"" said Chan Man Ki, founding president of the Small and Medium Law Firms Association of Hong Kong.
Chan noted that far from rallying in a peaceful manner, the protesters have committed various offenses on the street, ranging from setting fires and throwing rocks and iron bars at the police to using offensive weapons, including explosives and homemade sharp objects, and besieging police stations.
""Facing violence of such degree, the police had every right to use appropriate force in an effort to end violence and protect public safety,"" said the legal expert.
During the protests, police officers balanced the exercise of the right to freedom of speech for protesters and the right of other people to use the roads, a Hong Kong police officer told Xinhua.
But police were mandated to take action when crimes were committed, said the officer, who declined to be named or disclose his rank.
""All the duties assigned to on-site police officers bear one characteristic: totally not proactive,"" he said.
The officer said he saw in person one of his colleagues hit hard by a protester in the face.
""Part of his eyeball collapsed, which severely affected his eyesight. The injury may be permanent,"" he said.
In response to the attacks, the police officer said his colleagues only resorted to the minimum use of force, such as using batons, tear gas and rubber rounds to disperse the crowd. ""We never used any lethal or deadly weapon against the protestors.""
Elsie Leung, former secretary for justice of the HKSAR government, said various actions of the protesters have gone far beyond the realm of peaceful demonstrations -- ranging from storming and vandalizing the Legislative Council building and storming the institution of the central government in Hong Kong to paralyzing the transport network and assaulting the police force with bricks and petrol bombs.
""No one is above the law,"" she said, stressing that all the offenders should be brought to justice.
ENORMOUS STRESS
While battling to contain violence on the street, Hong Kong police officers had to face online assault, enduring all sorts of ridicule, humiliation and even threats.
""Many police officers are working more than 10 hours each day. They are also under tremendous mental stress for being assaulted by the radicals on social media,"" said Lam Chi-wai, chairman of the Junior Police Officers' Association of the Hong Kong Police Force.
""Even so, they are still working hard and sparing no effort to safeguard social stability,"" Lam said.
""We are facing a very serious situation of harassment on ourselves and family members, including kids,"" the unnamed police officer said. ""We were being attacked at every angle imaginable.""
In some online chat groups, the radicals used abusive language against the police, drew caricatures and made videos to embarrass them and even revealed their personal information as a way of intimidation and threat.
The enormous workload and stress on the police officers have taken a toll on their families members.
During a recent rally held by police supporters, organizers played an audio clip featuring the worrying wife of a police officer.
""As the spouse of a police officer, I couldn't sleep many nights and don't know what to do,"" she said. ""But I feel obliged to speak out (against violence).""
The audio clip ended with the sound of a little girl asking, ""Daddy, when are you coming home?""
A Hong Kong resident surnamed Wong said many of her family members are working on the police force, and she felt heartsore to see them work day and night to keep public order.
""I hope the chaotic situation will subside and we can get back to our normal days as soon as possible,"" she said.
The central authorities have also expressed unswerving support for the Hong Kong police.
At a press conference in late July, Yang Guang, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, expressed understanding for the Hong Kong police force and their families for the tremendous stress they have been under.
""I'd like to take this opportunity to pay our high respect to the outstanding Hong Kong police officers who have been on the job, performed their duties, showed no fear, and endured a lot of humiliation,"" said Yang.

The illegal assembly was held in the Western District on Hong Kong Island on Sunday, during which the protesters set up roadblocks by umbrellas, wooden planks, bamboo sticks and railings, pried up pavement bricks, demolished roadside fences and damaged street signs and lampposts, according to the police. They also attacked police officers at scene with lethal weapons such as bricks and sharpened iron rods.
Although the police repeatedly asked the protesters who charged the police cordon lines to leave the illegal assembly immediately, the protesters continued to perform various peace-breaching acts and attacked police officers.
After repeated warnings were ignored, the police took dispersal action at around 7 p.m. on Sunday to restore social order, during which the police arrested 49 people including 32 men and 17 women, aged between 16 and 41.

The spokesperson of the U.S. State Department made unwarranted remarks and voiced ""concern"" about the Hong Kong police's recent legal action against Jimmy Lai Chee-ying, widely known as one of the ""black hands"" behind Hong Kong's months-long unrest, and several others in accordance with the law.
In a statement issued on Saturday night, the commissioner's office in reply expressed strong disapproval and firm opposition, making it clear that the United States is pointing fingers at the HKSAR government's law-based governance on the pretext of human rights and freedom, which is a blatant interference in Hong Kong affairs and in the HKSAR's rule of law and judicial independence.
""Hong Kong is a city governed by the rule of law. No one is above the law, and all individuals should take legal responsibility for their actions,"" the statement said.
Some American politicians have openly glorified Jimmy Lai Chee-ying and his ilk -- who have long been engaging in anti-China and trouble-making activities in Hong Kong -- as ""advocates for civil liberties and democracy"" while acting as the judge and firing accusations at the Hong Kong police who have taken the action against the suspects in strict accordance with the law, it said.
The statement emphasized that China is firmly committed to safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests, and to opposing any external interference in Hong Kong affairs.
The statement again urged the U.S. side to immediately stop condoning anti-China suspects who have tried to mess up Hong Kong, stop undermining the rule of law and judicial independence in the HKSAR, and stop meddling with Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs as a whole. Otherwise, the Chinese people, including the Hong Kong compatriots, will definitely fight back.

HONG KONG, Oct. 16 -- The principal official of the Liaison Office of the Chinese Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) on Wednesday firmly opposed and strongly condemned the U.S. House of Representatives' passing of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019.
""The U.S. Congress and a handful of politicians are turning a blind eye to the severe and violent crimes that had happened in Hong Kong, disregarding facts and calling black white,"" the principal official of the liaison office said in a statement.
They are glorifying the reckless acts of arson, store vandalism and violently assaulting police officers as issues concerning human rights and democracy, maliciously defamed the China's central government and the HKSAR government, the official said.
The passage of the Hong Kong-related act is obviously intended to support the extremists and radicals in Hong Kong and is a blatant interference in the Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs as a whole, the official added.
""If the same extreme and violent acts happen in the United States, what would the U.S. government and police do?"" the official asked.
Some U.S. politicians are pointing fingers at the Hong Kong affairs, which exposes their double standard given their handlings of violence in history, shows their extreme hypocrisy on human rights and democracy issues, and lays bare their evil intention to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and contain China's development, the official said.
The principal official reiterated that the implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" principle in Hong Kong since Hong Kong's return to the motherland was a widely recognized success, adding, ""A prosperous and stable Hong Kong is in the common interests of the international community, including the United States.""
The move by the U.S. House of Representatives not only hurt the feelings of the 1.4 billion Chinese people including Hong Kong compatriots, but will also seriously damage the interests of U.S. enterprises, individuals and chamber of commerce that have invested substantially in Hong Kong, just like lifting a rock only to drop it on their own feet, the official said.
No one should underestimate the will and determination of the Chinese government and people to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, uphold the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and implement the ""one country, two systems"" principle, the official stressed.
""U.S. politicians should immediately take back their 'black hands' meddling in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs as a whole, and stop their tricks to move forward the Hong Kong-related act,"" the official warned, saying any attempt to bring chaos to China and damage the ""one country, two systems"" is doomed to fail.

HONG KONG, Aug. 17 -- Starting from June, Hong Kong's opposition and some radical forces have used the pretext of peaceful demonstration to engage in violent protests.
Though the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government said, on many occasions, that it has completely halted the amendments of two ordinances concerning the transfer of fugitive offenders, protesters continued to escalate violence and cause mayhem in Hong Kong.
Here is a timeline of these violent activities that are aimed to trample the rule of law, sabotage social order, undermine national sovereignty and the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
CHALLENGING GOVERNANCE AUTHORITY
The demonstrations, which started in June, repeatedly became violent clashes under the instigation of individuals with ulterior motives. Some radicals repeatedly mounted attacks on police. They surrounded Hong Kong police headquarters, disrupted government agencies and ransacked the Legislative Council (LegCo) building.
-- On June 9, demonstrators started to protest against the proposed amendments. In the wee hours of June 10, well-organized radical protesters started attacking the LegCo building, blocking roads and assaulting police officers. They clashed with police, with some attempting to rob officers of their guns. Eight policemen were injured.
-- On June 12, an illegal rally started around Admiralty, and some radical members stayed around the LegCo building until midnight. Well-organized protesters assaulted officers with bricks, home-made spears and even petrol bombs, injuring 22 police officers. Though police exercised restraint, the protesters continually assaulted their line of defense and forced police to use appropriate force to disperse demonstrators.
-- On June 21, even after the HKSAR government announced that it had halted the amendments, violence continued. Extremist protesters surrounded police headquarters and wreaked havoc, and blocked the public from using service at the Revenue Tower and the Immigration Tower. Then they blocked Hong Kong government offices and the High Court.
-- On June 26, a few 'fanatics' instigated demonstrators to storm police headquarters for the second time. They repeated similar savage behaviors. Opposition lawmakers were once again present to provide support. The personal data of some police officers was illegally leaked online.
-- On July 1, rioters blocked roads and threw corrosive liquids at police officers. They ransacked the LegCo building and assailed police with toxic chemical powder. They extensively damaged the council chamber, defaced HKSAR regional emblem, tore up the Basic Law, waved a colonial-era flag and even called for an establishment of a so-called ""interim government.""

DISTURBING SOCIAL ORDER
Hong Kong's social disorder worsened in July, as aggressive members unlawfully assembled or launched more demonstrations in various districts of Hong Kong. Violence spread further, affecting the normal lives of more residents.
-- On July 6, disputes broke out in Tuen Mun district between protesters and residents. Residents were besieged, beaten and kicked by radicals. Protesters occupied roads and sieged Tuen Mun police station.
-- On July 7, protesters organized another demonstration in Kowloon, leading to a 50-percent plunge in passengers through West Kowloon high-speed train station, compared with an average weekend. Only 31,000 passengers traveled through the station on that day. After the demonstration, some radical protesters illegally blocked roads in Tsim Sha Tsui, forcing most shops to close early in the once trendy shopping area.
-- On July 13, a demonstration in Sheung Shui district ended with violent clashes with the police. A few radical protesters dismantled iron bars, blocked main roads, beat and attacked police officers with umbrellas, iron bars, suspected toxic powders and corrosive liquids. At least 16 police officers were injured. At night, the radical members continued to sabotage stores in the district. The police then launched a clearance operation in accordance with the law.
-- On July 14, some radical protesters removed the roadside fence in Sha Tin district to block roads, sharpened bamboo branches as weapons, hurled bricks, umbrellas and other debris at police officers from high buildings. Fierce clashes broke out at New Town Plaza, injuring at least 10 police officers. An officer in plain clothes was attacked by a mob. Some officers were left with facial fractures. One police officer's finger was bitten off.
-- On July 27, though the Hong Kong police had issued a notice of objection, some people assembled illegally at the Yuen Long district. A group of radical protesters illegally cut off traffic, sieged police vehicles, smashed car windows and smeared cars with insulting words. Police officers were deployed at the village entrances to prevent conflicts between protesters and villagers. Several radical protesters also sieged the Yuen Long police station, forcing the report room to suspend service. Opposition lawmakers were once again present to support the violent acts.
-- On July 28, a number of radical protesters carried out illegal demonstrations in the central and western parts of Hong Kong Island, seriously hindering traffic. They dug up pavement bricks, destroyed street signs and lampposts, set fires on multiple roads and charged police lines. Violence again escalated, as some people carried lethal weapons such as bows and arrows and petrol bombs.

UNDERMINING ""ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS"" PRINCIPLE
A group of extreme radicals stormed the offices of the Central Government in Hong Kong, insulted the national emblem and flag of China, undermined national sovereignty and dignity and the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
-- On July 21, radical protesters besieged and attacked the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government, defaced the national emblem in front of the building by hurling eggs and black paintballs, damaged security facilities and scrawled graffiti insulting the nation.
They even raved about forming an ""interim legislature"" in a statement read out on the scene.
-- On July 28 and Aug. 4, some radical protesters mounted more attacks at the liaison office but were thwarted by riot police.
-- On Aug. 3 and on Aug. 5, black-clad and masked extreme radicals twice ripped the Chinese national flag off the pole in Tsim Sha Tsui, flung it into the sea, in clear defiance of national sovereignty.

PUSHING HONG KONG TO BRINK
Violence and chaos escalated in August as mobsters used guerrilla tactics to stage strikes, block public transport, prevent residents from going to work, damage public facilities, siege police stations and attack police officers across Hong Kong, pushing the city to the brink.
-- On Aug. 3, radical protesters sabotaged areas in Yau Ma Tei, Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok. They blocked the Cross-Harbor Tunnel twice, paralyzing traffic between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. They charged police stations in Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok and Wong Tai Sin, scribbled words to insult and provocate the police, ruined police vehicles and started fires in front of police stations.
-- On Aug. 4, protesters caused considerable damage in western Hong Kong Island, Causeway Bay and Tseung Kwan O by blocking roads and storming several police stations. They later flocked to Hung Hom to block the Cross-Harbor Tunnel and the Golden Bauhinia Square to smear the sculpture.

Around 8:00 p.m. local time on Aug. 13, they unlawfully detained a resident from Shenzhen surnamed Xu, who held a Hong Kong and Macao travel permit for private visit purposes and was at the airport to see people off. They tied him up, shot a laser at his eyes and beat him into a coma. They also obstructed the way for an ambulance crew to take him to hospital. With the help of the police, it took nearly four hours for Xu to be rescued. As the events played out, they also sieged and assaulted a police officer and snatched his baton.
After midnight of Aug. 14, some violent radicals tied up both hands of a Global Times reporter surnamed Fu and beat him in the name of suspecting him to be a fake reporter, causing multiple injuries to Fu.

The radical protesters have become better-equipped, coordinated and planned, and they have continued to push the level of violence to new heights. Alarmingly, many weapon depots containing explosives, firebombs and knives suspected to be owned by radical protesters have been uncovered in police operations.
From June 9 to Aug. 6, the Hong Kong police arrested 589 people suspected of illegal assembly, rioting and assaulting the police.
What is more alarming is that anti-China forces in the West have colluded with local anti-China forces who intend to mess up Hong Kong. On multiple occasions, foreign nationals were seen meeting and talking with radical protesters. Recently, leaders of ""Hong Kong independence"" groups secretly met with officials of the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong. The day after their meeting, the groups said on social media that they plan to boycott classes in September.
It is incontrovertibly evident and without question that the Hong Kong opposition camp and radical groups have colluded with foreign forces. Certain forces in the U.S. and Britain have deliberately ignored extreme violence in the illegal protests and attempted to beautify mobsters as campaigners of ""freedom, democracy and human rights.""
During the recent riots, the Hong Kong Police Force has honored their duties and enforced the law with professionalism and great restraint. The Hong Kong police have been a pillar in safeguarding Hong Kong's social security and the last shield to uphold its social stability. It has maintained its reputation as one of the world's most outstanding police forces. From June 9 to Aug. 5, 139 officers suffered injuries on duty.
Looking back at what happened during the past two months, the ordinance amendment issues have changed in their essence and now bear the features of a ""color revolution.""
Should violence and chaos be allowed to continue, the safety of Hong Kong citizens' lives and property will be endangered, and the governance authority of the SAR government, the cornerstone of the rule of law in Hong Kong, its prosperity and stability, and the ""one country, two systems"" will be destroyed. Citizens of Hong Kong will not allow this to happen. The people of China will not allow this to happen.
On Aug. 7, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong jointly held a symposium in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong Province, briefing the attendees on the central authorities' policies on stabilizing Hong Kong's situation. It stressed that the most pressing and overriding task in Hong Kong is to stop violence, end the chaos and restore order.
The recent violence in Hong Kong is intolerable in any civilized, rational society under the rule of law. Any illegal and criminal acts that blatantly defy the basic principle of ""one country, two systems,"" trample the rule of law, destroy social stability and infringe public interest will be brought to justice.
   A violent radical vandalizes the regional emblem of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after breaking and entering the Legislative Council building in Hong Kong, south China, July 1, 2019. (Xinhua) HONG KONG, Aug. 17 -- Starting from June, Hong Kong's opposition and some radical forces have used the pretext of peaceful demonstration to engage in violent protests. Though the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government said, on many occasions, that it has completely halted the amendments of two ordinances concerning the transfer of fugitive offenders, protesters continued to escalate violence and cause mayhem in Hong Kong. Here is a timeline of these violent activities that are aimed to trample the rule of law, sabotage social order, undermine national sovereignty and the ""one country, two systems"" principle. CHALLENGING GOVERNANCE AUTHORITY The demonstrations, which started in June, repeatedly became violent clashes under the instigation of individuals with ulterior motives. Some radicals repeatedly mounted attacks on police. They surrounded Hong Kong police headquarters, disrupted government agencies and ransacked the Legislative Council (LegCo) building. -- On June 9, demonstrators started to protest against the proposed amendments. In the wee hours of June 10, well-organized radical protesters started attacking the LegCo building, blocking roads and assaulting police officers. They clashed with police, with some attempting to rob officers of their guns. Eight policemen were injured. -- On June 12, an illegal rally started around Admiralty, and some radical members stayed around the LegCo building until midnight. Well-organized protesters assaulted officers with bricks, home-made spears and even petrol bombs, injuring 22 police officers. Though police exercised restraint, the protesters continually assaulted their line of defense and forced police to use appropriate force to disperse demonstrators. -- On June 21, even after the HKSAR government announced that it had halted the amendments, violence continued. Extremist protesters surrounded police headquarters and wreaked havoc, and blocked the public from using service at the Revenue Tower and the Immigration Tower. Then they blocked Hong Kong government offices and the High Court. -- On June 26, a few 'fanatics' instigated demonstrators to storm police headquarters for the second time. They repeated similar savage behaviors. Opposition lawmakers were once again present to provide support. The personal data of some police officers was illegally leaked online. -- On July 1, rioters blocked roads and threw corrosive liquids at police officers. They ransacked the LegCo building and assailed police with toxic chemical powder. They extensively damaged the council chamber, defaced HKSAR regional emblem, tore up the Basic Law, waved a colonial-era flag and even called for an establishment of a so-called ""interim government.""  Violent radicals attempt to break and enter the Legislative Council building in Hong Kong, south China, July 1, 2019. (Xinhua) DISTURBING SOCIAL ORDER Hong Kong's social disorder worsened in July, as aggressive members unlawfully assembled or launched more demonstrations in various districts of Hong Kong. Violence spread further, affecting the normal lives of more residents. -- On July 6, disputes broke out in Tuen Mun district between protesters and residents. Residents were besieged, beaten and kicked by radicals. Protesters occupied roads and sieged Tuen Mun police station. -- On July 7, protesters organized another demonstration in Kowloon, leading to a 50-percent plunge in passengers through West Kowloon high-speed train station, compared with an average weekend. Only 31,000 passengers traveled through the station on that day. After the demonstration, some radical protesters illegally blocked roads in Tsim Sha Tsui, forcing most shops to close early in the once trendy shopping area. -- On July 13, a demonstration in Sheung Shui district ended with violent clashes with the police. A few radical protesters dismantled iron bars, blocked main roads, beat and attacked police officers with umbrellas, iron bars, suspected toxic powders and corrosive liquids. At least 16 police officers were injured. At night, the radical members continued to sabotage stores in the district. The police then launched a clearance operation in accordance with the law. -- On July 14, some radical protesters removed the roadside fence in Sha Tin district to block roads, sharpened bamboo branches as weapons, hurled bricks, umbrellas and other debris at police officers from high buildings. Fierce clashes broke out at New Town Plaza, injuring at least 10 police officers. An officer in plain clothes was attacked by a mob. Some officers were left with facial fractures. One police officer's finger was bitten off. -- On July 27, though the Hong Kong police had issued a notice of objection, some people assembled illegally at the Yuen Long district. A group of radical protesters illegally cut off traffic, sieged police vehicles, smashed car windows and smeared cars with insulting words. Police officers were deployed at the village entrances to prevent conflicts between protesters and villagers. Several radical protesters also sieged the Yuen Long police station, forcing the report room to suspend service. Opposition lawmakers were once again present to support the violent acts. -- On July 28, a number of radical protesters carried out illegal demonstrations in the central and western parts of Hong Kong Island, seriously hindering traffic. They dug up pavement bricks, destroyed street signs and lampposts, set fires on multiple roads and charged police lines. Violence again escalated, as some people carried lethal weapons such as bows and arrows and petrol bombs.

(Xinhua) UNDERMINING ""ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS"" PRINCIPLE A group of extreme radicals stormed the offices of the Central Government in Hong Kong, insulted the national emblem and flag of China, undermined national sovereignty and dignity and the ""one country, two systems"" principle. -- On July 21, radical protesters besieged and attacked the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government, defaced the national emblem in front of the building by hurling eggs and black paintballs, damaged security facilities and scrawled graffiti insulting the nation. They even raved about forming an ""interim legislature"" in a statement read out on the scene. -- On July 28 and Aug. 4, some radical protesters mounted more attacks at the liaison office but were thwarted by riot police. -- On Aug. 3 and on Aug. 5, black-clad and masked extreme radicals twice ripped the Chinese national flag off the pole in Tsim Sha Tsui, flung it into the sea, in clear defiance of national sovereignty. On July 26, police arrested a suspect on suspicion of desecrating the national emblem.  Violent radicals set fires after blocking a road in Causeway Bay, south China's Hong Kong, Aug. 4, 2019. (Xinhua) PUSHING HONG KONG TO BRINK Violence and chaos escalated in August as mobsters used guerrilla tactics to stage strikes, block public transport, prevent residents from going to work, damage public facilities, siege police stations and attack police officers across Hong Kong, pushing the city to the brink. -- On Aug. 3, radical protesters sabotaged areas in Yau Ma Tei, Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok. They blocked the Cross-Harbor Tunnel twice, paralyzing traffic between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. They charged police stations in Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok and Wong Tai Sin, scribbled words to insult and provocate the police, ruined police vehicles and started fires in front of police stations. -- On Aug. 4, protesters caused considerable damage in western Hong Kong Island, Causeway Bay and Tseung Kwan O by blocking roads and storming several police stations. They later flocked to Hung Hom to block the Cross-Harbor Tunnel and the Golden Bauhinia Square to smear the sculpture.  Violent radicals go after a police vehicle in North Point, south China's Hong Hong, Aug. 5, 2019. (Xinhua) -- On Aug. 5, flash mobs stirred up trouble across Hong Kong. They destroyed public facilities, including roadside railings, sidewalk bricks, traffic bollards and lights. As a result, 36 roads and the Cross-Harbor Tunnel were blocked, 96 buses suspended or rerouted, 8 MTR lines obstructed and more than 200 flights canceled. From the night of Aug. 5 to the wee hours of the following day, some radical protesters raided at least 10 police stations. They scribbled words to insult police, hurled petrol bombs and firebombs at police stations and officers, shot vision-harming lasers, ruined police cars, and caused mayhem on several streets, police stations and buildings. They also cut off power lines. -- On Aug. 11, protesters threw petrol bombs and wounded at least one policeman. -- On the evening of Aug. 13 and early on Aug. 14, shockingly violent acts occurred at the Hong Kong International Airport.

HONG KONG, Aug. 8 -- A group of Hong Kong residents gathered on Thursday morning at a pier of the Victoria Harbor to express their reverence to the Chinese national emblem and flag.
To the music of ""Ode to the Motherland,"" they unfurled several Chinese national flags and waved banners that read ""safeguarding the national dignity.""
Later, they sang the national anthem of China in unison, drawing attention and acclaim from a large crowd of passers-by in a luxury shopping district in Tsim Sha Tsui of the Kowloon Peninsula.
""As Chinese, we were all saddened by recent acts of insulting the national emblem and flag,"" said the organizer of the gathering, who only gave his surname Lim. ""We won't allow anyone to tarnish our national image.""
Over the past several days, radical protesters twice removed the Chinese national flags from the flagpole at the pier and flung the flags into the water.
""A national flag represents the dignity of a country. These insulting acts drew an outpouring of anger from all Chinese,"" said an elderly participant named Hsui Kit Fan.
During a demonstration in July, some radical protesters besieged the building of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and defaced the national emblem.
""We were all furious over the recent incidents of insulting our national emblem and flag. These kinds of acts should never be tolerated,"" said another participant surnamed Wong.

""The perpetrators must face severe punishment. This is the only way to prevent the situation from getting worse,"" said the statement.
Over the past two months, protests in Hong Kong have escalated into a spate of violent incidents, threatening social order and endangering public safety.

BEIJING, Aug. 5 -- A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Monday once again urged the U.S. side to stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, stressing that no one should underestimate China's firm resolve to implement the ""one country, two systems"" principle and safeguard prosperity and stability in Hong Kong.
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying made the comments when responded to a letter from some U.S. lawmakers Friday, in which they urged the U.S. government not to help the ""repression"" of Hong Kong's ""peaceful demonstrations"" and rejected the idea of defining those demonstrations as ""riots.""
""The relevant U.S. individuals are calling black white with ill intentions. We firmly oppose that,"" said Hua.
Hua said the violent radicals in Hong Kong smashed their way into the Legislative Building and the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) with iron sticks. They wantonly vandalized public facilities, obstructed public traffic and illegally stored dangerous goods and offensive weapons. They attacked the police in lethal means, beat them and even bit their fingers off. They tarnished the national emblem and national flag.
Those scenes have been witnessed by people around the world. How on earth do those individuals in the United States call them ""peaceful demonstrations""? Hua asked.
""All people with conscience will agree those violent behaviors have already crossed the bottom line of any civilized society. They have crossed the line of peaceful demonstration and freedom of expression. They have gravely trampled on Hong Kong's rule of law, threatened local people's safety and property and violated the bottom line of 'one country, two systems' principle,"" said Hua. ""Such things simply cannot be tolerated.""
She said the U.S. side doesn't mention at all and has turned a blind eye to the power abuse and violent law enforcement of police at home. But at the same time, it blatantly criticized or even tried to smear the professional, civilized and constrained law enforcement of Hong Kong police. ""This will only help the world see how arrogant, biased, hypocritical, ruthless, selfish and bossy the U.S. side is.""
Is rampant violence and collapse of rule of law something the U.S. side calls ""human rights and freedom""? Hua asked.
Hua also urged the U.S. side to stop conniving at violent criminals, and undermining the administering by the government of the HKSAR in accordance with law and interfering in Hong Kong affairs.

Hua expressed her doubts on Engel's comments and said he has ""turned white to black"" and ""confused right and wrong.""
 
""How can some Americans use the words 'peaceful protests' when seeing violent protesters storm the Legislative Council Complex and besiege the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, not to mention the organized assault on police by lethal weapons?"" Hua asked.
 
She recalled a resolution passed by the European Parliament earlier this year which stressed that demonstrations and freedom of expression, which are not without limits, must be exercised within the law and subject to police enforcement restrictions.
 
Hua also said during the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011, the New York authorities intensified police by gathering policemen from eight cities, deploying explosion-proof vehicle, riot squads, snipers and horse teams and using weapons such as electric batons and taser guns.
 
Saying the U.S. police have repeatedly mentioned force must be used when there is any threat to the lives of the officers, Hua wonders if officers in Washington D.C. and New York were assaulted in the same way as those in the HKSAR, what the U.S. police would do.
 
She reiterated that the central government firmly supports the HKSAR government in exercising effective governance and the police there in punishing lawless and violent acts in accordance with the law, so as to safeguard long-term stability, development and prosperity of the city.
 
All people with a sense of justice and all citizens who truly love Hong Kong should make joint efforts for Hong Kong's long-term peace and stability, Hua added.

During a press conference on Wednesday at the Chinese Embassy in Britain, Liu expounded China's firm position over the recent violent act of storming the Legislative Council Complex in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, stressing that China is strongly dissatisfied with and firmly opposes Britain's gross interference in Hong Kong affairs and domestic affairs of China.
He told over 40 correspondents from 25 media outlets that the British government chose to stand on the wrong side. It has made inappropriate remarks not only to interfere in affairs of Hong Kong, but also to back up the violent law-breakers, the ambassador said.
""What's more, the British side has attempted to interfere in Hong Kong's rule of law and obstruct Hong Kong authorities from bringing the criminals to justice,"" Liu added.
Liu stressed that Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China, not under the British colonial rule, and Hong Kong affairs are absolutely China's internal affairs, which by no means tolerate the interference by any countries, groups and individuals.
China has unwavering determination in safeguarding its sovereignty, security and interests in development and maintaining prosperity and stability in Hong Kong, Liu said, reiterating China's firm opposition to interference by external forces.
The incident in Hong Kong was covered by massive reports worldwide, especially by British media. However, some of the reports are extremely biased and some are even malicious, he added.

The Act confuses right and wrong in total disregard of the facts, brazenly bolsters up violent radicals in Hong Kong and grossly interferes in China's internal affairs, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said in a statement released Thursday morning.
Since the return of Hong Kong to the motherland in 1997, policies including ""one country, two systems,"" ""Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong"" and a high degree of autonomy have been earnestly carried out, and Hong Kong residents' rights and freedom have been fully guaranteed, Geng said.
But in the past three months, the situation in Hong Kong, initially from the fallout over revisions to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, has gone completely awry as radical forces and violent activists wantonly disturbed public order, destroyed public facilities and assaulted and injured police officers with the support and indulgence of external forces and the anti-China disruptors in Hong Kong.
""All these acts went far beyond normal peaceful demonstrations and assemblies, trampled on social morality, violated the baseline of the rule of law and challenged the bottom line of the 'one country, two systems' principle,"" said Geng in the statement.
He said it has become a broad consensus for all walks of life in Hong Kong to stop the violence and restore order.
The central government of China firmly supports the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the Hong Kong police and the HKSAR judiciary in carrying out their duties in accordance with the law, said the spokesperson.
Geng said the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs persisted in reviewing and approving the Hong Kong-related act in disregard of the appeals of all sectors of Hong Kong society and basic norms of international relations, wantonly backing radical forces and violent activists in Hong Kong.
""Such a move constitutes gross interference in China's internal affairs and fully exposes some U.S. Congress members' vicious intention to send Hong Kong into chaos and contain China's development,"" he said.
Geng said it is in line with the interests of all parties including the United States that Hong Kong maintains prosperity and stability as there are more than 80,000 U.S. citizens living in Hong Kong together with over 1,300 U.S. companies and considerable U.S. investment.
""The approval of the act by U.S. congressional committees can only embolden radicals and violent activists to further destabilize Hong Kong, which will jeopardize the interests of both China and the United States,"" Geng said.
He warned that no one should underestimate China's determination to safeguard its national sovereignty, safety and development interests, implement the ""one country, two systems"" policy and safeguard Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
""Any U.S. move that undermines China's interests will be met with our vigorous response,"" Geng said.
China strongly urges some U.S. Congress members to correctly understand the situation, immediately stop pushing the review of the Hong Kong-related act and stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and interfering in China's internal affairs to avoid further damage to China-U.S. relations, said the spokesperson.

HONG KONG, Aug. 20 -- The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government will start work immediately on building a platform for dialogue among all walks of life, the HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam said Tuesday.
While meeting the press, Lam said she hopes all sides can show understanding and respect toward each other, and conduct dialogues in an open and direct manner with people of all classes with different political stances and backgrounds in a bid to find a way out for Hong Kong.
Lam said she and the heads of the government bureaus are willing to go directly to communities and talk with people.
On the economic situation in Hong Kong, Lam said the economic figures for the first half of the year did not fully reflect the severity of the downside risks.
A raft of measures with total government spending of 19.1 billion Hong Kong dollars (2.43 billion U.S. dollars) have been rolled out to support growth and relieve the burden on businesses and individuals.
If necessary, the HKSAR government will adopt more such measures to support the economy before the release of the policy address or the government budget, Lam said.
Lam pledged that the HKSAR government will keep monitoring the economic situation, make necessary preparations and propose effective measures.
The HKSAR government will act more boldly to deal with deep-seated problems and both high-level and grassroots officials will give priority to the need of residents when proposing specific measures, Lam said.
During the past two years, the HKSAR government has taken effective measures in its policy address in areas such as housing, land and education to advance the economy and improve people's livelihood, Lam said.
Lam also responded positively to the new policy support for Shenzhen by the central government.
China will build the southern city into a pilot demonstration area of socialism with Chinese characteristics, according to a document issued recently by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council.
The city's development toward a pilot demonstration area will also be a boon to the complementary cooperation between Shenzhen and hong Kong, Lam said.
Of all cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the relationship between Hong Kong and Shenzhen is the closest, she said.
""The two are very good partners,"" Lam said, adding that the two have built a high-level cooperative mechanism and are jointly developing a technological and innovation park.
Lam also said the Independent Police Complaints Council is working on an independent investigation into the causes and facts of the recent confrontations and violence, adding that a report will be submitted to her in six months and will also be available to the public.
""I hope that this is a very responsible response to the aspirations (of public) for better understanding of what has been taking place in Hong Kong,"" she added.

At a press conference at his office, Leung said the violent incidents at the Hong Kong International Airport during the past two days were unacceptable and broke the law.
Anyone who willfully commits violent acts at an international airport that endangers, or likely to, the safety of the airport or of other people, whether by any device, substance or weapon or otherwise, faces a sentence up to imprisonment for life, according to the Aviation Security Ordinance of Hong Kong.
Leung called on young people who had been misled into blocking the airport to return to reason and understand the criminal consequences, and the public to put pressure on the radicals so that they will not dare to commit violence acts. He also urged people from industrial and commercial sectors to stand out and voice their opinions.
The violence at the airport does not represent Hong Kong, Leung said, adding that the majority of Hong Kong people are peaceful, rational and law-abiding. ""Hong Kong people welcome compatriots from the mainland to visit Hong Kong more for tourism, sightseeing, study and work.""
Leung proposed a reward fund to encourage residents to provide clues and help the police capture radicals who insulted the country, attacked the police and disrupted social order.

A symposium is jointly held by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong Province, Aug. 7, 2019. (Xinhua/Jin Liangkuai)
Hong Kong is facing the most severe situation since its return to the motherland, said Zhang Xiaoming, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, at a symposium jointly held by the office and the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
""The most pressing and overriding task at present is to stop violence, end the chaos and restore order, so as to safeguard our homeland and prevent Hong Kong from sinking into an abyss,"" Zhang said.
More than 550 people attended the meeting, including HKSAR deputies to the National People's Congress, national and provincial political advisors from HKSAR, leaders of patriotic political and social organizations in Hong Kong, as well as those from relevant youth, education and professional organizations and mainland enterprises operating in Hong Kong.
At the symposium, Zhang briefed the attendees on the central authorities' policies on stabilizing Hong Kong's situation while Wang Zhimin, director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in HKSAR, proposed how to implement the policies.
If the violence and chaos are allowed to continue, not only the safety of Hong Kong citizens' lives and property will be endangered, the governance authority of the SAR government, the cornerstone of the rule of law in Hong Kong, the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, and the ""one country, two systems"" will also be destroyed, Zhang said.
""Citizens of Hong Kong will not allow this to happen. The people of China will not allow this to happen,"" Zhang said.
He said the central authorities will never sit by if the situation in Hong Kong worsens to a turmoil that the SAR government can not control.
""According to the Basic Law (of the HKSAR), the central authorities have ample methods as well as sufficient strength to promptly settle any possible turmoil should it occur,"" he said.
As many people in Hong Kong have pointed out, the ordinance amendment issues have changed in their essence, and now bear the features of a ""color revolution,"" Zhang said.
The criminal activities that blatantly challenged the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle must be punished by law, Zhang said, noting that plotters, organizers and directors behind the scenes must be held for criminal responsibility.
Zhang stressed support for the chief executive and police of the HKSAR, calling it the key to stabilizing the situation in Hong Kong.
Zhang said the central authorities firmly support Chief Executive Carrie Lam in leading the HKSAR government's law-based governance, voicing confidence in Lam's wisdom and ability to handle the current situation in Hong Kong and lead the HKSAR government's administrative team to move forward and make further progress.
He also reiterated the central authorities' unswerving support for the Hong Kong police.
The chaos in Hong Kong cannot be allowed to continue, said Zhang, adding that this is the common aspiration of the vast majority of Hong Kong residents, including many who have kept silent.
""The turnaround in the Hong Kong situation will not come from retreat or compromise with the opposition,"" Zhang said. ""People can give up on the idea that the central authorities will make any concessions on issues concerning our principles.""
Zhang called on people who love China and Hong Kong to play their pivotal role in maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
Wang said that Zhang's message is the ""authoritative voice"" people have been expecting to hear for quite some time.
""It is now a 'life-or-death' fight for the very future of Hong Kong,"" Wang said. ""There is no room for retreat.""
The most pressing and strongest appeal to all sectors in Hong Kong society, Wang said, is to stop the violence and end the chaos, which is also the broadest consensus.
He said the primary need at this time of emergency is to unswervingly work with the HKSAR chief executive and the HKSAR government to crush the opposition's rumors and dispel their illusions.

""It is now a 'life-or-death' fight for the very future of Hong Kong,"" Wang said. ""There is no room for retreat."" The most pressing and strongest appeal to all sectors in Hong Kong society, Wang said, is to stop the violence and end the chaos, which is also the broadest consensus. He said the primary need at this time of emergency is to unswervingly work with the HKSAR chief executive and the HKSAR government to crush the opposition's rumors and dispel their illusions."	CCTV

They strongly condemned the act as a flagrant trampling on the national dignity and the principle of ""one country, two systems,"" calling on the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) to hold the perpetrators accountable.

Leung Chun-ying, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, issued three posts on the social media to express his ""strongest condemnation"" of the act.
He also offered a reward of 1 million Hong Kong dollars (about 128,000 U.S. dollars) for those who offer useful information leading to the capture of whoever committed the crime.
Chan Man Ki, founding president of the Small and Medium Law Firms Association of Hong Kong, also expressed her strongest condemnation of the act, saying that it is punishable for fines and a jail term of three years according to relevant Hong Kong regulations.

The 57-year-old man suffered more than 40 percent burns and is under close medical supervision in the intensive care unit.
Police have classified the case as attempted murder, a charge which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. They are also appealing for any witnesses to come forward and provide information on the incident.
The spokesman also said that a protester who was shot with live ammunition in the Sai Wan Ho area on Monday morning had his medical condition downgraded from critical to serious on Tuesday. A traffic police officer, who shot and wounded the black-clad rioter during a scuffle, had acted in ""a split second"" to protect his life, as well as those of others, when the protester tried to snatch his gun, according to Hong Kong police.
Hong Kong was plunged into citywide chaos for a second straight day, amid violent actions by radical protesters in multiple districts calling for a ""general strike"". Like the day before, they disrupted the morning commute by blocking subway lines, setting up barricades and scattering nails on roads to block private cars and buses.
Service on four major subway lines that transport commuters into Hong Kong Island from Kowloon and the New Territories had either been suspended or delayed, subway operator MTR Corp said on its website.
A train on the East Rail Line was forced to stop in the middle of operation after obstacles were found on the tracks. The commuters had to walk on the rail track to get back to the nearby Sha Tin station.
Public buses had to cease operations in the middle of roads after being trashed and painted with graffiti on windshields. About 30 buses were forced to park along Nathan Road at Mong Kok as their tires were punctured by protesters.
Radicals also threw bricks and other hard objects from high places, such as overpasses, onto roads where cars and pedestrians were passing through, forcing police to fire tear gas to disperse them. At least one man was taken to hospital with head injuries after being hit by an object thrown from a footbridge over Pok Fu Lam Road near the University of Hong Kong.
At least six universities announced the suspension of classes on Wednesday.
More than 100 black-clad protesters barricaded a road near the Chinese University of Hong Kong and confronted police. They then challenged the police cordon, despite mediation by university staff members. Multiple fires were seen on campus, including a burned-out car in the middle of the road. Police fired several rounds of tear gas and arrested three protesters.
In the morning, a group of people broke into a storehouse in a sports stadium at CUHK and took away bows, arrows and javelins with metallic arrowheads. The equipment that was known to have been taken was retrieved, according to a statement from the university.
Another group of protesters gathered on a footbridge leading to City University of Hong Kong and threw bricks and other objects onto the streets. Police dispersed the area with tear gas.
It is legitimate for the police to take action on campus in accordance with the law, in bid to prevent any areas in the city becoming shelters for lawbreakers, a police spokesman said on Tuesday.
More than 60 percent of the 287 people arrested on Monday were students, according to the police.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, at a regular press briefing before the Executive Council meets, condemned the radicals' action of paralyzing traffic as ""extremely selfish"". Their intention was to force a citywide shutdown, Lam said.
Lam conveyed her respect for Hong Kong people who kept going to work and school despite the adverse traffic situation. She also expressed gratitude to the people of Hong Kong who voluntarily cleaned up the debris on roads, saying they ""injected positive energy"" into the chaos experienced by the city.
A group of the city's pro-establishment legislators on Tuesday made their strongest condemnation against rioters' brutal, widespread violence.
Meeting members of the media as radicals vandalized the city's Central business district, the lawmakers also urged the government to establish an intergovernmental task force to end the rampant violence that has been haunting the city for more than five months.
The group called on everyone in the community to stop embellishing violence that has ""lost rationality and humanity"" and to support the government in law-enforcement actions to restore the city's law and order.
In a statement issued on Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Commissioner's Office of the Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region said that the brutal action of black-clad rioters in Hong Kong is ""no different from terrorism"".

In a statement, the embassy said that Simon Cheng had been legally detained and his rights had been observed.
Cheng, who said he had been gathering information on the Hong Kong protests as part of his job, was held after visiting the mainland in August. He says that he was accused of soliciting a prostitute, but refused in a BBC interview to address the issue, claiming that would play into the Chinese authorities' hands. 
While in detention, he says that he was beaten and subjected to other ill-treatment while being questioned about the activists behind the protests against Chinese influence and policies.
In a tweet the Chinese Embassy said: ""Simon Cheng was placed under a 15-day administrative detention by police in Shenzhen last August for violating the Public Security Administration Punishments Law of P. R. China. He confessed all his offences. All his lawful rights & interests were guaranteed in accordance with law.""
Cheng, a Hong Kong resident, made his claims on a Facebook post and in an interview with the BBC. 
He said he was forced to make a written confession and told that if he spoke about his experiences he would be spirited out of Hong Kong back to mainland.
""I won't give up the fight for human rights, peace, freedom and democracy for the rest of my life, no matter the danger, discrimination and retaliation I will face, and no matter how my reputation will be stained, and no matter whether my future would be blacklisted, labelled, and ruined,"" Cheng said.
Britain's Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Cheng's account was credible and that the treatment amounted to torture. He raised the issue directly with China's ambassador Liu Xiaoming. 
The statement from China's embassy said that during the meeting, in addition to denying Cheng's accusations, Liu Xiaoming criticized Britain's involvement in condoning the violent acts of protesters in Hong Kong who have attacked police with petrol bombs, rocks and arrows. He urged the government in London to stop interfering in China's internal affairs. 
Hong Kong, which the UK handed back to China in 1997, enjoys relative autonomy under ""One Country, Two Systems"" but has been wracked by protests against Beijing's influence since June. 
Questioned about Cheng's case at a press conference, Hong Kong's justice secretary Teresa Cheng urged him to report the incident to the correct authorities and said she would look into the matter if it were raised with her.

At least 25 people have died in almost two weeks of demonstrations and violence after Modi's government passed a law criticized as anti-Muslim. More protests took place on Sunday.  What did Modi say? Leading a rally for his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in New Delhi on Sunday, Modi said Muslims ""don't need to worry at all"" provided they are genuine Indians. ""Muslims who are sons of the soil and whose ancestors are the children of mother India need not to worry,"" Modi told the crowd of thousands. ""The law does not impact 1.3 billion Indians, and I must assure Muslim citizens of India that this law will not change anything for them,"" said Modi, adding that his government introduces reforms without any religious bias. He went on to accuse the main opposition Congress party of condoning the violence over the Citizen Amendment Act by not condemning it. Why is an NRC controversial? Modi insisted there had been ""no discussion"" about a nationwide ""register of citizens,"" which many Muslims in India fear is targeted mainly at them. Home Minister Amit Shah has said repeatedly that such an exercise will take place aimed at removing all ""infiltrators"" from India. The ruling party also promised in their 2019 national election manifesto to implement a National Register of Citizens (NRC) in a ""phased manner in other parts of the country."" This year such a register in Assam state left off 1.9 million people unable to prove they or their forebears were there before 1971. They now face possible statelessness. What's the background? The Citizenship Amendment Act gives religious minority members – Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis, Christians and Buddhists – from three neighboring Islamic countries an easier path to citizenship, but not if they are Muslim. Islamic groups, the opposition and others at home and abroad fear this forms part of Modi's aim to marginalize India's 200 million Muslims and remold the country as a Hindu nation. Demonstrations against the citizenship law have been largely peaceful but protesters have also hurled rocks and torched vehicles, while police tactics have fueled anger. Tens of thousands of protesters gathered late Saturday in the southern city of Hyderabad. Other large demonstrations took place on Sunday, including in Jaipur and Mumbai. In Bangalore, other protesters gathered to support the law. How has the government responded? Modi's party plans to hold more than 200 news conferences to counter the protests as anger grows over what critics say is an attack on the country's secular constitution. Authorities have imposed emergency laws and blocked internet access across the country in an attempt to contain the unrest. More than 7,500 people have either been detained under emergency laws or arrested for rioting, according to state officials. The state's government has said it will confiscate and auction properties of those involved in arson and destruction of public properties to recover damages. New Delhi's state election early next year will be the first major electoral test for Modi's BJP in the wake of the mass demonstrations."	CCTV

After two months of demonstrations in Baghdad and the southern provinces, the protesters' demands have risen to a comprehensive change of the political process.
Abdul Aziz al-Jubouri, a professor of Media College in Iraqiya University in Baghdad, told Xinhua that Abdul Mahdi's resignation came after the Shiite cleric Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani withdrew the religious leadership's support when he called on the parliament to reconsider the government.
""Al-Sistani's call, which was widely welcomed by the leading political parties, pushed Abdul Mahdi to declare his resignation before being dismissed by the parliament and also to give a signal to the protesters that he is stepping down to meet their demands,"" al-Jubouri said.
However, the resignation will give momentum to the demonstrators as a sign of success and will also prompt them to increase their demands to include prosecution of prominent figures of the current political process, and new facts will be imposed on the ground that any future government must be accepted by the protesters, al-Jubouri added.
During his period in office, Abdul Mahdi was often caught in the middle of rising tensions between the United States and Iran, with many believing that his government and many of its important officials were being close to Tehran, according to al-Jubouri.
""The protesters were widely rejecting the Iranian influence in Iraq, and in many cases there were rallies in Baghdad and other southern provinces chanting anti-Iran slogans,"" he said.
Accordingly, the relations between Iraq and Iran would be affected by demonstrations because the anti-Iran feelings have been on rise recently, al-Jubouri added.
""Any upcoming government will be under pressure by the demonstrators to avoid foreign interference in Iraq's internal affairs, nevertheless, the Iranian and U.S. influence will still have a saying in forming any new government, despite their reducing influence,"" he concluded.
For his part, Nadhum Ali, an expert of the Arab Forum for Iranian Researches, told Xinhua that Abdul Mahdi's resignation could open the door for larger problem, which is changing the whole post-2003 political process in Iraq.
During the year that Abdul Mahdi spent in office, he was apparently blamed of being closer to Iran, in contrary to his government program that he announced when he took over his post, which said that he would seek balanced relations regionally and internationally.
Ali believes that Abdul Mahdi's resignation is like ""putting the ball in the court of the political parties that nominated him a year ago. And once again there's going to be a lot of tough and long negotiations among the political parties that can paralyze the state and could slide the already shaky country into chaos and civil war.""
The protests are likely to continue until the parliament passes a new elections law and a new electoral commission to hold the early elections, but it will take a long time to meet these constitutional measures, according to Ali.
Abdul Mahdi's resignation came more than a year after he was sworn in as Iraqi prime minister in October 2018.
According to the Iraqi constitution, the largest coalition in parliament should nominate a candidate for the vacant post to President Barham Salih who will task the new prime minister-designate to form a new cabinet.
The prime minister-designate has 30 days to form a cabinet and present it to parliament for approval. The parliament must approve each minister in separate absolute majority votes.

The BJP conceded defeat in the eastern state of Jharkhand, with an alliance of the main opposition Congress party and a regional bloc slated to take control of the resource-rich province.
""I dedicate this victory to the people of Jharkhand,"" Hemant Soren, leader of the regional Jharkhand Mukti Morcha party, said after claiming victory.
The loss comes in the middle of a sometimes deadly wave of nationwide protests triggered by a new citizenship law, which critics say discriminates against Muslims and has brought thousands of people out on to the streets in opposition.
The polls in Jharkhand opened on November 30, before the demonstrations kicked off and do not represent the current public mood. However, the BJP's defeat will be a shot in the arm for India's opposition parties, some of which have used popular anger against the Citizenship Amendment Act to their advantage.
The Modi government insists that the law is needed to help persecuted non-Muslim minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who came to India before 2015 by giving them Indian citizenship.
And in a show of strength on Monday, the BJP staged a protest, attended by several hundred people, in Kolkata in support of the CAA.
""Today, we have seen that Bengal stands with Modi ji and it welcomes the Citizenship Amendment Act,"" said Jagat Prakash Nadda, the BJP's national working president, using an honorific for the prime minister.
But groups opposed to the law gathered in the southern cities of Bangalore and Chennai, the capital New Delhi and north eastern Assam state, in the latest demonstrations against the CAA and the Modi government's proposal to conduct a nationwide National Register of Citizens.
In Assam, protests have been held since December 10, initially turning violent but largely peaceful over the past week.
Assam's finance minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, told reporters that since December 10, 393 people have been arrested for arson, violence and looting and 10 for ""inflammatory"" social media posts.

The Modi government insists that the law is needed to help persecuted non-Muslim minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who came to India before 2015 by giving them Indian citizenship. And in a show of strength on Monday, the BJP staged a protest, attended by several hundred people, in Kolkata in support of the CAA. ""Today, we have seen that Bengal stands with Modi ji and it welcomes the Citizenship Amendment Act,"" said Jagat Prakash Nadda, the BJP's national working president, using an honorific for the prime minister. But groups opposed to the law gathered in the southern cities of Bangalore and Chennai, the capital New Delhi and north eastern Assam state, in the latest demonstrations against the CAA and the Modi government's proposal to conduct a nationwide National Register of Citizens. In Assam, protests have been held since December 10, initially turning violent but largely peaceful over the past week. Assam's finance minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, told reporters that since December 10, 393 people have been arrested for arson, violence and looting and 10 for ""inflammatory"" social media posts."

Speaking at a news briefing and legislative inquiry, three officials from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government called on the whole of society to support the government and say ""no"" to violence.
No one can use their political ideals or dissatisfaction with the government as an excuse to blatantly break the law, Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said at the Legislative Council inquiry on Wednesday.
The recent violence in Hong Kong has been severe and widespread, and it would not be acceptable in any civilized society, Cheung said. The violence has blocked people's way to work and school, deprived them of their freedom of movement and posed a serious threat to the whole community, he said.
""Violence is pushing Hong Kong toward the abyss,"" he added.
Cheung reiterated that the government will firmly support the police in quelling violence, and called on the public to stay away from illegal assemblies.
For the third straight day, protesters disrupted traffic across Hong Kong. Service along two rail lines was forced to shut down completely and a dozen stations were closed.
Only 100 of the 650 franchised bus routes could offer limited service on Wednesday, said Secretary for Transport and Housing Frank Chan Fan.
Chan condemned Tuesday's attacks on several MTR stations. Radicals severely threatened passenger safety as they threw gasoline bombs at moving trains and scattered debris on rail tracks. About 200 traffic lights were also damaged and in need of repair, he added.
A group of locals voluntarily cleared bricks and debris from roads in Yuen Long on Wednesday morning. Traffic in the area has been severely disrupted, with railway tracks damaged and roads blocked by debris and bricks from Tuesday's clashes.
Classes suspended
The Education Bureau announced a full-day suspension of school on Thursday due to safety concerns.
The chaotic traffic and dangerous road conditions have made it very difficult for students to attend classes, a bureau spokesperson said in a statement.
Schools had even received threats to suspend classes for various periods. Some school buses were damaged after principals refused to comply, Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung said.
The Chinese University of Hong Kong announced on Wednesday afternoon an abrupt end to the current semester, with all remaining classes canceled, after a full day of violent confrontation adjacent to its Sha Tin campus. The university arranged for students to leave campus by bus.
Following CUHK's decision, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology said that classes will be conducted online starting next week until the end of the current term, given the escalation of unrest.
Hong Kong Baptist University announced a similar online learning arrangement at the same time in view of potential disruptions to campus services due to the ongoing civil unrest.
The Commissioner's Office of the Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region expressed firm opposition on Wednesday to false and misleading reports about Hong Kong by some Western media outlets.
A spokesperson for the office said in a statement that those reports accused police of stopping violence with ""excessive use of force"" and whitewashed rioters' crime of setting an innocent citizen afire and their attempts to snatch guns from police officers.
The spokesperson said that selective reports and comments by some Western media outlets in Hong Kong have grossly distorted the truth.
The spokesperson urged those Western media sources to immediately stop distorting the truth and pouring fuel on the fire in Hong Kong. Otherwise, they would only be condemned by all fair-minded people, including 1.4 billion Chinese.

Hundreds of thousands of Indians have taken to the streets in recent days to voice their anger over a new citizenship law they say discriminates against the minority Muslim community.
The law enacted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government provides non-Muslim minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who moved to India before 2015 a pathway to Indian citizenship.
It's not just Muslims who are protesting, instead, majority Hindus and Parsis are joining in to condemn the legislation across the country of 1.3 billion people.
Some of these protests have led to clashes between the police and demonstrators in, which at least 21 people have been killed.
Many Indians say the law violates India's secular constitution by making religion a test for citizenship. They say the law and a proposed national register of citizens could be used against the Muslim minority.
The government approved 87.54 billion rupees (1.23 billion U.S. dollars) for conducting the census and 39.41 billion rupees for updating the National Population Register (NPR), said Prakash Javadekar, Information and Broadcasting Minister.
The census collects data on population, economy activity, social and cultural aspects, migration and demography, down to the lowest administrative level.
The NPR is intended to create a comprehensive identity database of every resident of India.
The census and population survey will start from April next year.

HONG KONG, Aug. 13 -- Protesters created chaos at the Hong Kong International Airport for the second day on Tuesday, causing cancellations of most outbound flights at one of the busiest airports in the world.
All check-in services for departure flights were suspended starting at 4:30 p.m., the Airport Authority Hong Kong said in a statement after protesters occupied the airport terminal and prevented passengers from departing.
Footage aired by a local broadcaster showed some protesters grab passengers' arms, preventing them from passing through checkpoints.
As of 3 p.m., 188 arriving and 182 departing flights scheduled on Tuesday had been canceled due to the protests, according to the airport authority.
It was the second day of chaos at the airport caused by protests, leaving many stranded passengers visibly annoyed.
""Unfortunately with the chaos, we are stuck here in the airport,"" said a Filipino passenger named Bennet. ""No food and no drinks at all. Most of the restaurants are closed.""
A passenger from the Chinese mainland said she considered flying from Shenzhen instead. ""I don't know when this will end,"" she said.
""They (protesters) are damaging Hong Kong's business environment and image,"" said the passenger surnamed Gao. ""I love Hong Kong, but I feel sorry for those young people who have been incited and used.""
A HEAVY PRICE
Frank Chan Fan, secretary for transport and housing of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government, said paralyzing the airport will make Hong Kong ""pay a heavy price.""
""Amid fierce regional competition, it is very easy to destroy years of achievements the airport has accomplished, but rebuilding them would be very hard,"" Chan said.
In 2018, the Hong Kong airport handled an average of 200,000 travelers each day, while trade via air accounted for nearly half of Hong Kong's total trade volume.
In a joint statement on Tuesday, seven labor unions in the aviation industry of Hong Kong condemned the unpermitted demonstrations that have stained the international reputation of Hong Kong.

On Tuesday, HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the most urgent task now is to stop violence and safeguard the rule of law to prevent Hong Kong from sinking into ""an abyss where it will be smashed to pieces.""
Lam said some people, in the name of freedom or justice, have been committing vandalism and damaging the rule of law, throwing Hong Kong into a state of panic.

If violence persists, it will take a long time to restore the openness, freedom, inclusiveness and economic stability in Hong Kong, and the stable lives of seven million residents can not continue, Lam said.
RETAIL, TOURISM BADLY HIT
Weeks of protests and violent incidents have dented Hong Kong's retail, catering and tourism sectors, a key part of the local economy.
Business owners and industry insiders expressed growing worries as endless and ever-escalating violence continued to weigh on consumption and deter potential tourists.
""Business has been really bad recently. Sometimes, we don't receive a single guest in hours,"" said Ben Pui, a lobby manager of a hotel located in Sai Wan on Hong Kong Island.
The occupancy rate for Pui's hotel is currently struggling to reach 70 percent, compared with over 90 percent in past summers, despite a drop of room price to 300 HK dollars (38.2 U.S. dollars) from 600.
Visitor arrivals to Hong Kong totaled around 5.14 million in June, dropping by about 770,000 from the figure in May, according to Hong Kong Tourism Board.
Since June, the tourism sector has been hit hard by multiple violent protests, and safety concerns mounted, said Yiu Si-wing, a lawmaker and tourism industry insider, adding that immediate recovery is not likely even if violence ceases soon.
The HKSAR government said earlier this month that the value of total retail sales in June 2019 decreased by 6.7 percent compared with the same month in 2018, as local consumer sentiment turned more cautious and growth in visitor arrivals moderated.
""Every time I heard about a possible protest in the neighborhood, I just closed my shop and took a day off,"" said a Hong Kong resident surnamed Lau, who runs a small clothing shop in the Causeway Bay shopping district.
""With the chaos, people don't want to hang out and buy things. How can I make money?"" Lau said.

According to the Article 67(4) of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China on the NPC Standing Committee's power to interpret laws and the Article 158(1) of the Basic Law of the HKSAR that states ""the power of interpretation of this Law shall be vested in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress,"" the NPC Standing Committee reserves the right of final judgement as to whether Hong Kong's local laws contravene the Basic Law, the principal official said.

This power originates from the Chinese Constitution and is contained in the HKSAR Basic Law itself, and is in general and unqualified terms.
As per the decision on handling the laws previously in force in Hong Kong in accordance with Article 160 of the Basic Law of HKSAR, which was made by the NPC Standing Committee on Feb. 23, 1997, the Emergency Regulations Ordinance was adopted as a law of the HKSAR, the principal official said.
The principal official said they are confident that facing the most important and pressing task for Hong Kong at present of bringing violence and chaos to an end and restoring order, all walks of life in Hong Kong will firmly support the chief executive and the HKSAR government in governing in accordance with the law and taking active measures, firmly support the Hong Kong police in strictly enforcing the law, and firmly support the Hong Kong judicial bodies in punishing the violent criminals in accordance with the law.  HONG KONG, Nov. 19 -- The Liaison Office of the Chinese Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said Tuesday that the administrative, legislative and judicial bodies of the HKSAR should respect relevant decisions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) when performing their duties and exercising relevant powers in accordance with the law.

Following Chan's release, Secretary for Security of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) John Lee said that Chan has already indicated willingness to surrender after his case in Hong Kong has been concluded, and the HKSAR government will of course be offering what is possible under (HKSAR) legal system the information that is requested by the Taiwan authorities.
The Hong Kong authorities have been all the while in making efforts to assist the Taiwan authorities in their investigation. ""But everything must be done in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong and under our legal framework,"" Lee stressed.
""One thing which is very important is that the accused person has already indicated his willingness to surrender, and it should be handled quickly without hindrance so that justice is done,"" Lee said, urging Taiwan ""to see how they can accept the accused person surrender, giving the best facilitation, rather than laying all the hurdles and restrictions in regard to his surrender.""
Chan finished his prison term sentenced by a HKSAR court in April 2019 for offenses of money laundering.
He told media outside the prison that he has done things wrong and irreparable, and has thus all along been in self-blame and self-condemnation.
He is hence willing to bear the consequences of the impulsive mistake by surrendering to Taiwan, standing trial and serving sentence, Chan said.
Chan, a Hong Kong resident, killed his pregnant girlfriend during their trip to Taiwan in February 2018 and was arrested by the police in Hong Kong in March 2018. The HKSAR government's Department of Justice, however, found that there was hardly sufficient evidence in Hong Kong to prosecute him for offenses other than money laundering.
The HKSAR government proposed earlier this year amendments to two HKSAR ordinances concerning fugitive offenders transfers and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters to deal with the case in Taiwan, which has no agreement on the surrender of fugitive offenders with Hong Kong.
The HKSAR government announced last week that the HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam received a letter from Chan in which he expressed the decision to surrender and requested the HKSAR government to assist him in making relevant arrangement.
The HKSAR government has reiterated that it hopes Taiwan will receive the self-surrendered suspect and it will offer all necessary assistance within its legal limits. Chan Tong-kai, the suspect of a homicide case in Taiwan, was released on Wednesday morning from a prison in Hong Kong, saying he is willing to surrender to Taiwan.  Following Chan's release, Secretary for Security of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) John Lee said that Chan has already indicated willingness to surrender after his case in Hong Kong has been concluded, and the HKSAR government will of course be offering what is possible under (HKSAR) legal system the information that is requested by the Taiwan authorities. The Hong Kong authorities have been all the while in making efforts to assist the Taiwan authorities in their investigation.

In response to the deteriorating situation of recent protests, the spokesman said in a statement that ""blatant violation of law, wanton destruction of public peace and violent attacks on the Police will harm Hong Kong's society, economy and our people's livelihood.""
The spokesman said that recent protests which were organized in the name of expressing demands have intensified illegal and road-blocking acts.
""Protesters maliciously committed serious unlawful acts including making violent attacks in different districts, assaulting police officers and committing arson. Protesters further blocked both ways of the tunnel tubes of Hong Hom Cross Harbour Tunnel as well as major trunk roads such as Lung Cheung Road yesterday and early this morning, causing serious adverse impacts on the public,"" he said.
As for some protesters who are instigating the public to participate in strikes and blocking roads and public transport on Monday, the HKSAR government hoped that while expressing their demands, protesters should abide by the law and respect the rights of other members of the public, the spokesman said.
The HKSAR government also calls on the general public to ""stand fast at their posts and cherish Hong Kong's hard-earned international financial centre status, stable economic base and a diverse and inclusive social environment.""
Hong Kong's economy is suffering from both external headwinds and local social issues. The latest economic data, which is the worst over the past decade, shows that the economy is weakening and the risk of an economic downturn is increasing, according to the spokesman.
""Any large-scale strikes and acts of violence will affect the livelihood and economic activities of Hong Kong citizens. This will only undermine further the local economy that is facing downside risks, as well as the confidence of the international community and overseas investors in Hong Kong's society and economy, causing loss and damages to law and order, economy, people's livelihood, employment and eventually to the detriment of all quarters of society,"" the spokesman added.
The HKSAR government reiterated that the entire civil service has to stay united amid all the pressure and challenges.
""This is a difficult moment and government colleagues must act in the overall interest of Hong Kong and work together to uphold the core values of the civil service,"" said the spokesman.

It has exposed the hypocrisy of the self-styled advocate of press freedom, a statement said.
BEIJING, March 18 -- China on Wednesday announced countermeasures against restrictive measures on Chinese media agencies in the United States, according to an official statement.
The statement said that in recent years, the U.S. government has placed unwarranted restrictions on Chinese media agencies and personnel in the United States, purposely made things difficult for their normal reporting assignments, and subjected them to growing discrimination and politically motivated oppression.
In December 2018, the United States ordered certain Chinese media organizations in the United States to register as ""foreign agents."" In February 2020, it designated five Chinese media entities in the United States as ""foreign missions"" and imposed a cap on the number of their employees, in effect expelling Chinese journalists from the United States.
Such outrageous treatment prompted strong representations from China. China firmly objected to and strongly condemned the U.S. move, and stressed its reserved right to respond and take actions, said the statement.
The statement said that China hereby announces the following measures, effective immediately:
First, in response to the U.S. designation of five Chinese media agencies as ""foreign missions"", China demands, in the spirit of reciprocity, that the China-based branches of Voice of America, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post and Time declare in written form information about their staff, finance, operation and real estate in China.
Second, in response to the United States slashing the staff size of Chinese media outlets in the United States, which is expulsion in all but name, China demands that journalists of U.S. citizenship working with the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post whose press credentials are due to expire before the end of 2020 notify the Department of Information of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs within four calendar days starting from Wednesday and hand back their press cards within 10 calendar days. They will not be allowed to continue working as journalists in the People's Republic of China, including its Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions.
Third, in response to the discriminatory restrictions the United States has imposed on Chinese journalists with regard to visa, administrative review and reporting, China will take reciprocal measures against American journalists.
The statement said that the above-mentioned measures are entirely necessary and reciprocal countermeasures that China is compelled to take in response to the unreasonable oppression the Chinese media organizations experience in the United States. They are legitimate and justified self-defense in every sense.
The U.S. moves exclusively targeting Chinese media organizations were driven by a Cold War mentality and ideological bias. It has seriously tarnished the reputation and image of Chinese media organizations, seriously affected their normal operation in the United States, and seriously disrupted people-to-people and cultural exchanges between the two countries. It has therefore exposed the hypocrisy of the self-styled advocate of press freedom, the statement said.
""China urges the United States to immediately change course, undo the damage, and stop its political oppression and arbitrary restrictions on Chinese media organizations. Should the United States choose to go further down the wrong path, it could expect more countermeasures from China,"" the statement read.
The statement said that China's fundamental state policy of opening up has not changed and will not change. ""Foreign media organizations and journalists who cover stories in accordance with laws and regulations are always welcome in China, and will get continued assistance from our side.""
""What we reject is ideological bias against China, fake news made in the name of press freedom, and breaches of ethics in journalism.

GUANGZHOU, March 12 -- Renowned Chinese respiratory specialist Zhong Nanshan said Thursday that if most countries act like China, attaching national-level importance to response efforts, the global COVID-19 pandemic could be brought under control ""by June.""
Zhong made the remarks at a press conference in Guangzhou on Thursday.
""I know that some countries have done a good job and some countries have not. Some countries have reminded people to be wary of the virus and not to treat it as flu. Our estimate of global control by June was based on the positive measures taken by those countries, but if the world fails to attach great importance to addressing the threat and infectiousness of the virus through interventions, this timeframe may be extended,"" Zhong said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a ""pandemic"" as the virus continues to spread worldwide while urging the international community to take urgent and aggressive action to contain the pandemic.
Zhong said the WHO has declared the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic, which demands more measures to be taken by relevant countries. Zhong called on all countries to respond to the initiative of the WHO and take interventions at the national level.
Currently, the fatality rate in Italy is about 6 percent, and that in France and Spain is about 2 percent to 3 percent, whereas the average fatality rate in China is reported as 3 percent. The fatality rate in Wuhan and Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak, is above 4 percent, but the rate in other provinces outside Hubei is very low, as very effective prevention and control measures have been taken, according to Zhong.
China's experience can help the world avoid detours in their fight against the COVID-19 outbreak and the mortality rate of the current COVID-19 outbreak overseas is similar to the early stages in Wuhan, Zhong added.
Zhong said his team has exchanged ideas on the epidemic prevention and control with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Japan, Singapore, and a number of European countries, and Chinese experts have been sent to Italy to facilitate further communication.
It is essential to enhance the exchanges between China and overseas regions since China's experience and lessons over the past two months can help the world reduce both the prevalence and mortality rates, Zhong said.
China on Thursday said the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country is over, hours after the WHO declared the epidemic outbreak as a pandemic.
New cases keep declining and the overall epidemic situation remains at a low level in China. The number of new confirmed cases in Wuhan has dropped to single digits, with only eight cases reported on Wednesday. No new cases had been reported in other cities of Hubei for a week in a row, according to the National Health Commission.
However, there are now more than 118,000 confirmed cases in 114 countries and regions, and 4,291 people have lost their lives. The number of coronavirus cases, deaths and affected countries is expected to climb even higher in the days and weeks ahead, according to the WHO.
China has basically contained the coronavirus spread as a number of provincial-level regions have reported no new cases for days, but the new risks largely come from imported cases, said Zhong.
By the end of Wednesday, 85 imported cases had been reported, according to the National Health Commission.
Minimizing the risks of imported COVID-19 cases has become a priority in China's epidemic control and prevention efforts, Zhong added.
Imported cases often arrived in China with some symptoms, but not necessarily a fever, so more efforts should be made on monitoring the cases, said Zhong, suggesting that nucleic acid tests should be used for emergency cases.

Such violence has seriously trampled on the rule of law in Hong Kong, undermined its stability, and has been widely condemned by the international community. However, some Western countries including the United States and the United Kingdom, instead of condemning the violence, have called for ensuring the “right of local residents to peaceful protest.” This naked double standard of dealing with violence is a gross interference in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs. The Chinese side has lodged strong protests.  The rule of law is the most important foundation of Hong Kong. In February this year, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government initiated the revision of extradition law amendments regarding fugitive offenders. The purpose was to plug the loopholes in the existing legal system and to prevent Hong Kong from becoming a safe haven for criminals. In Hong Kong, there have been expressions of different opinions in this regard. After the protesters took part in street demonstrations and even riots, the SAR Government decided to suspend the amendments in order to listen more widely to the views of the various aspects of society and jointly advance the rule of law. However, some extremists did not stop here because their goal was not only to oppose the amendments, but to use this as an excuse to cause chaos in Hong Kong and achieve their ulterior political goals. They deliberately chose to block public roads on July 1st, the day of Hong Kong's return to the motherland, attacking the local police, and assaulting the important symbol of Hong Kong's rule of law - the Legislative Council building. Their violence has far exceeded the bottom line of peaceful expression of demands, threatened Hong Kong’s public order, and seriously trampled on the rule of law in Hong Kong. They have openly challenged the ""one country, two systems"" bottom line. No sovereign country can tolerate this, and will surely hold them responsible in accordance with the law. However, some Western countries, which have always advocated a high degree of rule of law, have been “tolerant” this time, claiming to guarantee the right of violent offenders to peaceful protest. Did they forget that when violent crimes occurred in these countries, local police in anti-riot vehicles used weapons and other gear to arrest protesters on a large scale? For example, in 2014, after a black young man in Ferguson, Missouri, was shot fatally by the police, a large-scale protest and riots occurred in the area. The heavily armed American police threw tear gas at demonstrators and fired rubber bullets. The scene of riots was likened by the US media to a ""war zone"". Now, when the rioters in Hong Kong hit the Legislative Council building in broad daylight, why did some Western forces suffer from selective blindness and openly support the criminals? This double standard approach violates the basic norms of international law and international relations, undermining China’s sovereignty and security. It has made people more aware that external forces are merely speaking in the name of freedom and human rights, and colluding with the Hong Kong opposition figures, in an attempt to seize the power of governing Hong Kong and undermine the practice of ""one country, two systems"" and thus deter China's development. From the illegal “Occupy Central” protests in 2014, to the riots in Mong Kok in 2017, and to the turmoil caused by proposed amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, the sinister intentions of external forces interfering in China's internal affairs and throwing China into disarray have never been dead. Hong Kong residents who have weathered the storms will never allow Hong Kong to fall into disorder. As the first stop of the ""one country, two systems"" practice, Hong Kong has been at the forefront of the growth of the developed economies in the world. It has successfully resisted the Asian financial crisis and the global financial crisis, and has been selected by many international organizations as one of the freest economies and the most competitive regions. Hong Kong's GDP increased from 1.37 trillion Hong Kong dollars in 1997 to 2.84 trillion Hong Kong dollars in 2018; Hong Kong's per capita GDP increased from 210,000 Hong Kong dollars in 1997 to 381,900 Hong Kong dollars in 2018. The establishment of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area has helped create new opportunities for Hong Kong's economic development. In this regard, some Hong Kong media have commented that ""one country, two systems"" is the biggest advantage of Hong Kong's development as the principle allows Hong Kong to share the dividends of national development and protect the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents. Regarding the intervention of external forces, the Chinese government's attitude is clear and firm: Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs, and no country, external organization or individual has the right to intervene. If such obsessive wrong-headedness continues, China will inevitably respond further. Don't underestimate China's firm determination to safeguard its national sovereignty. Any attempt to interfere in Hong Kong affairs and throw China into disorder will never succeed."	CCTV

July 1 is a day of great festivity for people from all walks of life in Hong Kong to commemorate the return of Hong Kong to the motherland and the establishment of the HKSAR, the spokesperson said.
Some ultra-radicals, however, under the excuse of opposing the HKSAR government amending related ordinances, stormed the LegCo complex in an extremely violent manner and wantonly damaged facilities there, the spokesperson said.
Seriously violating the law, the act tramples the rule of law in Hong Kong, undermines social order and the fundamental interests of Hong Kong, and is a blatant challenge to the bottom line of ""one country, two systems,"" the spokesperson said. ""We strongly condemn this act.""
The central government resolutely supports the HKSAR government and police in implementing their duties in accordance with the law, and supports the HKSAR's related authorities in holding the violent offenders criminally accountable in accordance with the law, so as to restore the normal social order at an early date, guarantee residents' personal and property safety, and safeguard the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, the spokesperson said.
HK CE condemns 'extreme use of violence' and vows to follow up
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor strongly condemned the extreme use of violence and vandalism by masked protesters who stormed into the city's legislature on Monday night.
She vowed to follow up the violent acts as they have undermined the city's long-cherished value of the rule of law, one of Hong Kong's cornerstones.
Meeting with the press at the early hours of Tuesday after the police had dispersed protesters, Lam said the violent and chaotic scenes have saddened and shocked a lot of people.
""This is something that we should seriously condemn because nothing is more important than the rule of law in Hong Kong,"" Lam said.
Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu said those protesters have violated an array of serious offenses in the Public Order Ordinance, Crimes Ordinance and the Legislative Council (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance.
Forcing their way into the LegCo is punishable up to two years under the Public Order Ordinance, Lee said.
Also condemning the act is the Commissioner of Police Lo Wai-chung, who said the protesters ignored repeated warnings by the police and resorted to violence.
The violent and radical behavior of protesters drew criticism from various sectors of the local community, who expressed strong condemnation for trashing one of the city's symbols of the rule of law.
Hundreds of radical protesters smashed glass walls of the LegCo Complex with wire mesh trolleys and metal poles on Monday afternoon. Metal fencing of the building was also dismantled.
The clashes escalated at night as masked protesters, demanding a withdrawal of the extradition law amendment bill which had been suspended on June 15, broke into the LegCo Complex at around 9 pm. They tore pictures of LegCo presidents off the wall, tarnished the wall by painting profane language, and damaged facilities such as chairs and glass cabinets.
Protesters also besmirched the Hong Kong SAR emblem in the chamber by spraying it with oil paint.
Thousands of others occupied Harcourt Road outside the LegCo Complex, passing umbrellas and metal barricades into the complex.
The Hong Kong Police Force slammed the ""illegal and violent"" acts for posing serious threats to public safety and public order in a statement.
The police started to disperse the crowds around midnight.
In a statement issued Monday afternoon, the SAR government said it ""strongly condemns and deeply regrets"" the extremely violent acts committed by these protesters.
""Hong Kong is a society that respects the rule of law, and has never tolerated violence,"" the statement read.
LegCo President Andrew Leung Kwan­yuen decried the violence against the legislature in two messages relayed via his spokesperson. Leung said he is ""deeply saddened and deeply regrets"" such violent behavior.
Forty­two lawmakers, including Starry Lee Wai­king and Regina Ip Lau Suk­yee, issued a joint statement criticizing the ""extremely radical and violent protesters"" for seriously disrupting public order and stability. They called on society to show zero tolerance toward such acts.
Barrister Ronny Tong Ka­wah said that the protesters who conducted such violent acts are, at least, guilty of rioting, criminal damage and harm with intent.
The acts were not about expressing opinions but challenging authority, said Tong, who is also a member of the Executive Council, the top policy advisory body to Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet­ngor. No rationale can legitimize their violent acts, Tong stressed.
Stanley Ng Chau­pei, a Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress, said he was shocked by the illegal acts of some protesters, and added that they were ""complete rioters"".
What they did violated the rule of law — a core value that the SAR has adhered to — and posed a threat to the safety of police officers, LegCo members, and themselves, Ng said.
Violence is never an option for expressing views. The violent acts were nothing but an attempt to overthrow the SAR government, Ng said.
On the same day, a large number of demonstrators took to the street to march against the government's extradition bill, which was relatively peaceful.

Qin said China strongly urges the U.S. side to immediately correct its mistakes, abandon double standards on anti-terrorism issues, prevent the bill from becoming law and stop interfering in China's internal affairs by using Xinjiang-related issues.
""China will respond further according to the development of the situation,"" said Qin.
He said Xinjiang is a part of China, and Xinjiang-related affairs are purely China's internal affairs, which brook no foreign interference.
Qin said China's counter-terrorism and deradicalization measures in Xinjiang according to the law were distorted as human rights violations in the so-called ""Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019.""
The move of the U.S. side disregarded facts, reversed right and wrong, violated conscience and practiced double standards on counter-terrorism issues, he said, noting the U.S. actions seriously violated international law and basic principles of international relations, and grossly interfered in China's internal affairs.
Qin said China's determination to defend national sovereignty, security and development interests is unwavering. Any attempt to sour China's ethnic relations, undermine Xinjiang's prosperity and stability and contain China's development is doomed to fail.

Mohammad Faisal, a spokesman for Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Hong Kong affairs are completely China's internal affairs, and Pakistan understands the actions taken by the Chinese central government and the HKSAR government to uphold national sovereignty and maintain the city's prosperity and stability.
Helen Sham-Ho, a former Australian politician, said the current chaotic situation in Hong Kong is damaging its prosperity, adding that there is no doubt that the priority is to regain order and police have the right to uphold law and order.
Michael Borchmann, a law expert and former government official from Germany, said that the purpose of the ongoing protests in Hong Kong is to stir up chaos and turmoil in the city, and is not a response to the draft extradition bill, Nouvelles d'Europe cited him as saying.
Borchmann said it is true that freedom of speech and freedom of assembly are protected by law in Hong Kong, but this doesn't give people the right to use violence to impose on the freedoms of others. Criticism of China by some voices in the Western media was irrelevant, he added.
In reference to the recent attacks on Hong Kong police and the blockade of Hong Kong International Airport by some radical demonstrators, Abdulaziz Alshaabani, a Saudi Arabian expert on Chinese affairs, said such radical acts seriously undermined the rule of law, hindered economic development and harmed the interests of Hong Kong's people.
If the violence further escalates, Hong Kong's prosperity and stability will suffer a severe blow, undermining its well-deserved international image and status, the Saudi expert said.
Wilson Lee Flores, a columnist at The Philippine Star, said the continued chaos in Hong Kong, apparently created by anti-government protesters and encouraged by foreign influences, must be quickly stopped.
Strong measures should be taken as the chaos is not only bad for Hong Kong's economy and tourism, but also disadvantageous for the prosperity of the East Asian region as Hong Kong is an important financial and trade center, he said.
China's Mission to the European Union said on Wednesday that what is happening in Hong Kong is now devolving into extreme violence.
It said in an online statement that any attempt to lump together the rigorously lawful exercise of duties by Hong Kong police with the extreme and violent offenses by radicals is absolutely misleading and incorrect, and China is firmly opposed to such attempts.
China's diplomatic mission in Geneva also lashed out at the United Nations human rights office on Wednesday, accusing its spokesman of making a ""wrongful statement"" about protests in Hong Kong that ""sends the wrong signal to the violent criminal offenders"".

On Saturday, hundreds of Chinese students and overseas Chinese in the United Kingdom gathered at London's Trafalgar Square to protest the ""independence demonstration"" in Hong Kong. Demonstrators at London's landmark square waved Chinese flags, sang the Chinese national anthem and chanted ""no violence"" and ""one nation, one China"". One said he came to express his support for Hong Kong and its police, and his objection to separatists. The demonstration was organized after overseas students learned that some Hong Kong ""independence"" activists were planning a rally, said an overseas student who declined to be named. ""Many people here cannot see the truth we see. What they see is a purposeful message that is changed by some Western media, and they cannot see what is really happening in Hong Kong,"" he said. Another student said, ""We only have one China. We do not allow and we will not tolerate any forces, or even some Western powers, to split our country."" The demonstrations have spread to Australia, as students in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide have spilled over onto the streets of cities and university campuses calling for an end to violence in Hong Kong. On Saturday, around 3,000 people who were mobilized through social media marched peacefully through the streets of Sydney. Among banners that said ""Protect Hong Kong, fight against violence,"" one of the group's leaders, Tony Jiang, an Australian of Chinese descent, said ""We came here to stand against the violent riots and the decaying law and order in Hong Kong,"" Xinhua News Agency reported. Chen Jingye, China's ambassador to Australia, issued a statement on Saturday calling the Hong Kong protesters' actions ""radical, violent and illegal"" and said they were determined to undermine the ""one country, two systems"" principle.

He said event in Hong Kong was ""solely the internal affair of China"" and warned foreign governments to not support Hong Kong's radical protesters or interfere. In the German cities of Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne, peace lovers spontaneously held rallies to show their solidarity and support for Hong Kong over the weekend.

Two prominent Hong Kong women want to tell the world that the violent protests in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region these past few months have marred the stability and prosperity of the global financial hub.
Pansy Ho Chiu-king, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Federation of Women, said she wants to speak up about the truth in Hong Kong.
Ho and Annie Wu Suk-ching, a founding member of the federation, were scheduled to speak Tuesday afternoon at the 42nd session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland.
Speaking to the media on Monday, Ho said that she spent the past three months feeling puzzled and distressed. The daughter of Hong Kong and Macao-based businessman Stanley Ho, she said many Hong Kong people are afraid to venture outside due to the violence, and businesses－especially small and medium-sized enterprises－have been hit hard.
On July 1, mobs stormed Hong Kong's Legislative Council building, smashing glass doors and vandalizing the interior. On Aug 12 and 13, Hong Kong International Airport was largely shut down as protesters and mobs blocked the departure hall. In other protests, mobs threw gasoline bombs at police and damaged several subway stations.
""We hope to bring back peace and the rule of law to our society,"" Ho said.
She felt puzzled as to why the overseas media never reported on the fear caused by the riots among the ordinary people living in Hong Kong.
Ho expressed that she is not pointing fingers and it is true that there are differences in society that deserve attention.
""But we must try to look for a solution in a peaceful manner and with mutual respect instead of escalation,"" she said.
Ho praised Hong Kong police for their professionalism, saying, ""They did the best they could.""
Wu, also a businesswoman and daughter of James Tak Wu, founder of Maxim's Catering, said that the actions by mobs who damaged Hong Kong's subway system, blocked the airport and damaged public facilities, have sullied the city's global reputation. ""It's dangerous because people think that Hong Kong is no longer safe,"" she said.
In her written remarks presented to the human rights council, Ho said the foundation of Hong Kong's prosperity and stability has been shaken to the core by violent protests over the past two months.
Spreading misinformation across different platforms locally and internationally, instigating disturbances in public places, destroying public and government property, engaging in acts with the intention to cause bodily harm to the police and private citizens, vilifying the police to create public hatred and engaging in unlawful acts to provoke reactions from police are all part of a grand scheme created by the radical protesters to undermine the Hong Kong government's authority to maintain social order, according to the remarks.

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government said on Sunday that it hopes Taiwan will receive the self-surrendered suspect of a homicide case and it will offer all necessary assistance within its legal limits.
The HKSAR government has relayed the surrender decision of Chan Tong-kai, the suspect of a homicide case that happened in Taiwan in 2018, to Taiwan authorities without delay, and conveyed that due to Chan's request, the authority of Hong Kong would assist Chan in relevant arrangement and provide the necessary and legally feasible assistance to Taiwan in this matter, the HKSAR government said in a statement.
The HKSAR government hopes that Taiwan authorities ""will take positive step to receive a self-surrendered person wanted by them in a pragmatic manner. We will offer all necessary assistance within the legal limits of Hong Kong,"" said the statement.
Chan, a Hong Kong resident suspected of killing his girlfriend in Taiwan in February 2018, was sentenced to imprisonment for 29 months in Hong Kong in April 2019 for offenses of money laundering. He is currently serving the sentence.
The HKSAR government announced on Friday that Chan had sent a letter to HKSAR chief executive expressing his decision to surrender himself to Taiwan for his alleged involvement in the homicide case upon prison discharge.
In Sunday's statement, the HKSAR government emphasized that Chan's decision is purely out of his own free will, rejecting allegations that Chan was manipulated to surrender or his decision was out of political maneuvering as ""totally groundless"".
The HKSAR government's Department of Justice has thoroughly and comprehensively considered the police's investigation and the evidence collected, and confirmed that there was only enough evidence to prosecute Chan for money laundering offenses, and not other offenses including attempting to commit murder or the so-called ""willfully plan to commit homicide,"" it said.
""Hong Kong's law enforcement, prosecution and judiciary adhere to the principle of political neutrality, and act strictly in accordance with evidence,"" it said. ""We express the deepest regret for the groundless and fabricated allegations of 'inadequate investigation', 'indifferent attitude towards pursuing the charge of homicide', as well as 'inaction in exercising the jurisdiction of Hong Kong's Courts'.""
The HKSAR government said it has all along clearly stated to Taiwan that the authority of Hong Kong would be pleased to provide the necessary and legally feasible assistance to Taiwan in its investigation on the homicide case.
""Now that Chan has indicated his wish to surrender himself to Taiwan, the judicial proceedings are over and Chan will not lodge any appeal and is about to be discharged from prison, we have conveyed to Taiwan clearly that we will be pleased to provide the necessary and legally feasible assistance to Taiwan. Should Taiwan raise any request for evidence in processing Chan's surrender case, we will positively assist in accordance with our law,"" it said.  The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government said on Sunday that it hopes Taiwan will receive the self-surrendered suspect of a homicide case and it will offer all necessary assistance within its legal limits. The HKSAR government has relayed the surrender decision of Chan Tong-kai, the suspect of a homicide case that happened in Taiwan in 2018, to Taiwan authorities without delay, and conveyed that due to Chan's request, the authority of Hong Kong would assist Chan in relevant arrangement and provide the necessary and legally feasible assistance to Taiwan in this matter, the HKSAR government said in a statement. The HKSAR government hopes that Taiwan authorities ""will take positive step to receive a self-surrendered person wanted by them in a pragmatic manner. We will offer all necessary assistance within the legal limits of Hong Kong,"" said the statement. Chan, a Hong Kong resident suspected of killing his girlfriend in Taiwan in February 2018, was sentenced to imprisonment for 29 months in Hong Kong in April 2019 for offenses of money laundering. He is currently serving the sentence. The HKSAR government announced on Friday that Chan had sent a letter to HKSAR chief executive expressing his decision to surrender himself to Taiwan for his alleged involvement in the homicide case upon prison discharge. In Sunday's statement, the HKSAR government emphasized that Chan's decision is purely out of his own free will, rejecting allegations that Chan was manipulated to surrender or his decision was out of political maneuvering as ""totally groundless"". The HKSAR government's Department of Justice has thoroughly and comprehensively considered the police's investigation and the evidence collected, and confirmed that there was only enough evidence to prosecute Chan for money laundering offenses, and not other offenses including attempting to commit murder or the so-called ""willfully plan to commit homicide,"" it said. ""Hong Kong's law enforcement, prosecution and judiciary adhere to the principle of political neutrality, and act strictly in accordance with evidence,"" it said. ""We express the deepest regret for the groundless and fabricated allegations of 'inadequate investigation', 'indifferent attitude towards pursuing the charge of homicide', as well as 'inaction in exercising the jurisdiction of Hong Kong's Courts'.""

Ali al-Bayati, a member of the Iraqi Independent High Commission for Human Rights (IHCHR), told reporters that the death toll of violence that accompanied the protests during the three days in Baghdad and some provinces rose to 38 people, including two members of the security forces. He said that up to 1,648 people were wounded, including 360 security members, pointing out that most of them have left the hospital after receiving treatment. On Thursday, al-Bayati put the number at 26 killed, including two security members, and 1,509 people were wounded, including 401 security members, according to the figures registered by the IHCHR's watching teams. The IHCHR is an independent commission which is linked to the Iraqi parliament. It was established by UN agencies in Iraq in cooperation with the Iraqi government to promote and protect the rights of all Iraq's people according to international standards. The demonstrations erupted in the capital Baghdad and several provinces across Iraq over unemployment, government corruption and the lack of basic services. The demonstration turned violent in Baghdad as clashes erupted with the police. The protests also spread to other Iraqi provinces when hundreds of protesters attacked and burned several provincial government buildings and offices of leading political parties. On Thursday, sporadic protests continued during the day despite the curfew that was imposed in Baghdad starting from 5:00 a.m. local time (0200 GMT) Thursday morning. The Iraqi Defense Minister Najah al-Shammari said in a statement on Wednesday that he has decided to raise the state of alert for the Iraqi armed forces ""to preserve state sovereignty and protect all foreign embassies and diplomatic missions operating in Iraq.""  "	CCTV

LONDON, June 3 -- U.S. President Donald Trump was greeted with a royal family welcome and protests after he arrived in London on Monday for a three-day state visit.
Protesters were out in force across the capital, mainly outside Buckingham Palace and the heavily fortified U.S. Ambassador's official residence in Regent's Park.
Trump's first-day visit ended with a formal and lavish state banquet in the splendor of Queen Elizabeth's main London home.
The president posted a message on his social media site, saying that the relationship with the United Kingdom is very strong.
""Big Trade Deal is possible once U.K. gets rid of the shackles,"" he said, referring to the post-Brexit U.S.-UK trade agreement.
Hosted by the Queen, the banquet was attended by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall as well as Prince William and his wife, Duchess of Cambridge as well as 11 other Royals, along with prominent Americans living in Britain.
The Queen, in a speech, said state visits served as a reminder of the close and lasting relationship between Britain and the U.S.
Just an hour before the banquet, the British Opposition Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn announced he would be the main speaker at an anti-Trump rally Tuesday in Trafalgar Square.
Corbyn posted a message on his social media site saying: ""Tomorrow's protest against Donald Trump's state visit is an opportunity to stand in solidarity with those he's attacked in America, around the world and in our own country.""
Also declining an invitation to the banquet were the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Leader of the minority Liberal Democrats, Vince Cable.
Organizers of the rally are predicting 250,000 will be on the streets of London Tuesday expressing their opposition to Trump's state visit.
The President and his wife, First Lady Melania Trump, met the Queen and her heir Prince Charles on the West Lawn at the palace, followed by an inspection of Grenadier Guards.
Outside the Buckingham Palace, protesters chanted messages and waved banners.
As Air Force One was making its early morning descent at London Stansted Airport, Trump put out a tweet message that sent London media, as well as diplomats, into a whirl.
Trump made disparaging remarks against one of his British critics, the Labor Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. He described Khan a stone cold loser, adding he thought the London mayor had done a ""terrible job"" as mayor.   Queen Elizabeth II (2nd L), U.S. President Donald Trump (C) and his wife Melania Trump (1st L), Prince Charles (2nd R), and Camilla, attend a welcome ceremony at Buckingham Palace in London, Britain, on June 3, 2019.

BEIJING, March 11 -- Chinese President Xi Jinping's inspection trip to Wuhan on Tuesday has demonstrated his care for people's health and safety and assured the world of China's confidence in the final victory over the novel coronavirus, international experts and scholars have said.
On Tuesday, Xi went to Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in central China and the provincial capital of Hubei, for an inspection of the epidemic prevention and control work in Wuhan and Hubei.
Andrey Ostrovsky, deputy director of the Institute of Far Eastern Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences, said Xi's visit to Wuhan shows a leader's responsibility and demonstrates that he cares about his people.
""The visit is important for the Chinese people, especially in the current conditions, when there is such a test not only for the Chinese people, but also for a number of other countries,"" Ostrovsky said.
Diaa Helmy, secretary-general of Cairo-based Egyptian-Chinese Chamber of Commerce, said that Xi's visit is a message of appreciation to people living in Wuhan during the epidemic.
It also reflects the solidarity among all segments of the Chinese society, from the leaders to the citizens, he said.
Xi's inspection trip to Wuhan has brought support and encouragement from China's top leadership to people in the city, said Yu Hong, a senior research fellow at the East Asian Institute of the National University of Singapore.
Subhomoy Bhattacharjee, a consultant at the Research and Information System for Developing Countries based in India, said the news of Xi's visit to Wuhan has increased the world's optimism about China's development prospects.
The expert said he believes that China, as an economic engine, will gradually mobilize global production capacity.
Wuhan's experience has proved that epidemic containment can be achieved, and that China's experience in combating the epidemic is scientific and effective, which offers inspirations to the whole world, he said.
Iryna Nykorak, chief executive officer of the Silk Road Association of Ukraine, said that as people now live in a globalized world, the novel coronavirus is a common challenge facing all countries.
The Chinese government has taken effective measures to deal with the epidemic, shared its experience and information with other countries, and done as much as possible to prevent the epidemic from spreading to other countries, she noted.

HONG KONG, Aug. 5 -- Hong Kong's transport network was partially paralyzed on Monday as protesters brought fresh chaos.
Metro commuters were seriously affected by protesters, as many lines suspended operations.
At Fortress Hill metro station, protesters repeatedly blocked train car doors, causing the suspension of operation. ""No nonsense. We want to go to work. Leave us alone,"" said a middle-aged commuter, confronting a black-clad radical.
The metro system in Hong Kong transports about 5.8 million passengers a day.
A husband who moved his pregnant wife out of a train car cried out: ""Don't you ever come close to a pregnant woman. Call the ambulance, now!""
Footages aired by local broadcasters also showed motorists angrily accusing radicals of blocking traffic on the city's main avenues.
Flights were canceled at Hong Kong International Airport, one of the busiest airports in the world.
A passenger surnamed Woo said he was unable to fly to Japan as planned.
""It is very selfish for some people to hurt the interests of the vast majority of residents in the name of so-called democracy,"" Woo said.
More Hong Kong residents decided that they would go to work anyway and were not bothered by leaving home one or two hours in advance to avoid traffic disturbances.
""I have a very simple demand today -- that is to go to work no matter what,"" a resident surnamed Lai told local media.
""VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION""
Weeks of protests in Hong Kong escalated into a spate of violent incidents, which saw some radicals assault police officers and commit arson and vandalism, among other serious law violations.
At a press conference, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Carrie Lam warned that extreme violence is pushing Hong Kong to a ""very dangerous situation.""
She urged people to peacefully express their demands and not to destroy the prosperous and stable future of Hong Kong.
Violence would send Hong Kong onto a road with no return, she said.
Lam said radicals' violent expression of demands has come at the expense of others' freedom and rights.
The radicals defaced the Chinese national emblem and flung the national flag into the sea, all these actions have challenged China's sovereignty and undermined the ""one country, two systems"" principle as well as Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, Lam said.
""Hong Kong's future and the lives of its over 7 million people shouldn't be put at stake,"" Lam said, calling for the peaceful expression of demands from Hong Kong residents.
ORDER, ORDER, ORDER
Calls for peace and order were mounting among ordinary Hong Kong residents.
A fruit stand owner surnamed Suen complained that few people came to buy fruits on Monday.
""I hope the situation is temporary and will subside as soon as possible,"" Suen said. ""The government should not give in. The radicals reach out for a yard after taking an inch.""
""Local people hung out less as transport became less convenient, and tourists dare not come to Hong Kong as they are afraid of the social chaos,"" said a pharmacy store owner on Hennessy Road surnamed Ho who wished the radicals would go home and leave ordinary residents alone.
""Otherwise, we are paying the price for what they did,"" she said.
Gary Lee and his wife kept their tiny restaurant open throughout Monday.
""Of course we are worried, but we need to do business. We have got rent to pay,"" said Lee's wife. ""We want our old, normal days back.""

The law, which smacks of ego and arrogance, is backing violent criminals at a time when Hong Kong is in a desperate need to end violence and chaos, and restore order. It is also a blatant example of Washington's long-term hypocrisy and practice of double standard on issues related to human rights.
For quite some time, some politicians in Washington have gotten used to lecturing other countries on human rights while turning a blind eye to the fact that human rights violations in the United States are multiplying.
According to data released last year by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, 1.2 million violent crimes, including more than 130,000 rapes and 17,000 murders, were reported in the United States in 2017. While gun violence has also become an epidemic, interest groups have highly politicized the gun control issue and turned any potential solution into a mission impossible.
The chronic systematic racial discrimination in the United States has also grown worse.
Across America today, more and more African Americans risk dying at the hands of police due to their skin color, ethnic minorities face ever severe judicial discrimination, and the number of racist hate crime cases hit one record after another.
Also, privacy breaches caused by cyber surveillance, as well as inhumane immigration policies that separate parents from their children, have drawn wide criticism from many international institutions.
America's human rights record is not only infamous at home, but also appalling abroad.
For more than a decade, the persistent U.S. overseas military operations have resulted in massive civilian fatalities. Through such means as regime changes, wars, and economic embargoes, the United States has spawned one human rights disaster after another in many parts of the world.
While the U.S. human rights situation is flashing alarm signs, China is making steady progress.
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China 70 years ago, the wellbeing, rights and freedoms enjoyed by the Chinese people have seen remarkable progress and growing global recognition. Since Hong Kong's return to China, the ""one country, two systems"" principle has seen a faithful and full implementation, and the legitimate rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents have been fully guaranteed.
However, some U.S. politicians have chosen to ignore China's substantial human rights progress.
In the eyes of these politicians, the interests of the 1.4 billion Chinese people, including those in Hong Kong, are no more than an excuse they can manipulate to interfere in other countries' internal affairs, contain their development and grab for themselves political and economic gains.
Fortunately, their sanctimonious lies can never be perfect enough to deceive the entire international community in the face of facts.

You Wenze, spokesperson of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress, said the clauses are unfounded and biased, and have blatantly interfered in China's domestic affairs.
The Taiwan-related content of the act has seriously violated the one-China principle and the three joint communiques between China and the United States, and seriously damaged China-U.S. relations as well as peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, he said.
Taiwan issue is China's domestic affair that allows no interference, the spokesperson added.
On Hong Kong affairs, the spokesperson stressed that a series of violent crimes in Hong Kong have sabotaged public security and orders, seriously challenged rule of law and the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
The spokesperson said extreme violent criminal acts cannot be excuses for any aspirations, and the U.S. attempt to interfere in other countries' domestic affairs using the so-call ""democracy"" and ""human rights"" will be in vain.
On Xinjiang affairs, the spokesperson stressed that Xinjiang-related issues are not about human rights, ethnicity or religion, but about anti-terrorism and de-radicalization. The United States is also a victim of terrorism and should have supported China's anti-terrorism measures, not slander China's efforts in anti-terrorism and de-radicalization.

China Daily writer Li Yang comments: Ironically, Nathan Law has called for students in Hong Kong to boycott classes when the new semester begins early next month.  Some people see his departure as a sign that the chaos in Hong Kong will recede temporarily. As two protests planned by him and his colleagues, in the tax bureau and banks of Hong Kong late last week, have been met with a cold shoulder. Over the past few years, like Nathan Law, at least three to four major separatist leaders from Hong Kong have either served only a symbolic sentence or are still at large, despite the heavy costs they had caused to the city and the country. In 2016, after a series of protests-turned riots came to an end, Edward Leung Tin-kei, went to Harvard University, Chou Yong Kang Alex was admitted by the London School of Economics and Political Science, and Ray Wong Toiyeung received an offer from the University of Oxford. They are all these suspected of colluding with foreign forces and violating the Anti-Secession Law and the National Security Law, as sufficient evidence has been uncovered by various parties exposing the close relations between their scholarship and honors with branches of the US government in Hong Kong. Given the heavy losses caused by the violence Nathan Law and his accomplices have incited, a tacit understanding seems to be forming again between the rioters and the law enforcement department of Hong Kong that the past will be left in the past. As long as the city can regain its order, all misdeeds will be forgiven. The Basic Law and the Constitution have been seriously violated and challenged in the past 10 weeks, and the city has paid a heavy price for the chaos. If all the wrongdoers are let off the hook, the rule of law in Hong Kong will only be challenged again. And the next time when Hong Kong falls into disorder, which is almost predictable as it has achieved nothing definite again this time so far, any outcry to stop violence will only be a new round of the-wolf-is-coming game.

Xi pledged to lift all rural residents living below the current poverty line out of poverty and eliminate poverty in all poor counties.
""The year of 2020 is crucial in winning the anti-poverty battle,"" Xi said. ""The clarion has sounded. We must work together and work hard... to secure a victory in the battle against poverty.""
Xi also extended best wishes to Hong Kong and Hong Kong compatriots.
""The situation in Hong Kong has been everybody's concern over the past few months,"" said Xi.
""Without a harmonious and stable environment, how can there be a home where people can live and work happily!"" Xi said. ""We sincerely hope for the best for Hong Kong and Hong Kong compatriots.""
A prosperous and stable Hong Kong is the aspiration of Hong Kong compatriots, as well as the expectation of the people of the motherland, he said.
Noting that there are both peaceful and eventful times in history, Xi said that ""we are not afraid of winds and rains, or any kind of difficulties.""
He said China will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development, safeguard world peace and promote common development.
""We stand ready to join hands with people around the world to actively build the Belt and Road, push for the building of a community with a shared future for humanity, and work tirelessly to create a better future for humanity,"" Xi said.
""In 2019, we sweated and we toiled as we pressed ahead with concrete efforts for achievements,"" Xi said in his speech, summarizing the progress made in 2019.
China's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to near 100 trillion yuan (14.37 trillion U.S. dollars) while its per capita GDP is expected to reach 10,000 U.S. dollars in 2019, the president noted.
Key progress has been made in efforts to forestall and defuse major risks, carry out targeted poverty alleviation, and prevent and control pollution.
Around 340 poor counties across China will get rid of poverty and more than 10 million people will be lifted out of poverty by the end of 2019, Xi said.
He highlighted advances in science and technology. Chang'e-4 probe made a historic landing on the moon's far side; the Long March-5 Y3 carrier rocket was successfully launched; polar icebreaker Xuelong 2 set sail on its maiden voyage to the Antarctic.
A new batch of pilot free trade zones were established, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone was expanded, the science and technology innovation board was launched smoothly, and over 2 trillion yuan of taxes and fees have been cut over the year.
Xi noted solid reform progress in national defense and armed forces. A grand military parade took place on the National Day. The first Chinese-built aircraft carrier was commissioned.
""The most memorable moment of 2019 was the celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China,"" said Xi, adding that the sheer force of patriotism was felt by the people.
Xi said over the year he traced the routes of China's revolution. ""Our original aspiration and mission are our inexhaustible source of motivation during our Long March of the new era.""
""As usual, no matter how busy I was, I spent time visiting people in the countryside,"" Xi went on to recollect his interaction with the people during the year.
Xi mentioned the names of individuals among many ordinary people who, he said, ""touched us deeply"" over the past year.
Xi highlighted a series of events China hosted over the year including the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, the Beijing International Horticultural Exhibition, the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations and the second China International Import Expo.
Xi said he met with leaders of many countries over the year, sharing with them China's proposals, promoting friendships and enhancing consensus.
The number of countries China has established diplomatic relations with has reached 180, according to Xi.
""We have friends in every corner of the world,"" he said.

The Chinese consulate in Houston has lodged solemn representations, while the Chinese Basketball Association, CCTV sports channel as well as Chinese sponsors and partners have swiftly suspended or terminated their cooperation with Houston Rockets.
Amid ongoing backlash in China, Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta has distanced the team from Morey's tweet, saying he does not speak for the Houston Rockets. ""We are NOT a political organization,"" he stated. The NBA has also expressed disappointment over Morey's tweet in a statement, acknowledging that his views have deeply offended many friends and fans in China.
However, at this point, Morey himself has not yet issued an apology.
Morey's show of support for Hong Kong rioters not only has touched upon China's bottom line, but also runs contrary to the values of the NBA and has damaged his own image and that of the Houston Rockets.
Houston Rockets has enjoyed tremendous popularity in China thanks to Yao Ming. Over the past 17 years, the club has signed sponsorship deals with many Chinese companies. It is fair to say that Morey himself has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the club's popularity in China. However, it is wrong to assume that Chinese fans' love of the team can be taken as indulgence for caprice. Chinese fans are Chinese citizens in the first place. They won't place their love of an NBA team above their country.
Hong Kong is part of China's internal affairs which would tolerate no foreign meddling. Morey and Houston Rockets need to offer a sincere apology to the Chinese public. It would be unwise for any individual to underestimate 1.4 billion Chinese people's readiness to defend their national sovereignty and dignity.

China said it is a ""clumsy farce"" that some Australian media and individuals turned a deaf ear to the fact that Wang Liqiang, the 26-year-old man claimed by Western media as ""former Chinese secret agent"" is a convicted fraud and wanted suspect.
Wang carried a fake Chinese passport and a fake permanent resident ID of Hong Kong, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said on Monday during a regular briefing, adding that the investigation for the case is ongoing.
Geng also urged relevant Australian media and individuals to respect the unambiguous facts, abide by professional ethics, put aside ideological prejudices, and stop doing irresponsible and ridiculous things.
Shanghai police issued a statement late on Saturday that Wang is actually an unemployed fraudster and fugitive who was sentenced for a year and six months in October 2016 by Guangze court in Fujian Province.
Wang was reported by some foreign media including The Sydney Morning Herald to have defected to Australia and confessed that he had worked as a secret agent in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

In a statement made on Friday, Engel said ""allegations of police violence over the past weeks have tarnished Hong Kong's international reputation for good governance and the fair administration of justice."" This accusation gives a false account of the facts, and constitutes severe interference in China's internal affairs.
In the eyes of politicians like Engel, police in Western countries have every right to crack down on violence committed by protestors, such as attacks on police and civilians. But they refer to similar scenes in Hong Kong as peaceful protests. These politicians unreasonably demand that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government lift charges against the so-called peaceful demonstrators. In this narrative, thugs become human rights defenders and freedom fighters. Could they be any more hypocritical?
In the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement, police in New York City used pepper spray and rubber bullets on demonstrators. That same year, British police used high-pressure water guns to disperse rioters in London and other cities. Those operations barely encountered any criticism from Western politicians. But when similar actions were taken in Hong Kong, Western politicians immediately and unscrupulously criticized the right of the police to exercise rightful law enforcement procedures, taking no account of the great restraint that the Hong Kong police have exercised in the face of violence and provocation by protestors.
During British colonial rule of Hong Kong, the governors were appointed by London, and Western politicians didn't care about the city's autonomy, human rights, and freedom. Their only concern was how to rake in profit from this Pearl of the Orient. In the 22 years since China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, the Chinese central government has always adhered to the “One Country, Two Systems” policy and the principle of “Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong”. This has given the people in Hong Kong autonomy, rights, and freedoms never granted by the British colonialists. Hong Kong's rule of law ranking has risen from below 60th place in 1996 to 16th in 2019, four places ahead of the United States. Western politicians should open their eyes to these facts.
And when it comes to media coverage, some members of the Western media, who brand themselves as objective and fair, have deliberately underplayed the extreme provocations of the mobs. Take the riots that happened on June 12 in Admiralty, where the Hong Kong government building and the Legislative Council complex are located. A British media outlet heavily reported on the police firing rubber bullets and using tear gas at the mobs while mentioning none of the facts that the mobs attacked police line of defense and used lethal weapons. On July 14, a Hong Kong police officer's finger was bitten off by a protestor, but Western media deliberately played it down. A week later, the behavior of some mobs who defaced the national emblem of China, which is not tolerated within any sovereign country, was again played down by some Western media. How could these media outlets talk about objectivity and justice?
Interfering in the internal affairs of other countries violates international law and the basic norms of international relations. Using double standards to make irresponsible remarks about the affairs of other countries is a customary tactic used by some politicians and media in the West. The latest remarks made by those politicians and the media on the recent protests in Hong Kong aimed to cause chaos in the city and contain China's overall development. The Hong Kong government, the police, and the people should never tolerate any behavior by external forces that seek to wreck the foundation of rule of law in Hong Kong. And Beijing will never tolerate chaos that undermines China's sovereignty and Hong Hong's prosperity and stability.

HONG KONG, Aug. 18 -- As protracted violence roiled Hong Kong, the Asian financial hub -- known as the ""Pearl of the Orient"" -- faces a dimmed economic outlook in the coming months. Calls are mounting among the public for immediate actions to stop violence and restore order.
The demonstrations, which started over planned amendments to Hong Kong's ordinances concerning fugitive offenders, widened and turned violent over the past two months.
Protesters exhibited all manners of blatant destructive activities from blocking railways and tunnels, attacking police, defacing the national emblem and the national flag, to paralyzing the operations of Hong Kong International Airport, and brutally assaulting innocent people.
The flagrant violence has already taken a heavy toll on Hong Kong's already-weak economy.
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government revised downward the real economic growth forecast for 2019 as a whole to 0 to 1 percent, from an earlier estimate of 2 to 3 percent.
According to Paul Chan, the HKSAR government's financial secretary, the risk of Hong Kong experiencing an economic downturn is significantly rising in the face of internal and external difficulties.
He said the recent social incidents have hit retail, restaurants and tourism, worsening economic recession.

TOURISM HIT HARD
Hong Kong's tourism sector has turned from a summer boom into a chilly winter of unemployment and economic hardship, said Wong Ka-ngai, chairman of the Hong Kong Tour Guides General Union.
A pillar industry for Hong Kong, tourism employed more than 270,000 people, contributed 4.5 percent of GDP to Hong Kong's economy in 2017.
However, Wong said, the impact now is ""even worse than during the 2003 SARS outbreak.""
""Many mainland tourists don't have the desire to come to Hong Kong anymore. They make up almost 80 percent of our market,"" he said.
Since the violent protests began, more than 20 countries and regions have warned their residents against visiting Hong Kong.
In the June-July period, average earnings for tourism workers plunged by 74 percent, while the number of tours in Hong Kong fell 74 percent on average, according to a recent survey of 1,012 people with the union.
""The violence is taking a toll on our life and Hong Kong's economy,"" said Dicky Yip, a tour guide.
Yip, 46, has made no money over the last two months, leaving his wife as the only breadwinner for the family of six.
""About 80 percent of the group tours of my company come from the mainland, and most of them were canceled in the past two months,"" Yip said.
The tour guide said he had no work to do since July when he should have been busy taking tourists to popular locales such as Wong Tai Sin Temple, Victoria Peak and Repulse Bay.
""Violent activities by a small group of people hurt the image of Hong Kong as a whole in the eyes of tourists. It is not acceptable,"" Yip said.

SMALL BUSINESS CHILLS
The clashes initiated by radical groups have not only disturbed business and commercial order but have frayed Hong Kong residents' nerves and made lives difficult.
Siu Lau runs a pharmacy selling dried seafood and traditional Chinese medicines in Wanchai, the wealthiest district in Hong Kong. ""My shop has been open for more than 30 years. The recent turmoil caused a 50 percent drop in our business,"" he said.
Small and medium-sized businesses like Lau's account for 98 percent of the total number of Hong Kong businesses and contribute 40 percent of the HKSAR's employment.
""Most of our customers are regulars, some of them told me that they were not in the mood to shop,"" said Lau, 60, as he works with his wife in a 20-square-meter store.
Born and raised in Hong Kong, Lau was saddened by the series of violence that threaten to derail Hong Kong's economic future. ""The economy will keep going down if violent and lawless protests continue,"" he said with a sigh.
Dim-sum seller Ah Ling, in her fifties, complained about sliding sales. She works in a small shop selling snacks and drinks in Kwun Tong, the east of Kowloon peninsula, one of the most populated districts in Hong Kong.
""We are losing customers, as you can see, people don't have to queue up. It was nothing like what it was before. Sales keep dropping,"" she said.
The public in Hong Kong has been irked by escalated street violence and mob behaviors. Over 470,000 people gathered Saturday in a rally at Tamar Park to demand peace and stability.
Joe Chau Kwok-ming, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Small and Medium Business, said the economic downturn is putting an extra squeeze on the small and medium-sized firms.
Many enterprises have seen a 30 percent drop in business and pay cut for employees in recent months. Chau warns that if the economy continues to deteriorate, there will be a wave of shop closures and the unemployment rate is bound to rise.

CALL FOR ORDER
A sound business environment is the backbone of Hong Kong's economy, derived from the rule of law, convenient transportation, a developed financial industry, efficient public service and the presence of international talent.
The current chaos has a direct impact on tourism, and business negotiations in the short term, but in a long run, it will threaten Hong Kong's role as the international financial and trade hub, said Witman Hung, an HKSAR deputy to the National People's Congress.
""Finance always thrives in the safest place. When Hong Kong stops being safe, investors will have to think twice. Its appeal to high-end talent will fade away and the establishment as an innovation center will also be frustrated. The effects will be detrimental,"" Hung said.
The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong in its recent survey found that international businesses are already reporting serious consequences, ranging from an immediate hit to revenue caused by disruption to supply chains and consumption, to longer-term doubts over canceled events and shelved investments.
To prevent Hong Kong's economy from tanking, the HKSAR government on Thursday announced a package of economy-boosting measures with a total value of 19.1 billion HK dollars (about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars).
Measures range from waiving government fees and charges on enterprises for 12 months, introducing a new loan guarantee product for smaller companies to reducing salary tax, providing subsidies to school students and extra allowance for social security recipients.
Among the measures, an increase in the amount of personal income that's tax-free alone is estimated to cost 1.84 billion HK dollars (about 235 million U.S. dollars) and benefit 1.4 million people.
Paul Chan expressed the belief that the slew of economic stimulus measures will lead to a 0.3 percent economic growth.
According to HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam, the measures are designed to help small and medium-sized enterprises cope with the deteriorating economic situation and alleviate people's burden.
She stressed the most important task at the moment is to put an end to violence and restore social order. ""We all have a stake in Hong Kong.""

In the June-July period, average earnings for tourism workers plunged by 74 percent, while the number of tours in Hong Kong fell 74 percent on average, according to a recent survey of 1,012 people with the union. ""The violence is taking a toll on our life and Hong Kong's economy,"" said Dicky Yip, a tour guide. Yip, 46, has made no money over the last two months, leaving his wife as the only breadwinner for the family of six. ""About 80 percent of the group tours of my company come from the mainland, and most of them were canceled in the past two months,"" Yip said. The tour guide said he had no work to do since July when he should have been busy taking tourists to popular locales such as Wong Tai Sin Temple, Victoria Peak and Repulse Bay. ""Violent activities by a small group of people hurt the image of Hong Kong as a whole in the eyes of tourists. It is not acceptable,"" Yip said.  A protester deliberately blocks the subway safety door to stop the train departing at Fortress Hill metro station in Hong Kong, south China, Aug. 5, 2019. (Xinhua) SMALL BUSINESS CHILLS The clashes initiated by radical groups have not only disturbed business and commercial order but have frayed Hong Kong residents' nerves and made lives difficult. Siu Lau runs a pharmacy selling dried seafood and traditional Chinese medicines in Wanchai, the wealthiest district in Hong Kong. ""My shop has been open for more than 30 years. The recent turmoil caused a 50 percent drop in our business,"" he said. Small and medium-sized businesses like Lau's account for 98 percent of the total number of Hong Kong businesses and contribute 40 percent of the HKSAR's employment. ""Most of our customers are regulars, some of them told me that they were not in the mood to shop,"" said Lau, 60, as he works with his wife in a 20-square-meter store. Born and raised in Hong Kong, Lau was saddened by the series of violence that threaten to derail Hong Kong's economic future. ""The economy will keep going down if violent and lawless protests continue,"" he said with a sigh. Dim-sum seller Ah Ling, in her fifties, complained about sliding sales. She works in a small shop selling snacks and drinks in Kwun Tong, the east of Kowloon peninsula, one of the most populated districts in Hong Kong. ""We are losing customers, as you can see, people don't have to queue up. It was nothing like what it was before. Sales keep dropping,"" she said. The public in Hong Kong has been irked by escalated street violence and mob behaviors. Over 470,000 people gathered Saturday in a rally at Tamar Park to demand peace and stability. Joe Chau Kwok-ming, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Small and Medium Business, said the economic downturn is putting an extra squeeze on the small and medium-sized firms. Many enterprises have seen a 30 percent drop in business and pay cut for employees in recent months. Chau warns that if the economy continues to deteriorate, there will be a wave of shop closures and the unemployment rate is bound to rise.  People from all walks of life take part in a rally to demand peace and stability at Tamar Park in south China's Hong Kong, Aug. 17, 2019. (Xinhua/Wang Shen) CALL FOR ORDER A sound business environment is the backbone of Hong Kong's economy, derived from the rule of law, convenient transportation, a developed financial industry, efficient public service and the presence of international talent. The current chaos has a direct impact on tourism, and business negotiations in the short term, but in a long run, it will threaten Hong Kong's role as the international financial and trade hub, said Witman Hung, an HKSAR deputy to the National People's Congress. ""Finance always thrives in the safest place. When Hong Kong stops being safe, investors will have to think twice. Its appeal to high-end talent will fade away and the establishment as an innovation center will also be frustrated. The effects will be detrimental,"" Hung said. The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong in its recent survey found that international businesses are already reporting serious consequences, ranging from an immediate hit to revenue caused by disruption to supply chains and consumption, to longer-term doubts over canceled events and shelved investments. To prevent Hong Kong's economy from tanking, the HKSAR government on Thursday announced a package of economy-boosting measures with a total value of 19.1 billion HK dollars (about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars). Measures range from waiving government fees and charges on enterprises for 12 months, introducing a new loan guarantee product for smaller companies to reducing salary tax, providing subsidies to school students and extra allowance for social security recipients. Among the measures, an increase in the amount of personal income that's tax-free alone is estimated to cost 1.84 billion HK dollars (about 235 million U.S. dollars) and benefit 1.4 million people. Paul Chan expressed the belief that the slew of economic stimulus measures will lead to a 0.3 percent economic growth. According to HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam, the measures are designed to help small and medium-sized enterprises cope with the deteriorating economic situation and alleviate people's burden. She stressed the most important task at the moment is to put an end to violence and restore social order. ""We all have a stake in Hong Kong."""	CCTV

HONG KONG - Hong Kong's Secretary for Transport and Housing Frank Chan Fan and MTR Corporation managers on Monday condemned violence by protesters that damaged the city's subway facilities on Sunday.
They also appealed to members of the public to respect the responsibilities of MTR's frontline staff as well the general public's right to travel.
Their response came after they accompanied Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to the area around Central station, Hong Kong Island. On Sunday, radicals started fires near several entrances of the station and smashed windows.
""MTR is the most important part of Hong Kong's transportation system,"" said Rex Auyeung Pak-kuen, chairman of MTR Corporation, noting how the corporation facilitated on an average 5 million passenger trips every day.
MTR CEO Jacob Kam Chak-pui expressed his gratitude to MTR staff members who have been working around the clock to repair the damaged facilities and keep train services running. ""MTR is the pride of Hong Kong,"" Kam said, adding that the smooth operation of the city's metro system is in the interest of all Hong Kong residents.
All exits of the Central station were open on Monday, thanks to overnight repair work by MTR staff members and an enterprising cleaning crew that started work early in morning.
But anxiety and worry still leave a discernible mark on this busy business district in the heart of Hong Kong Island.
Passers-by took photos as they walked past exit F, recognizing it as the site of a huge fire started by violent protesters the previous night. Burn marks on the floor were plainly visible as were charred trash bins by the pavement.
A broken glass wall at exit K has been covered temporarily with plastic curtains. Garbage thrown down the stairs by the radical protesters on Sunday night was removed by cleaning workers. Dozens of planters pushed down the stairs were retrieved and returned to Statue Square in Central.
A cleaner who wishes to stay anonymous said she arrived at 7 am to erase the graffiti sprayed indiscriminately on outer walls of metro stations, phone booths, and advertising boards.
""(These facilities) They have nothing to do with the protests and should not be damaged,"" she said, busy rubbing with a rag.
On Sunday, most shops and restaurants in the area closed right after the MTR station announced suspension of services at 4 pm.
Nass, 28, a shop manager in Central, said Sunday was the first time his establishment had closed earlier than usual in recent months. ""But if it (the violence and vandalism) continues, or occurs even once a month, our company may have to lay off some staff,"" said Nass, adding that the retail heartland of Hong Kong continued to see fewer visitors since the protests began three months ago.
People usually went shopping with families and friends over the weekend, but nowadays many avoided going out on weekends, said Nass.
Yadav, 76, a resident of Indian origin, said he had to walk to work at 8:30 pm on Sunday because buses and metro were out of service at that time as chaos reigned in the area.
He found it unbelievable that no one except patrolling police officers could be seen on the streets. On Sunday nights, the area is usually crowded with visitors.
""I don't know when this will stop. But what protesters did was very bad. People living here are having a very difficult time,"" Yadav said.

The spike in infections and fatalities comes after Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said early on Sunday that effective immediately, the government is locking down the entire northern Lombardy region as well as several provinces in the nearby regions of Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont and Veneto in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.
ROME, March 8 -- A total of 6,387 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Italy since the epidemic first broke out here over two weeks ago, the Civil Protection Department said Sunday.
In addition, 366 people have died and 622 recovered, Civil Protection Department Chief Angelo Borrelli told reporters at a televised press conference.
This was up from 5,061 cases, 589 recoveries and 233 deaths announced in an official tally on Saturday evening.
Most of Sunday's fatalities occurred in Lombardy (113), followed by the regions of Emilia-Romagna (eight), Veneto (five), Lazio (two), Liguria (two), Friuli Venezia Giulia (one), Marche (one), and Puglia (one), said Borrelli.
Borrelli also broke down the Sunday death tally by age ranges: one fatality occurred in the 0-49 age group, one in the 50-59 age group, 14 in the 60-69 age group, 39 in the 70-79 age group, 60 among people aged 80-89, and 18 deaths occurred among those aged over 90.
Of those who tested positive, 2,180 people are under home isolation, 3,557 are hospitalized with symptoms, and 650 are in intensive care, said Borrelli, who also serves as extraordinary commissioner for the coronavirus emergency.
The spike in infections and fatalities comes after Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said early on Sunday that effective immediately, the government is locking down the entire northern Lombardy region as well as several provinces in the nearby regions of Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont and Veneto in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.
According to the government decree that goes into effect until April 3, unprecedented restrictions will be taken as preventive measures, impacting some 16 million people in the north, which accounts for over one-six of the country's population.
Also on Sunday, the Health Ministry said in a statement that Health Minister Roberto Speranza has spoken on the phone with World Health Organization (WHO) Europe Regional Director Hans Kluge to illustrate the government's new restrictive measures.
In a tweet, Kluge expressed full support for the measures taken by Italy.
""Italy has taken a brave decision to contain & mitigate the risk of COVID-19 for its population. WHO fully supports the commitment of the government at state & regions, the people of Italy, all doctors, nurses & health staff at the frontline. United with Italy,"" Kluge wrote.
The WHO, which is the health agency of the United Nations, had sent a Rapid Response Team (RRT) on a 12-day mission to Italy which ended on March 6.
Its recommendations included ""maintaining a strong focus on containment measures across the country, and prioritizing the identification and testing of suspect cases. In areas with wider virus transmission, they recommend a combination of strategies that prioritizes patient isolation and care and hospital preparedness to prevent disease and protect lives,"" the WHO said in a statement.

His message followed media reports that hundreds of people flocked to northern train stations in a bid to get home to other regions before the government lockdown went into effect.
Many residents of Italy's impoverished southern regions move to the wealthier northern regions in order to study and find jobs.
""I speak to you as if you were my children, brothers, grandchildren: stop and go back,"" Emiliano wrote.
""Do not bring the epidemic ... into your land, Puglia, by running away (from the northern regions placed under lockdown) to avoid the government's decree,"" the governor pleaded.
""This exodus does not help you and is harmful to your loved ones who await you in Puglia,"" Emiliano wrote.
Also on Sunday, Italian President Sergio Mattarella said in a speech to the nation that ""for reasons we all know, this year we will not be able to celebrate International Women's Day at the Quirinal (presidential palace in Rome).""
""First of all I wish to express gratitude to the many women who are hard at work in hospitals, laboratories, and red zones (quarantine areas) to fight the spread of the virus,"" Mattarella said.

Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, is expected to attend a ceremony marking the anniversary, which falls on Dec. 20, and the inauguration of the fifth-term government of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR). He will also inspect the region.
Over the years, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core has unswervingly implemented the policies of ""one country, two systems,"" ""the people of Macao governing Macao,"" and a high degree of autonomy for the region, and has firmly supported the exercising of law-based governance by the chief executive and government of the Macao SAR as well as integration of Macao's development into that of the country.
Guided by this support, Macao has shown the world the success of ""one country, two systems"" with Macao characteristics.
SUPPORT FOR MACAO
A city with only around 30 square km of land and a 670,000-strong population, Macao nevertheless enjoys significant attention from the central authorities.
In December 2012, not long after being elected general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, Xi met with Macao SAR Chief Executive Chui Sai On in Beijing and expressed his full confidence in Macao's development prospects.
Xi on various occasions gave policy directions for Macao: integrate into the country's development, nurture new growth drivers, promote appropriately diversified and sustainable economic development, prioritize economic development and livelihood improvement.
Meeting Chui who was on a duty visit to Beijing in December 2015, Xi said the central authorities attach great importance to Macao's prosperity and stability.
Support was given to Macao in building the region into a world center of tourism and leisure as well as a platform for commercial and trade cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.
Macao was also encouraged to boost the sectors of conferences and exhibitions, traditional Chinese medicine, education services and cultural creation.
Limited land area has long been a bottleneck of Macao's development.
In December 2014, Xi announced the central authorities' decision to start working on the demarcation of Macao's maritime waters.
According to a map released by the central government a year later, an 85-square-km sea area shall be administered by the Macao SAR.
Macao's development space has also expanded over the years as it kept integrating its development into the country's development blueprint such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).
In October 2018, Xi came to Zhuhai, the mainland city closest to Macao, to announce the opening of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge.
Xi has also written letters to university administrators, elementary school pupils and elderly care center volunteer workers in Macao, expressing the hope that they pass on fine patriotic traditions.
""ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS"" WITH MACAO CHARACTERISTICS
The CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core has made a series of discourses on ""one country, two systems.""
Xi has stressed both adhering to the ""one country"" principle and respecting the differences of the ""two systems"" at the 15th anniversary of Macao's return to the motherland.
People in Macao have kept a firm hold of the core requirement that the ""one country"" is the prerequisite and basis of the ""two systems,"" and have opened new prospects for the successful practice of ""one country, two systems"" with Macao characteristics.
A series of campaigns have been carried out by Macao since 2015 to ensure China's Constitution is well respected, observed and safeguarded in the SAR.
The Macao SAR has used its legislative power to safeguard national security and unity. In 2018, the Macao SAR Safeguarding National Security Commission, headed by the chief executive, was established.
More than just stable, Macao has achieved an economic miracle.
Macao's gross domestic product surged to 444.7 billion patacas in 2018 (about 55 billion U.S. dollars) from around 51.9 billion patacas in 1999, with the unemployment rate dropping to 1.8 percent.
Patriotism is a core social value. The national flag flies high at all levels of educational institutions in Macao, from primary schools to colleges and universities.
In September, meeting with the newly elected fifth-term chief executive of the Macao SAR Ho Iat Seng in Beijing, Xi said ""one country, two systems"" has proven to be workable and enjoys popular support.
Macao has shown the world a successful practice of ""one country, two systems"" with Macao characteristics, Xi said.
TOGETHER FOR BRIGHTER FUTURE
People in Macao know that the future of Macao and the mainland are closely linked together.
Xi also spoke of the common progress and shared development between Macao and the mainland when he met with Chui in Beijing in December 2013.
On the one hand, Macao is expected to play its unique role and actively participate in the country's initiatives such as the BRI. On the other hand, key measures have been rolled out to support Macao's development.
The 19th CPC National Congress report, for example, mentioned giving priority to the development of the GBA, cooperation between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, and regional cooperation in the pan-Pearl River Delta.
The outline development plan for the GBA designates Macao as one of the four core cities in the bay area, along with Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
Hengqin in the city of Zhuhai is being developed as a model zone for Guangdong-Macao cooperation.
In October 2018, Xi visited a traditional Chinese medicine industrial park there and said the original goal of establishing Hengqin new area was to create conditions for the diversified development of Macao's economy.
Xi called for more policy support for developing new industries to help Macao's economy gain greater vitality.
Then came four state-level key laboratories, a youth business incubator, support for collaboration between Macao and mainland universities, border-crossing facilitation and major transport infrastructure projects, with more developments in the pipeline.
Twenty years after returning to the motherland, Macao stands ready to achieve even greater development.
Xi expressed his confidence in common progress when he spoke at a reception celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in late September.
He said: ""We are confident that with the full backing of the motherland and the concerted efforts of our compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao who love the motherland as well as their communities, Hong Kong and Macao will prosper and progress alongside the mainland and embrace an even brighter future!""

The demonstration, which was called for by the High Commission of the Great March of Return, included all Palestinian factions.
The protests took place in front of the headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in central Gaza city, and went toward the United Nations headquarter in the west of Gaza.
The participants in the demonstrations held black flags and banners reading ""Together to drop the Deal of Century,"" ""The Bahrain conference will be failed"" and ""Palestine and Jerusalem are not for sale.""
Mohammed Haneyia, a 28-year-old participant, said to Xinhua that ""we are here to send our message to the U.S., Israel, Bahrain and all the Arab countries that we will not accept to give up any inch of our Palestinian lands for money.""

Mushir al-Masri, the leader of Hamas, told Xinhua that ""the conference will be failed, especially as we are in the process to build a national liberation strategy to address the serious repercussions of the conference.""
The economic workshop, kicked off on Tuesday, was attended by the host country Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Morocco.
Jared Kushner, senior advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump, underlined Washington's 50-billion-U.S.-dollar economic vision for the Palestinians, saying the 10-year vision aims to more than double the GDP of the Palestinians, create over 1 million jobs for them, reduce their unemployment rate to nearly single digits and cut their poverty rate by half.
Analysts believe that the ""Deal of the Century"" will face great obstacles in its implementation, especially in light of the Palestinian consensus on its rejection.
However, the political analyst Ibrahim Abrash expected that the U.S. administration will impose the ""Deal of the Century"" as a reality in light of its military and economic hegemony on the countries of the world, noting that this may occur if the Palestinian division continues.

""Rioters took the peaceful procession as their cover and conducted illegal and violent acts,"" Chief Superintendent Kwok Ka-chuen told reporters. ""On account of public safety, the procession had to be called off after communication between the police and organizers.""
The New Year Day march started at around 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday and ended three hours later after rioters began to set fires and trash shops and banks along the designated route.
The march was initially planned to finish at 10 p.m.
""Police have always supported processions that are in peaceful and rational manners. Yesterday's procession was peaceful in the beginning. But after two hours several violent acts erupted,"" Senior Superintendent NG Lok-chun of (Operations) Hong Kong Island said at a briefing.
Between December 31, 2019, and January 1, 2020, police arrested 420 people for offenses including unlawful assembly and possession of offensive weapons.
Among those arrested, 207 are men and 113 are women. Kwok said they're aged between 12 and 81 and added that four officers were injured in the arrest operations over the past two days.
He stressed that nobody should be present at a riot scene, no matter what their excuse is.
""No one has the privilege to stay in a riot when police officers have given repeated warnings for people to leave. You can claim to be a first aider, a human rights observer, you name it. But this doesn't give you any exemption from the legal liability from taking part in a riot,"" said Kwok. 
His colleague Senior Superintendent Ng Lok-chun also noted that people will be released straight away if preliminary investigations find they have done nothing wrong, rebuking accusations that officers had abused their powers.

Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Chief Executive Carrie Lam announces on June 15, 2019 that the HKSAR government will suspend the amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance until further communication and explanation work is completed.(Xinhua/Li Gang)
HONG KONG, June 15 -- Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced Saturday that the HKSAR government will suspend the amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance until further communication and explanation work is completed.
""I now announce that the government has decided to suspend the legislative amendment exercise,"" Lam told a press conference Saturday afternoon at the HKSAR government headquarters building.
The HKSAR government's secretary for security will send a letter to the Legislative Council (LegCo) president to withdraw the notice of resumption of second reading debate on the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill, and the LegCo will halt its work in relation to the bill until the HKSAR government completes its work in communication, explanation and listening to opinions, Lam said.
The bill, tabled by the HKSAR government at the LegCo in April, aims to deal with a murder case that happened in China's Taiwan but involves a Hong Kong suspect who has returned to Hong Kong, and to fill loopholes in HKSAR's existing legal framework concerning mutual legal assistance in criminal matters.
Lam said the HKSAR government has been discussing with various sectors of the community in a rational manner and has introduced amendments to the proposal on two occasions to ease the concerns of society and narrow differences, including increasing the threshold for fugitive offenders surrender and introducing additional human rights safeguards.
""My relevant colleagues and I have made our best efforts, but I have to admit that our explanation and communication work has not been sufficient or effective,"" she said, adding that the HKSAR government will do more work in this regard.
""I want to stress the government is adopting an open mind to heed comprehensively different views in society towards the bill,"" she added.
To deal with the Taiwan murder case, the HKSAR government has been trying to get the bill passed ahead of the LegCo summer recess in July. However, in consideration of Taiwan's overt and clear expression that it would not accede to the HKSAR government's suggested arrangement in the transfer of the concerned suspect, the original urgency to pass the bill in this legislative year is perhaps no longer there, Lam said.
""We have no intention to set a deadline for this work and promise to report to and consult members of the Legislative Council panel on security before we decide on the next step forward,"" she said.
The bill was originally scheduled to be discussed at a LegCo meeting on June 12. The meeting was postponed due to violent conflicts between protesters and police around the complex of the HKSAR government and LegCo.
""As a responsible government, we have to maintain law and order on the one hand, and evaluate the situation for the greatest interests of Hong Kong, including restoring calmness in society as soon as possible and avoiding any more injuries to law enforcement officers and citizens,"" Lam said.
In response to media questioning, Lam clarified that the amendments were initiated and managed by the HKSAR government and it would not withdraw the proposal since the original purposes were right.
The Chinese central government expressed support, respect and understanding for the decision announced by Lam on Saturday.
""We support, respect and understand the decision,"" said a spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, noting that the central government will continue to support Lam and the HKSAR government's governance in accordance with the law and their efforts with people from all walks of life to safeguard Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
Noting that the HKSAR police have always been the protector of Hong Kong residents and society, the spokesperson said the central government strongly condemns relevant violent activities and firmly supports the police in cracking down on such activities and police efforts to safeguard Hong Kong's rule of law and social stability.
Geng Shuang, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the policies of ""one country, two systems,"" ""Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong,"" and a high degree of autonomy have been faithfully implemented, and the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people have been fully guaranteed in accordance with the law, which has been widely recognized.
""I want to reiterate that Hong Kong is China's special administrative region and its affairs are purely China's internal affairs that brook no interference by any country, organization or individual,"" Geng said, adding that China is firmly determined to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests and maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
An official in charge of the liaison office of the central government in the HKSAR said that since she came into office two years ago, Lam has been upholding the principle of ""setting no easy goals and avoiding no difficult tasks"" and leading the HKSAR government in governing Hong Kong in accordance with the law and assuming a proactive role, which has always been highly recognized and fully trusted by the central government.
The liaison office will remain steadfast in supporting the chief executive and the HKSAR government in governing Hong Kong in accordance with law, maintaining the order of rule of law in Hong Kong society and safeguarding the lawful rights and interests of Hong Kong residents, so as to secure Hong Kong as a prosperous and stable home for all, the official said.
An official in charge of the Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the HKSAR also voiced continuous staunch support for Lam and the HKSAR government in governing Hong Kong in accordance with the law, safeguarding the country's sovereignty, security and development interests, and upholding Hong Kong's enduring prosperity and stability.
The official strongly condemned the violent acts by some people and voiced firm support for the Hong Kong police force to mete out punishment in accordance with law, stressing that freedom is by no means without boundaries, and rights must be exercised within the framework of the rule of law.
The decision to suspend the legislative amendment exercise was also supported by various sectors of the Hong Kong society.
Voicing support to the decision, the Non-official Members of the HKSAR Executive Council (ExCo Members) said in a statement that they would continue to offer their full support for the chief executive, and would call on members of the public to adopt a calm and rational manner when expressing their views, and to safeguard the civilized, free, open and pluralistic society of Hong Kong.
Speaking through a spokesperson, president of the LegCo Andrew Leung said he understood the decision and believed it was made after carefully listening to the voices of various sectors of the society.
Noting that the decision would enable more explanation, he appealed to the public to express their views in a peaceful and rational manner that reflects Hong Kong's long-respected spirit of rule of law.
The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC) Chairman Aron Harilela said the HKGCC welcomed the HKSAR government's decision for it would allow things to cool down and let everyone return to rational debate.
""We look forward to the government continuing to engage in constructive discussions with stakeholders and the public to address and eliminate doubts about the bill,"" added Harilela.   Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Chief Executive Carrie Lam announces on June 15, 2019 that the HKSAR government will suspend the amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance until further communication and explanation work is completed.(Xinhua/Li Gang) HONG KONG, June 15 -- Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced Saturday that the HKSAR government will suspend the amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance until further communication and explanation work is completed.

The new parliamentary session will begin on Oct. 14.   A number of opposition MPs have written to the Palace to ask for an audience with the Queen to plead for the suspension plan to be overturned, according to social media messages Wednesday night.   As a public petition to parliament headed towards a million names, people gathered in London and in major provincial cities to protest at the move.   In Manchester's Albert Square, hundreds of protestors chanted ""stop the coup"" in one of the many quickly arranged protests.   The decision to suspend the British Parliament means the seat of government will essentially shut its doors until Oct. 14 when the British monarch will deliver the Queen's speech to kick-start a new session of parliament.   Although there will only be two weeks until Brexit day, Johnson insisted in Downing Street Wednesday that politicians will have enough time to debate Britain's future in the EU.   Jacob Rees-Mogg, one of the senior MPs who held a meeting with Queen Elizabeth at Balmoral, her retreat in Scotland, defended the process.   He said: ""It's the normal functioning of our constitution. The Government is working very hard to get a deal, as the Prime Minister has said.""   Former Conservative prime minister John Major said he is seeking legal advice on whether he can challenge Johnson's decision to prorogue parliament.   In a statement Major said: ""I have no doubt that the prime minister's motive in seeking prorogation is to bypass a sovereign parliament that opposes his policy. As events unfold I will continue to seek advice on the legality of this, and other matters, but will be making no further comment.""   The campaign group, Another Europe is possible, organised a protest against the prorogation of parliament on College Green outside the Houses of Parliament. Some protestors marched along Whitehall to Downing Street.   The Metropolitan Police dispatched teams of riot cops to Westminster to ensure public order was kept.   As well as Manchester, anti-prorogation rallies took place in Leeds, Edinburgh and other towns and cities.   John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, accused Johnson of committing a constitutional outrage by asking the Queen to suspend Parliament weeks before the Brexit deadline.   ""However it is dressed up it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of prorogation now would be to stop Parliament debating Brexit and performing its duty,"" he said.   In Cardiff the Welsh Assembly's First Minister Mark Drakeford recalled assembly from its summer recess to discuss the suspension of the Westminster parliament.   Drakeford said the suspension of parliament was undemocratic and that Assembly Members in Wales should be able to speak for their constituents on the issue.  In Scotland, the Scottish Nationalist Party's Europe spokesman Stephen Gethins said the request to suspend Parliament means Prime Minister Johnson has ""moved into tinpot dictatorship territory"".   ""What is clear from this action is that Johnson knows he doesn't have the support in Parliament,"" added Gethins.  "	CCTV

Residents of Mati and Kineta, coastal resorts that were damaged by wildfires, protest in Athens, Greece, on May 16, 2019. Ten months after losing relatives, friends, neighbors, homes and happiness during wildfires which swept through two once idyllic coastal resorts near Athens, a group of fire-stricken Greeks protested on Thursday outside the Greek Environment Ministry over the delays in the reconstruction process. On July 23, 2018, two fires which broke out in Kineta, 45 kilometers west of the Greek capital and in Mati, 30 km to the east, claimed 102 lives, leaving behind numerous injured, hundreds of destroyed or damaged houses and many acres of charred down forested land. (Xinhua/Marios Lolos)
ATHENS, May 16 -- Ten months after losing relatives, friends, neighbors, homes and happiness during wildfires which swept through two once idyllic coastal resorts near Athens, a group of fire-stricken Greeks protested on Thursday outside the Greek Environment Ministry over the delays in the reconstruction process.
On July 23, 2018 two fires which broke out in Kineta, 45 kilometers west of the Greek capital and in Mati, 30 km to the east, claimed 102 lives, leaving behind numerous injured, hundreds of destroyed or damaged houses and many acres of charred down forested land.
In particular the fire at Mati, where all 102 casualties were, was the deadliest in a decade in Greece, leaving the entire nation in shock.
In the first days and weeks after the tragedy officials pledged the state's full support to the residents so they can heal their wounds and stand on their feet again.
On Thursday people protested that ten months later not much has been done yet, after the initial financial handouts.
""We were burned by the fire, but indifference is killing us,"" read banners raised by protesters.
Ten months later, only a few dozen licenses for reconstruction of houses have been issued, more than 120 families are still housed in camps, while others have found shelter in relatives' homes and infrastructure projects are not progressing fast enough, they said.
""They promised us last summer that this year we would all have returned to our homes. There are people who have lost their loved ones, there are people with burns who are struggling everyday visiting hospitals, with no aid, paying on their own. This is what they must see in Mati, how we are living,"" Yannis Koletis told Xinhua.
His home was destroyed by the blaze and he is one of the people still accommodated in camps.
""We are not illegal, it is not our fault that we are fire stricken,"" he said, referring to the debate that started in the wake of the destruction on the residents' share of the blame.
Government officials and experts said that many of the houses in Mati and Kineta had been built without proper licenses and urban planning and many victims were trapped in narrow streets leading to dead ends, as the exits to the sea were blocked by summer homes.
People who gathered outside the ministry on Thursday insisted that all this talk was fake news and most of them had built their homes with licenses and were paying all relevant taxes to the state for decades.
""So many years that we were there and we were paying all this money for electricity, water, municipality fees, real property tax, other taxes, transfers, contracts, everything, we were not illegal. We were good, because we were paying the state. It is time the state paid for us,"" Antonis Petridis, member of the coordinating committee of Kineta residents told Xinhua.
""We are hearing only words, but they should turn them into actions. There are fire-stricken people today who are homeless and are sleeping once here, the next time elsewhere. They are being fed at soup kitchens. This must end. They should give a solution,"" he said.
""We have been abandoned at the mercy of God. After the fire, floods came and all homes flooded, they were all damaged, including those which had not been affected by the fire,"" Lefteris Papatheodorou, another Kineta resident, told Xinhua.
""Only a few things have been done, not so much, according to what they had pledged. We are still in the pledges stage. Nothing has materialized. Mati is like a cemetery. It was a paradise. We ask that people return to their homes,"" said Vassilis Vrettos who was wearing a black t-shirt with the date that changed dramatically their lives printed on.
Vrettos did not lose his home, but he grieves for friends and neighbors who perished in the fire. All residents are in pain, regardless of losses, he said.
Panagiota Vlachea, lost two family homes in Mati and is living on the rent, waiting for a license to start over again.
""They do make some steps, but 10 months have passed and we still don't even have licenses. We want to see our homes rebuilt. It is simple. That's it. We are not asking much, only the fundamental,"" she told Xinhua.
""Ten months later we are living in a bombarded city. Why? Nothing has been done. Why? I am a resident of Mati living in a bombarded city and I demand a change tomorrow. That's all,"" Varvara Kasselouri said.
In a press statement issued following a meeting between a delegation of protesters and Environment Minister George Stathakis, it was pledged that the procedures for the issuance of licenses and reconstruction projects will accelerate.   Residents of Mati and Kineta, coastal resorts that were damaged by wildfires, protest in Athens, Greece, on May 16, 2019.

On Thursday people protested that ten months later not much has been done yet, after the initial financial handouts. ""We were burned by the fire, but indifference is killing us,"" read banners raised by protesters. Ten months later, only a few dozen licenses for reconstruction of houses have been issued, more than 120 families are still housed in camps, while others have found shelter in relatives' homes and infrastructure projects are not progressing fast enough, they said. ""They promised us last summer that this year we would all have returned to our homes. There are people who have lost their loved ones, there are people with burns who are struggling everyday visiting hospitals, with no aid, paying on their own. This is what they must see in Mati, how we are living,"" Yannis Koletis told Xinhua. His home was destroyed by the blaze and he is one of the people still accommodated in camps. ""We are not illegal, it is not our fault that we are fire stricken,"" he said, referring to the debate that started in the wake of the destruction on the residents' share of the blame. Government officials and experts said that many of the houses in Mati and Kineta had been built without proper licenses and urban planning and many victims were trapped in narrow streets leading to dead ends, as the exits to the sea were blocked by summer homes. People who gathered outside the ministry on Thursday insisted that all this talk was fake news and most of them had built their homes with licenses and were paying all relevant taxes to the state for decades. ""So many years that we were there and we were paying all this money for electricity, water, municipality fees, real property tax, other taxes, transfers, contracts, everything, we were not illegal. We were good, because we were paying the state. It is time the state paid for us,"" Antonis Petridis, member of the coordinating committee of Kineta residents told Xinhua. ""We are hearing only words, but they should turn them into actions. There are fire-stricken people today who are homeless and are sleeping once here, the next time elsewhere. They are being fed at soup kitchens. This must end. They should give a solution,"" he said. ""We have been abandoned at the mercy of God. After the fire, floods came and all homes flooded, they were all damaged, including those which had not been affected by the fire,"" Lefteris Papatheodorou, another Kineta resident, told Xinhua. ""Only a few things have been done, not so much, according to what they had pledged. We are still in the pledges stage. Nothing has materialized. Mati is like a cemetery. It was a paradise. We ask that people return to their homes,"" said Vassilis Vrettos who was wearing a black t-shirt with the date that changed dramatically their lives printed on. Vrettos did not lose his home, but he grieves for friends and neighbors who perished in the fire. All residents are in pain, regardless of losses, he said. Panagiota Vlachea, lost two family homes in Mati and is living on the rent, waiting for a license to start over again. ""They do make some steps, but 10 months have passed and we still don't even have licenses. We want to see our homes rebuilt. It is simple. That's it. We are not asking much, only the fundamental,"" she told Xinhua. ""Ten months later we are living in a bombarded city. Why? Nothing has been done. Why? I am a resident of Mati living in a bombarded city and I demand a change tomorrow. That's all,"" Varvara Kasselouri said. In a press statement issued following a meeting between a delegation of protesters and Environment Minister George Stathakis, it was pledged that the procedures for the issuance of licenses and reconstruction projects will accelerate. "	CCTV

Below is the full text:

Comrades, friends, ladies and gentlemen,  The year 2020 is arriving. From China's capital Beijing, I would like to extend my New Year wishes to you all!  In 2019, we sweated and we toiled as we pressed ahead with concrete efforts for achievements. Thanks to our steady pursuit of high-quality development, China's GDP is expected to edge close to 100 trillion yuan with the per capita figure reaching the level of 10,000 U.S. dollars. Significant breakthroughs have been achieved in three tough battles.  Coordinated development in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, the Yangtze River Economic Belt, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and the Yangtze River Delta, all accelerated. Ecological protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River basin have become national strategies. About 340 impoverished counties and more than 10 million people have been lifted out of poverty. Our lunar probe Chang'e-4, for the first time in human history, landed on the far side of the moon; the Long March-5 Y3 rocket was successfully launched; the Xuelong 2 icebreaker set sail on its maiden voyage to the Antarctic; the construction of the global network of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System is sprinting towards the finish line; the commercial application of 5G technology is accelerating; the Beijing Daxing International Airport ""phoenix spread its wings""… all these achievements are the result of the efforts and sweat of those who strive in the new era, and they demonstrate extraordinary Chinese splendor and Chinese strength. Over the past year, reform and opening-up has continuously generated vigor for development. The reform of Party and government institutions has been successfully completed. We have set up another batch of pilot free trade zones, and expanded the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone. The Science and Technology Innovation Board was launched smoothly. We have cut taxes and fees by more than 2 trillion yuan, and raised the individual income tax threshold. Many types of commonly-used medicines have seen their prices drop, while cheaper and faster internet connection has enabled faster flow of information. Garbage sorting is leading the new trend of a low-carbon lifestyle. This year we have also streamlined the work of officials at the grassroots level. New changes are taking place everywhere and the country is taking on a fresh look. Over the past year, we have steadily pushed forward reforms in our national defense and military systems. The armed forces have taken on a new look of a strong army in the new era. We held a grand military parade on National Day, celebrated the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the Navy and the Air Force, and also hosted the 7th Military World Games. The country's first self-developed aircraft carrier was commissioned. The people's army will always serve as a great wall of steel that guards our motherland. Let's salute those loyal soldiers who safeguard our home.  The most memorable moment of 2019 was the celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. We cheered for the glorious achievements the People’s Republic has made over the past 70 years, and were overwhelmed by the sheer force of patriotism. The formations during the military parade were powerful, and the mass pageant thrilling. Tiananmen Square was turned into a sea of happiness. All of China was arrayed in red with proud smiles on all faces as the song ""My Motherland and I"" played throughout the streets and alleys. Patriotic feelings brought tears to our eyes, and patriotic spirit forms the backbone of the Chinese nation. All these merge into a surging current that sings an ode to New China and inspires us to work harder in the new era, filling us with boundless energy.  Over the past year, I have visited many places. Construction of Xiong'an New Area is progressing, Tianjin Port is booming, Beijing's sub-center is thriving, grasslands in Inner Mongolia are splendid, the Hexi Corridor, after thousands of years, is teeming with new life. The winding Yellow River, where the sky is high and waters are wide, sometimes turbulent, sometimes calm; on both banks of the Huangpu River, there is plenty and prosperity, and ribbons of light shine in the night.  Everything is flourishing across our motherland. I traced the routes of China's revolution to strengthen my original aspiration. From Yudu in Jiangxi Province where the Red Army gathered for their Long March, to the Revolution Museum in Xinxian County in Henan Province, the former capital of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui revolutionary base, from the Monument to the West Route Army in Gaotai, Gansu Province, to the revolutionary memorial site in the Fragrant Hills in Beijing, all these places aroused many feelings and thoughts in my mind. Our original aspiration and mission are our inexhaustible source of motivation during our Long March of the new era. As usual, no matter how busy I was, I spent time visiting people in the countryside. People shared many of their innermost thoughts with me, and I always keep them in mind. I have also received letters from villagers of the Dulong ethnic group in Gongshan, Yunnan Province; residents of Xiadang township, Shouning County in Fujian Province; soldiers of the Wang Jie Squad; the graduate students of the Class of Champions at Beijing Sport University; and children and senior volunteers from Macao. In my reply letters, I applauded the achievements they had made and sent my best wishes.  Over the past year, many people and their stories touched us deeply. Zhang Fuqing has kept a low profile and stayed true to his original heart despite the great contributions he's made to the nation; Huang Wenxiu dedicated her youth and life to poverty alleviation; 31 fire fighters sacrificed their lives in the line of duty in Muli, Sichuan Province; Du Fuguo sacrificed himself to protect his teammates; and China's Women's National Volleyball Team won the World Cup in an eleven-match winning streak. Numerous unsung heroes, with neither complaint nor regret, with dedication. Ordinary people living extraordinary lives. In the year of 2019, China continued to open its arms wide to embrace the world. We hosted the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, the Beijing International Horticultural Exhibition, the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations, and the second China International Import Expo, showcasing a civilized, open and inclusive China to the rest of the world. I held meetings with many heads of state and government, sharing with them China's proposals, promoting friendship and deepening consensus. A few countries joined hands with us. The number of countries that have diplomatic ties with China now stands at 180. We have friends in every corner of the world.  2020 will be a year of milestone significance. We will finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and realize the first centenary goal. 2020 will also be a year of decisive victory for the elimination of poverty.  The bugle has sounded. We shall all of one heart ""add oil."" The greater the difficulties, the further we advance, strengthening our weak links even more and laying a more solid foundation to win the hard battle against poverty with determination, to lift all impoverished rural residents and counties out of poverty by current standards as scheduled. Several days ago, I attended the celebrations marking the 20th anniversary of Macao's return to the motherland and felt heartened for the prosperity and stability in Macao. The successful practice of Macao indicates that the principle of ""One Country, Two Systems"" is fully applicable, achievable, and popular. In recent months, our hearts have been concerned about the situation in Hong Kong. Without a harmonious and stable environment, how can people live in peace and enjoy their work! I sincerely wish Hong Kong well and our Hong Kong compatriots well. Hong Kong's prosperity and stability is the wish of Hong Kong compatriots and the expectation of people of our motherland.   Human history, like a river, runs forever, witnessing both peaceful moments and great disturbances. We are not afraid of storms and dangers and barriers. China is determined to walk along the road of peaceful development and will resolutely safeguard world peace and promote common development. We are willing to join hands with people of all countries in the world to build together the Belt and Road Initiative, and push forward the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, and make unremitting efforts for the creation of a beautiful future for mankind. At this moment, many people are still at their posts, many people are safeguarding peace and security, and many people are working tirelessly. Your hard work is greatly appreciated.  Let's seize the day and live it to the full, and greet the arrival of the year 2020 together. I wish you all a happy new year!

Han Dayuan, a professor of law at the Beijing-based Renmin University of China, said at a press conference held by the State Council Information Office Thursday that law-based governance of Hong Kong should safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and protect the rights and freedom of Hong Kong residents as enshrined in the Basic Law.
Noting that the rule of law in Hong Kong is facing various challenges, he stressed that the rule of law has the strength to resolve all disputes, bridge differences and regain consensus so that order and security can be restored as soon as possible.
Recently, the violent acts of radical protestors have severely violated multiple laws in Hong Kong, said Zou Pingxue, director of the Center for Basic Laws of Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions of Shenzhen University.
Zou called on Hong Kong residents, students' parents and educators to oppose and resist with a clear stand against any actions that aim to incite and instigate young students to take part in illegal activities.
Many countries, including the United States, consider extremist, violent acts as acts of terrorism, said Zhang Jian with the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies.
To curb the tendency of resorting to terrorism, the public ought to show zero tolerance towards violence, said Zhang, adding that the effort also requires strict law enforcement by the police and judicial authorities.
As for foreign interference in Hong Kong affairs, Zhao Kejin, deputy dean of the School of Social Sciences at the Beijing-based Tsinghua University, said Hong Kong-related issues have a profound international background.
After the return of Hong Kong, the United States has become even more blatant in interfering in Hong Kong affairs rather than changing its Hong Kong policies developed during the Cold War, which is one of the root causes of Hong Kong's chaotic situation, Zhao said.
Foreign forces should give up their colonial and Cold War mentality, and stop attempting to use Hong Kong to contain China's development, he added.  BEIJING, Aug. 15 -- In the face of serious violence, the only way to resolve the problem in Hong Kong is to return to the framework of the rule of law, a mainland legal expert said Thursday.

In an op-ed published by the U.S. magazine, Cui said some commentators have gone so far as to question the efficacy and even legitimacy of the principle. Therefore, clarification on misperception about the policy ""is still needed,"" he said.
The system practiced in Hong Kong, though different from that of the mainland, is something implemented for a certain administrative region of China in a certain historical stage, Cui wrote.
""It is still a Chinese system, not a duplicate of that of America or Europe,"" he stressed. ""Imposing a different, foreign system on Hong Kong is not only a challenge to the principle of ""one country"", but also harmful to the practice of ""two systems.""

Chief Executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam delivers a speech at a reception held by the Hong Kong Chinese Importers' and Exporters' Association to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in south China's Hong Kong, Sept. 16, 2019.

HONG KONG, Sept. 16 -- Chief Executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam said on Monday Hong Kong will certainly overcome the current difficulties after the HKSAR government reaches out to start sincere dialogues with the communities, with the understanding of the society and the support of the central government.
Speaking at a reception held by the Hong Kong Chinese Importers' and Exporters' Association to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Lam said Hong Kong is now bracing for internal and external problems.
The HKSAR government has announced new financing support for the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to help them fend off downside economic risks, including wider loan guarantee coverage and more subsidies to two funds for SMEs, Lam said.
Hong Kong's imports and exports, the transport and logistics sectors and related industries are under pressure due to the trade friction between China and the United States, Lam noted.
Escalating violence over the past months further dimmed the economic outlook and brought greater economic downside risks, as prolonged unrest has had a negative impact on the eocnomy and the people's livelihood, particularly on the external trade, tourism and retail sectors, she said.
""The HKSAR government is very concerned about the pressure on SMEs and the public in a weak economic environment.""
After more than 40 years of reform and opening-up, the country has made great progress in economic and social development and improving people's livelihood, Lam noted, adding Hong Kong has always played a role in connecting the mainland with other countries around the world.
Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the HKSAR has been greatly supported and trusted by the central government, Lam said, adding Hong Kong will continue to seize the opportunity to actively participate in the promotion of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Belt and Road Initiative.
By integrating into the development of the Greater Bay Area, Hong Kong will strengthen its role as a global offshore Renminbi business hub and international asset and risk management center and further enhance its status as an international financial center by developing services concerning innovative science and international legal and dispute settlement, she said.

Speaking at the launch of a three-day gala in Victoria Park that features high-tech and innovations－the largest celebration event happening in the city－Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government wants to promote innovation and technology.
It has invested more than HK$100 billion ($12.8 billion) in innovation and technology, Cheung said.
Apart from offering hands-on experiences with gadgets, the gala features music concerts, trendy culture, a food festival and a special area for young people to showcase their creative ideas.
The fiesta, which started on Saturday, had attracted more than 60,000 visitors up to Sunday afternoon. It was one of some 360 celebrations held by the Hong Kong Celebrations Association, which is made up of 40 social groups from various sectors.
The association estimated that more than 300,000 Hong Kong people would take part in them.
Brave Chan Yung, the association's acting executive chairman, said the festival aims to build a technology-friendly environment in Hong Kong, boost the city's science and technology development and provide a broad platform for Hong Kong youngsters.
People of all ages were seen snaking through the venue, event by event and booth by booth, to try out advanced high-tech products featuring virtual reality, 5G telecommunications and artificial intelligence.
Hong Kong resident Tsang Ka-hei, 22, was amazed by a mind-controlled robot invented by Logistics and Supply Chain MultiTech R&D Centre.
Tsang, who had a go at controlling the robot, was awed by the advanced product and said he enjoyed the experience, adding that he had never seen such a device before.
In addition to the high-tech exhibition and food booths, music concerts by international and local pop singers are also being staged in the park every night during the festival.
This year also marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which Chan said would attract more people to spread the festivities throughout the city.
The array of celebrations will also broaden and deepen Hong Kong resident's knowledge about the nation, Cheung said on Sunday.
With the dual advantages given under ""one country, two systems"", Cheung said, Hong Kong has made great contributions to the country's development, while the nation's prosperity has brought benefits to the SAR.
Also attending the ceremony, He Jing, deputy director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, said that a powerful nation will provide more opportunities for Hong Kong.
Apart from the celebrations held by social groups, many citizens opted for other places to celebrate the return of the city to the motherland－the three barracks of the People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison in Shek Kong, San Wai and Ngong Shuen Chau. The barracks are expected to receive some 30,000 Hong Kong residents during the three-day open day event.
Visitors to the barracks can see combat performances and military demonstrations, as well as weapons and military equipment including armored scout cars and helicopters.
Unlike the two other barracks, Ngong Shuen Chau－the PLA's naval base in Hong Kong－opened to the public on Sunday. High school student Zhong Yaoyu felt excited to be stepping into the barracks for the first time.
""The soldiers are friendly and I am proud of the country,"" Zhong said.

After graduating from university, Cai started his own company Discover Macao, an online tourist platform which provides 1,700 travel programs.

People visit the Ruins of St. Paul's complex in Macao, south China, Dec. 12, 2019. (Xinhua/Cheong Kam Ka)
About 62 percent of the users are people residing in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area city cluster.
Cai is one of a growing number of young people who live and work between Macao and the mainland and have witnessed the robust shared development between the two.
STRONG SUPPORT
Macao has enjoyed strong support from the mainland since its return to the motherland in 1999. The Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) was established and the region has been thriving under the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
Every morning, trucks loaded with fresh produce run through Zhuhai's Gongbei Border Checkpoint to markets in Macao.
The mainland also provides 88 percent of Macao's power supply and 98 percent of its water supply.
On top of material support, the mainland has issued a series of policies and measures over the years to boost the development of Macao.
In 2003, the mainland and Macao signed the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement. That same year, mainland residents were allowed to visit Macao under the Individual Visit Scheme.
In 2009, the central government approved a plan to build Hengqin in Guangdong Province into a model for cooperation.
In 2014, a new campus of the University of Macao was opened in Hengqin, enabling the university to raise its enrollment to about 10,000 at present.
In 2018, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge opened to traffic.
In February, the outline development plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) was unveiled, designating Macao as one of the four core cities in the region.
A new raft of policies was announced in November to make it easier for Macao residents to live, study and work in the bay area, as well as strengthen personnel, material and financial exchanges.
With the support, Macao has achieved rapid development over the past 20 years with its gross domestic product rising to 444.7 billion patacas (about 55 billion U.S. dollars) in 2018 from 51.9 billion patacas at its return to the motherland.
""The past 20 years has witnessed the fastest and greatest development in Macao's history, with macroeconomic indicators showing brilliant performance,"" said Fu Ziying, director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao SAR, adding that he believed the GBA will bring Macao even greater opportunities.
A survey by the General Association of Chinese Students of Macao in 2019 found that Macao youths are more optimistic about education and career prospects in the GBA. About 46 percent and 43.3 percent of the respondents are interested in study or work in bay area cities other than Macao respectively.
Chief Executive of the Macao SAR Chui Sai On said the confidence of Macao residents comes primarily from the country's strong support for Macao.
SENSE OF BELONGING
Ordinary residents stand to gain from Macao's rapid development. The per capita GDP of the region reached about 83,000 U.S. dollars in 2018.
The unemployment rate remained steady at 1.8 percent, according to the latest official statistics.
Life expectancy has reached 84 years, among the highest in the world.
The growing sense of gain nurtures a stronger sense of belonging, but even more important is the success of patriotic education. The core values of ""loving the country and Macao"" are taking root.
Schemes and programs were developed to encourage Macao students to learn about Chinese history, cultural traditions and laws to gain a deeper understanding of their country.
Many schools use textbooks published through collaborations between mainland and Macao institutions. At all levels of education in Macao, from primary schools to colleges and universities, the national flag flies high.
More Macao students have enrolled in mainland universities and colleges. In 2019 alone, 30.9 percent of Macao's high school graduates chose to pursue higher education on the mainland.
""Studying on the mainland, our students can even better witness the development of the motherland,"" said Kou Kam Fai, principal of Pui Ching Middle School.
GIVING BACK
Paulina Pereira Che, who grew up in a Chinese-Portuguese family, witnessed Macao's transformation from a small city to a world leisure center after its return to the motherland.
She is now a senior manager of an international resort and hospitality enterprise in Macao in charge of meetings and exhibitions.
""At the beginning, we only hosted small meetings with 50 attendants. Now the number is in the thousands for a single event,"" she said.
With the idea of giving back in mind, she helped a girl from a poor family in Congjiang, Guizhou Province continue her education. Her contribution is part of a collective effort.
Macao has been a partner of Congjiang in poverty alleviation since 2018. The Macao SAR government has provided financial and material assistance to the county, and particularly helped train local teachers.
Macao also has rich experience in community service and elderly care.
The General Union of Macao Residents Associations is cooperating with counterparts in Guangdong to improve their community and senior care service for mainland residents.
Macao is also playing unique roles as a platform for commercial and trade cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries and a key city along the Maritime Silk Road under the Belt and Road Initiative.
The Forum for Economic and Trade Co-operation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries was established in Macao in 2003. Five ministerial meetings under the framework have been held.
Macao, in the meantime, is actively diversifying its economy to develop its conference and exhibition industry, financial industry, traditional Chinese medicine industry and cultural and creative industry.
It is emerging as a world center of tourism and leisure, receiving 35.8 million visitors in 2018, a leap from fewer than 8 million in 1999.
""As of today, the basic structure of a moderately diversified economy has taken shape in Macao,"" said Leong Vai Tac, secretary for economy and finance of Macao.
""We hope the central government and various departments will continue their support for Macao,"" said Ho Iat Seng, incoming chief executive of the Macao SAR. ""Macao will also strive to make bigger contributions to the country's development.""

In 2003, the mainland and Macao signed the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement. That same year, mainland residents were allowed to visit Macao under the Individual Visit Scheme. In 2009, the central government approved a plan to build Hengqin in Guangdong Province into a model for cooperation. In 2014, a new campus of the University of Macao was opened in Hengqin, enabling the university to raise its enrollment to about 10,000 at present. In 2018, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge opened to traffic. In February, the outline development plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) was unveiled, designating Macao as one of the four core cities in the region. A new raft of policies was announced in November to make it easier for Macao residents to live, study and work in the bay area, as well as strengthen personnel, material and financial exchanges. With the support, Macao has achieved rapid development over the past 20 years with its gross domestic product rising to 444.7 billion patacas (about 55 billion U.S. dollars) in 2018 from 51.9 billion patacas at its return to the motherland. ""The past 20 years has witnessed the fastest and greatest development in Macao's history, with macroeconomic indicators showing brilliant performance,"" said Fu Ziying, director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao SAR, adding that he believed the GBA will bring Macao even greater opportunities. A survey by the General Association of Chinese Students of Macao in 2019 found that Macao youths are more optimistic about education and career prospects in the GBA. About 46 percent and 43.3 percent of the respondents are interested in study or work in bay area cities other than Macao respectively. Chief Executive of the Macao SAR Chui Sai On said the confidence of Macao residents comes primarily from the country's strong support for Macao. SENSE OF BELONGING Ordinary residents stand to gain from Macao's rapid development. The per capita GDP of the region reached about 83,000 U.S. dollars in 2018. The unemployment rate remained steady at 1.8 percent, according to the latest official statistics. Life expectancy has reached 84 years, among the highest in the world. The growing sense of gain nurtures a stronger sense of belonging, but even more important is the success of patriotic education. The core values of ""loving the country and Macao"" are taking root. Schemes and programs were developed to encourage Macao students to learn about Chinese history, cultural traditions and laws to gain a deeper understanding of their country. Many schools use textbooks published through collaborations between mainland and Macao institutions. At all levels of education in Macao, from primary schools to colleges and universities, the national flag flies high. More Macao students have enrolled in mainland universities and colleges. In 2019 alone, 30.9 percent of Macao's high school graduates chose to pursue higher education on the mainland. ""Studying on the mainland, our students can even better witness the development of the motherland,"" said Kou Kam Fai, principal of Pui Ching Middle School. GIVING BACK Paulina Pereira Che, who grew up in a Chinese-Portuguese family, witnessed Macao's transformation from a small city to a world leisure center after its return to the motherland. She is now a senior manager of an international resort and hospitality enterprise in Macao in charge of meetings and exhibitions. ""At the beginning, we only hosted small meetings with 50 attendants. Now the number is in the thousands for a single event,"" she said. With the idea of giving back in mind, she helped a girl from a poor family in Congjiang, Guizhou Province continue her education. Her contribution is part of a collective effort. Macao has been a partner of Congjiang in poverty alleviation since 2018. The Macao SAR government has provided financial and material assistance to the county, and particularly helped train local teachers. Macao also has rich experience in community service and elderly care. The General Union of Macao Residents Associations is cooperating with counterparts in Guangdong to improve their community and senior care service for mainland residents. Macao is also playing unique roles as a platform for commercial and trade cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries and a key city along the Maritime Silk Road under the Belt and Road Initiative. The Forum for Economic and Trade Co-operation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries was established in Macao in 2003. Five ministerial meetings under the framework have been held. Macao, in the meantime, is actively diversifying its economy to develop its conference and exhibition industry, financial industry, traditional Chinese medicine industry and cultural and creative industry. It is emerging as a world center of tourism and leisure, receiving 35.8 million visitors in 2018, a leap from fewer than 8 million in 1999. ""As of today, the basic structure of a moderately diversified economy has taken shape in Macao,"" said Leong Vai Tac, secretary for economy and finance of Macao. ""We hope the central government and various departments will continue their support for Macao,"" said Ho Iat Seng, incoming chief executive of the Macao SAR. ""Macao will also strive to make bigger contributions to the country's development."""	CCTV

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver speaks during a welcome reception for the NBA Japan Games 2019 between the Toronto Raptors and the Houston Rockets in Tokyo, Japan, Monday, Oct. 7, 2019.
The recent remarks made on Twitter by the general manager of the Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey, in support of the violent riots in Hong Kong triggered a huge row in China. The situation worsened when NBA Commissioner Adam Silver defended the remarks by claiming Morey was just exercising his ""freedom of expression"". But freedom of speech is not absolute: it does not include speech that challenges China's national sovereignty and social stability, and the argument provided by Morey and Silver reflects their contempt for the Chinese people.
When addressing Morey's controversial tweet in Tokyo, Silver said ""Values of equality, respect, and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA."" But equality and respect should be reciprocal, and so far Morey hasn't shown respect for China's sovereignty and national dignity in his remarks on Hong Kong, and Silver failed to act in the spirit of equality by attempting to shield his NBA colleague from criticism.
Silver has also adopted a double standard when it comes to freedom of speech. The NBA commissioner said the league ""will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees, and team owners say or will not say."" But when the former owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, Donald Sterling, made racist remarks during an argument with his girlfriend in 2014, Sterling was banned for life from the NBA, fined 2.5 million U.S. dollars, and forced to sell the team. Silver himself announced the NBA's decision on the matter. But when it comes to an abuse of China's sovereignty, Silver has chosen to adopt another standard for freedom of speech.
As the first American sports league to tap into China's market, the NBA has enjoyed great success in China over the past three decades. It's also become a bridge for communication between the people in the two countries. But those ties are now at risk, as the league's local partners, including China Media Group's CCTV Sports channel and Tencent, suspend their cooperation with the NBA.
Rome was not built in a day, but it burned in one. If the NBA wants to repair its damaged relationship with China and its legions of basketball fans, it should reflect on the disrespect it has shown towards the country's sovereignty. As China's foreign ministry spokesperson pointed out on Tuesday, ""Lacking knowledge of the minds and hearts of the Chinese people while trying to build communication and cooperation won't work.""

Scenery of Macao Peninsula in south China, Nov. 18, 2019. (Xinhua/Cheong Kam Ka)
Containers were piled like mountains at the Ka Ho Harbour and large crowds of travelers were crossing the Gongbei Port linking Macao with the mainland.
Three cross-sea bridges connecting different parts of Macao, and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, the world's longest cross-sea bridge, stretched across the sea surface like four beautiful ribbons.
Looking out, Macao's modern high-rise skyline merged into the prosperous world-class city cluster of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.
Macao is ready to host a grand celebration on Friday to mark the 20th anniversary of its return to the motherland.
During the past 20 years, the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), once burdened with a floundering economy and notoriously poor security, has experienced profound changes to become a flourishing international free port with its per capita GDP and life expectancy among the highest in the world.
Macao's transformation has demonstrated to the world a successful practice of ""one country, two systems,"" a fundamental national policy formulated and continuously improved by Chinese leaders to resolve sovereignty-related questions arising from the nation's complicated past.
SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE OF ""ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS""
On Dec. 20, 1999, standing under the regional and national flags, 44-year-old Ho Hau Wah was sworn in as the first chief executive of the Macao SAR.
""I made two promises: one was to implement the Basic Law without compromise to make 'one country, two systems' a success in Macao; the other was to try my best to deliver a Macao where people could live and work in peace and contentment,"" Ho, now vice chairman of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, told Xinhua in a recent interview.
""Macao residents of all ages have a full and accurate understanding of the Basic Law and the Constitution. This has led to the smooth implementation of the 'one country, two systems' with Macao characteristics,"" he said.
Macao has enjoyed a long tradition of loyalty to the motherland even before its return in 1999. Since then, the tradition has been maintained and enhanced at different levels of government and within society, with the Constitution and the Basic Law advocated by all people, incumbent Chief Executive of the Macao SAR Chui Sai On told Xinhua.
One key to Macao's successful practice of ""one country, two systems"" is that the Macao SAR has well implemented the requirements by the central government, said incoming Chief Executive Ho Iat Seng, who will be sworn in as the fifth-term chief executive Friday on the anniversary day.
GREATER PROSPERITY, STABILITY
Twenty years have flown by since Macao's return to the motherland, during which it drew international attention with its tremendous development.
Macao's gross domestic product soared to 54.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 from 6.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1999, with its financial reserves and foreign exchange reserves growing exponentially.
Employment now is almost full and the government has done its utmost to promote a strong social welfare system including public security, housing, education, medical care, job training and disaster prevention. Macao residents enjoy a stronger sense of happiness and gain.
""Macao residents' happiness index is high,"" said Fu Ziying, director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao SAR, citing various social welfare benefits provided by the SAR government.
Macao people aged 65 and above receive a combined allowance of up to 6,099 Macao patacas (about 760 U.S. dollars) every month, he said.
All students enjoy free education for 15 years. Since 2007, the SAR government has been distributing year-end bonuses of up to 10,000 Macao patacas to all residents.
To promote economic growth, Macao has in recent years been striving to diversify its economy while taking on new roles as an international tourism and leisure center, a platform for trade cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries and an active participant of the Belt and Road Initiative, among others.
In the outline development plan of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area unveiled earlier this year by the central government, Macao is listed as one of the four core cities in the area to serve as one of the core engines for regional development.
These moves fully demonstrated the central government's strong support for Macao to integrate into the overall development of the country, and will greatly promote the infrastructure connectivity and smooth flow of personnel and goods between Macao and the mainland, Ho Iat Seng said.
""We hope the central government and all departments will continue to provide help to Macao. Macao will also try its best to make greater contributions to the overall development of the country,"" said Ho.
The Macao SAR has also made impressive achievements in its external exchanges, bringing the number of international organizations it has joined to 120 from 51 before its return, Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Macao SAR Shen Beili told Xinhua.
DEEP-ROOTED PATRIOTISM
All Macao residents have a clear understanding that Macao is backed by a strong motherland and the support of 1.4 billion compatriots, according to Ho Hau Wah.
Patriotic education is deep-rooted in schools, youth societies and government agencies, which has helped pass the torch of patriotic tradition from one generation to the next, he said.
Macao residents consciously align their own fate with that of the motherland, seeking their development opportunities within the overall development plan of the country.
He acknowledged that there were times when people differed with the government. ""But Macao residents have never wavered in their confidence in 'one country, two systems,' and their feelings for the motherland have never weakened,"" Ho said.
Macao's success can be seen in its harmony and inclusiveness, where loving both the motherland and Macao has become a mainstream value, according to Fu Ziying.
Fu said the Macao SAR government has attached great importance to cultivating patriotism among the youth. The national flag is hoisted in all educational institutions and various patriotic education activities are held regularly.
A great number of cultural exchange activities between the mainland and Macao, especially among teachers and students, have boosted mutual understanding. Since 2016, more than 3,000 Macao students have toured the mainland under a Macao SAR government-sponsored plan.
""I will continue to unite all members of society to push forward 'one country, two systems' and build a more prosperous and beautiful Macao,"" Ho Iat Seng said.

Accompanied by French President Emmanuel Macron, Xi visited the French exhibition area and tasted French wine and beef. French entrepreneurs said they are bullish about the Chinese market and hope to further expand exports to China.
Xi said he hopes French entrepreneurs can take a long-term view and strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation with China.
Chinese and foreign leaders also visited the exhibition areas of Tanzania, Greece, Italy, Jamaica, Indonesia and Russia.

He said that debate, discussion and dissent were essential parts of democracy ""but never had damage to public property and disturbance of normal life been a part of our ethos.""  ""I want to unequivocally assure my fellow Indians that CAA does not affect any citizen of India of any religion. No Indian has anything to worry regarding this Act. This Act is only for those who have faced years of persecution outside and have no other place to go except India,"" tweeted the Indian prime minister.  Violence in New Delhi Indian police fired tear gas and resorted to baton charges to disperse thousands of violent demonstrators who were torching vehicles in New Delhi on Sunday, as protests against the CAA continued for a fifth straight day across the country. The new law allows non-Muslim migrants from the neighboring Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, who entered India illegally, to become citizens. Enacted on December 11, the act has stirred protests across India, but the eastern part of the country, where resentment toward Bangladeshi immigrants has persisted for decades, has been among the worst hit. Violent demonstrations in the Indian capital have been on since Friday. Modi's government says the new law will save religious minorities such as Hindus and Christians from persecution in Muslim-majority neighboring countries by offering them a path to Indian citizenship. But critics say the law, which does not make the same provision for Muslims, is part of the government's agenda to marginalize Muslims and weakens India's secular principles enshrined in the constitution, which recognizes and accepts all religions.  On Sunday, protesters in South Delhi, including locals and some students, torched some buses, cars and two wheelers, while police resorted to baton charges and firing tear gas on the protesters to disperse them. ""About 4,000 people were protesting and police did what they did to disperse them when the crowd burned buses,"" said Chinmoy Biswal, a senior police officer in the area. ""If it had been a peaceful mob it would have been dispersed peacefully."" Police later in the evening stormed into the nearby Jamia Milia Islamia University campus where many protesters were believed to have fled and fired tear gas on the campus and marched some students out, while detaining others. Many students from the storied Muslim university have been protesting against the new law since Friday, when police first used tear gas to disperse protesters. Waseem Ahmed Khan, a senior faculty member of the university was quoted by ANI as saying that police have entered the campus on Sunday. ""Police have entered the campus by force, no permission was given. Our staff and students are being beaten up and forced to leave the campus."" Students at the nearly 100-year-old university took shelter in the library after police fired tear gas shells, said Tehreem Mirza, a student at the university. Police defended their move to storm the campus saying they only entered as they were being pelted with stones from within. ""We had no intention of entering the university campus, we only want to maintain peace and order,"" said Biswal. Protests against the bill continued in parts of eastern India. A highway connecting the states of West Bengal and Assam was blocked in several places on Sunday when protesters, demanding the law be scrapped, burned tires. Violence was also reported in the eastern state of Bihar. Internet services have been suspended in parts of West Bengal. State chief minister Mamata Banerjee in an address to the people urged for peace and warned that a ""section of people are trying to take advantage of the situation and incite communal disharmony."""

Beijing has never been involved in Taiwan elections, and resolutely opposes any words or deeds that discredit the Chinese mainland, said Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office.
She said that Beijing is concerned about the prospects of cross-Strait relations and Taiwan compatriots' interests and welfare. Policies such as ""31 measures"", mainland residence permits for Taiwan residents and ""26 measures"" have been introduced, based on the needs of Taiwan residents. Meanwhile, measures such as water supply from Fujian to Kinmen, bridging Taiwan businessmen with opportunities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the Yangtze River Delta regional integration, and the Belt and Road construction have been widely welcomed by Taiwan compatriots and enterprises.
On the other hand, in the past three years, the DPP authority has tried to divide Taiwan society and create cross-Strait hostility. They spared no efforts to prevent Taiwan's compatriots and enterprises from coming to the Chinese mainland for exchange and development. Taiwan's enterprises, retired officials and officers, teachers and students, the tourism industry and the media are suffering under their ""green terror,"" she said.
Raising confrontation and undermining cross-Strait relations is the tactics of the DPP authority in manipulating elections, Zhu added. The recent complicated and grim situation in the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan compatriots' distress and anxiety about the future are rooted in this.
Reversal of right and wrong
Zhu further said that Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen's comment on cross-Strait relations last Wednesday was completely wrong and misleading.
She said the DPP authority unilaterally denied the ""1992 Consensus"" and undermined cross-Strait relations, restrained cross-Strait economic and trade cooperation and harmed the vital interests of Taiwan compatriots and Taiwan's economic development.
She also reminded compatriots on both sides to be highly vigilant and not to be fooled.
Responding to a U.S. defense bill approved recently supporting U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, Zhu said the bill violates the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiqués, seriously damages China-U.S. relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.

Trump accused Iran of orchestrating demonstrations at the U.S. embassy in Iraq on Tuesday and said Tehran would be held responsible. Iran has rejected the accusation.  'Not leading to war' ""We are not leading the country to war, but we are not afraid of any war and we tell America to speak correctly with the Iranian nation. We have the power to break them several times over and are not worried,"" Revolutionary Guards Commander Brigadier General Hossein Salami was quoted by Tasnim as saying. Trump had said in a tweet on Tuesday that Iran would be ""held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat."" He later said he did not want or foresee a war with Iran. Iran's Army chief Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi said on Thursday his forces were ready to confront the ""enemy."" ""Our armed forces ... monitor all moves, and if anyone makes the slightest mistake, they will decisively react, and if the situation heats up, we will show our abilities to the enemy,"" Mousavi was quoted as saying by state broadcaster IRIB. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday condemned U.S. attacks on Iranian-allied militias in Iraq, blaming the United States for violence in Iran's neighbor. Iran protested on Wednesday to a Swiss envoy, who represents U.S. interests in the country, over what it called ""warmongering statements"" by American officials. Iraqi protesters leave U.S. embassy Following two days of violent protests, members and supporters of the Iranian-backed Hashd al-Shaabi reportedly withdrew from the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. The move came after group members hurled rocks, petrol bombs and smashed doors at the embassy compound on December 31 while U.S. forces stationed on the rooftops fired tear gas to disperse them. The groups dispersed after Washington dispatched extra U.S. troops and also threatened reprisals against Tehran. Iraq's military said that the area was completely secure and the U.S. government said they had no plans to evacuate the facility. The demonstrations broke out after the U.S. launched airstrikes against the Tehran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia group, killing 25 members on December 29. The U.S. said the ""precision defensive airstrikes"" were in response to a rocket attack that killed an American contractor on an Iraqi-military base."	CCTV

BEIJING, Oct. 9 -- Washington has been increasingly trigger-happy when it comes to interfering in China's internal affairs.
Following their recent flagrant interferences in China's Hong Kong, China hawks in Washington are making waves regarding Xinjiang. The U.S. Department of Commerce on Monday added some Chinese entities to its sanctions list. On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department announced visa restrictions on some Chinese officials.
For years, some politicians in Washington have been bent on weaving stories about Xinjiang, while turning a blind eye to the fact that China's policies in the area have achieved remarkable results in maintaining stability and prosperity in that region.
Quite different from what these politicians have been peddling around, the most urgent issue in Xinjiang is not about religion or human rights, but rather about combatting extremism and terrorism.
This is exactly what the Chinese government has been doing. By referring to the UN Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism, China has been taking effective measures to prevent extremism and terrorism at their root in Xinjiang, which are consistent with Chinese laws and common approaches adopted by other countries.
With these policies and measures, Xinjiang's social stability and security have been significantly improved, and it has not seen a single violent terrorist act in the past three years.
Washington's real motive behind these getting-tough-on-China moves has never been about human rights, but rather about hindering China's development while pretending to claim the high moral ground.
Washington's ban on these Chinese entities has also clearly exposed its hegemonic way of thinking. As the world's most powerful country, it always views itself as ""the world's policeman,"" trampling on the authority of international law and exercising long-arm jurisdiction with unilateral sanctions as it sees fit.
It is high time for those China hawks in Washington to stop interfering in China's domestic issues. And Beijing will take every necessary measure to safeguard its vital interests.

In a phone conversation with his U.S. counterpart, Donald Trump, Xi noted that the two countries have reached the phase-one agreement on the basis of the principle of equality and mutual respect.
Against the backdrop of an extremely complicated international environment, the agreement benefits China, the United States, as well as peace and prosperity of the whole world, Xi said.
For his part, Trump said that the phase-one economic and trade agreement reached between China and the United States is good for the two countries and the whole world.
Noting that both countries' markets and the world have responded very positively to the agreement, Trump said that the United States is willing to maintain close communication with China and strive for the signing and implementation of the agreement at an early date.
Xi stressed that the economic and trade cooperation between China and the United States has made significant contributions to the stability and development of China-U.S. relations and the advancement of the world economy.
Modern economy and modern technologies have integrated the world as a whole, thus making the interests of China and the United States more intertwined with each other, Xi said, adding that the two sides will experience some differences in cooperation.
As long as both sides keep holding the mainstream of China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation featuring mutual benefits and win-win outcomes, and always respect each other's national dignity, sovereignty and core interests, they will overcome difficulties on the way of progress, and push forward their economic and trade relations under the new historical conditions, so as to benefit the two countries and peoples, Xi said.
China expresses serious concerns over the U.S. side's recent negative words and actions on issues related to China's Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet, Xi said.
He noted that the U.S. behaviors have interfered in China's internal affairs and harmed China's interests, which is detrimental to the mutual trust and bilateral cooperation.
China hopes that the United States will seriously implement the important consensuses reached by the two leaders over various meetings and phone conversations, pay high attention and attach great importance to China's concerns, and prevent bilateral relations and important agendas from being disturbed, Xi said.
Trump said he is looking forward to maintaining regular communication with Xi by various means, adding he is confident that both countries can properly handle differences, and U.S.-China relations can maintain smooth development.
Xi said he is willing to maintain contacts with Trump by various means, exchange views over bilateral relations and international affairs, and jointly promote China-U.S. relations on the basis of coordination, cooperation and stability.
The two heads of state also exchanged views on the situation of the Korean Peninsula.

Modern economy and modern technologies have integrated the world as a whole, thus making the interests of China and the United States more intertwined with each other, Xi said, adding that the two sides will experience some differences in cooperation. As long as both sides keep holding the mainstream of China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation featuring mutual benefits and win-win outcomes, and always respect each other's national dignity, sovereignty and core interests, they will overcome difficulties on the way of progress, and push forward their economic and trade relations under the new historical conditions, so as to benefit the two countries and peoples, Xi said. China expresses serious concerns over the U.S. side's recent negative words and actions on issues related to China's Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet, Xi said. He noted that the U.S. behaviors have interfered in China's internal affairs and harmed China's interests, which is detrimental to the mutual trust and bilateral cooperation. China hopes that the United States will seriously implement the important consensuses reached by the two leaders over various meetings and phone conversations, pay high attention and attach great importance to China's concerns, and prevent bilateral relations and important agendas from being disturbed, Xi said. Trump said he is looking forward to maintaining regular communication with Xi by various means, adding he is confident that both countries can properly handle differences, and U.S.-China relations can maintain smooth development. Xi said he is willing to maintain contacts with Trump by various means, exchange views over bilateral relations and international affairs, and jointly promote China-U.S. relations on the basis of coordination, cooperation and stability. The two heads of state also exchanged views on the situation of the Korean Peninsula. Xi stressed that it is imperative to stick to the general direction of a political settlement, saying all parties should meet each other halfway, and maintain dialogue and momentum for the mitigation of the situation, which is in the common interests of all. "	CCTV

""These elements had received CIA-funded training in various countries under the cover of becoming citizen-journalists,"" the Intelligence Ministry told IRNA. Among them, ""six were arrested while attending the riots and carrying out (CIA) orders and two while trying to... send information abroad,"" said ministry authorities. The unrest, which began in October, soon lost control with banks, petrol pumps and police stations vandalized in some areas by protesters. Iranian officials have so far confirmed five fatalities and around 500 arrests, while some organizations gave largely different numbers indicating more deaths. Upon the end of the fuel protest, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that the violent turnout following the oil price hike was a plot set by the United States. ""The people foiled a deep, vast and very dangerous conspiracy on which a lot of money was spent for destruction, viciousness and the killing of people,"" said Khamenei on the state TV. Condemning the U.S. interference in the unrest and showing support for the Iranian government, large numbers of Iranians across the country went on the street holding slogans and images of their leaders on Wednesday. It was not the first time that the ministry claimed that they identified CIA affiliated spies in the nation. Back in July, the agency said that they had arrested in total 17 by March 2019, the end of last Iranian calendar year. Some received death penalty and some were sentenced to long imprisonment. The head counter-intelligence official said that the spies were working for industries across fields including infrastructure, cyberspace and nuclear programs, while leaking vital information to the foreign enemy.

To enjoy the meal, parents often get up early to buy ingredients and spend hours cooking, while sons and daughters trek in the world’s largest annual human migration known as “Spring Festival Rush” from work or study back to hometowns.
Just like turkeys on Thanksgiving, some particular dishes are must-haves on Chinese New Year’s Eve dinner table. Even though regional customs vary widely in the vast country, following are five typical dishes for the reunion dinner. Foodies, hold your drool!
DUMPLINGS
Dumplings are the favorite of northern Chinese for many reasons. On the one hand, they’re tasty. On the other hand, they look like gold ingots. By eating them people wish more treasure will come in.
When making dumplings, many families use several particular kinds of vegetables to go with meat for the filling because the Chinese words for these vegetables sound similar to some auspicious phrases.
For example, cabbage sounds like “a hundred kinds of treasures.” Celery sounds like “diligence” and green onion “cleverness.”
In some places, people would randomly stuff things like coins or candies with the filling in some dumplings. Anyone who eats the dumpling with a coin in it is believed to make a fortune in the New Year. With a candy in it? Enjoy a sweet life!
FISH
Fish is essential for the reunion dinner menu because the Chinese word for fish, “yu,” is a homophone for “leftover” or “surplus.” The fish is even deliberately left over and stored overnight for the New Year’s Day in some places. People believe such a custom would bring them financial surplus every year.
There are various ways to cook a fish. Steamed fish is a classic Cantonese recipe. Sweet and sour fish is popular in Shanghai. Braised fish is a specialty in East China’s Jiangsu and Anhui provinces.
In southern China, the fish must be served as a whole. Turning the fish over on the plate is a taboo. People prefer to pull the flesh beneath the fish with chopsticks.
SOMETHING ROUND
Chinese like to eat round food because the Chinese word for “round” also means reunion. Two kinds of round food are typical recipes for the reunion dinner: meatballs and Tangyuan.
Pearl Meatballs is a classic dish in central China’s Hubei Province. Roll seasoned ground pork into balls, and then roll them in the soaked glutinous rice to coat completely. After steaming, the meatballs look like pearls and taste delicious but not greasy.
Tangyuan is a traditional Chinese dessert made from glutinous rice flour mixed with water to form balls and is cooked in boiling water. Sesame paste is the most common filling.
Another typical dessert for lunar New Year is Niangao, or New Year Cake. It is also made from glutinous rice and implies promotion and improvement year after year.
HOT POT
Hot pot is absolutely the best comfort in the cold weather during lunar New Year. It’s perhaps the most social way of dining as people gather around one table cooking and sharing the food in a shared pot.
People from different parts of China eat different hot pots. Lamb is a popular choice in colder northern China, while mouth-numbing and spicy broth is the key to hot pot in southwest China’s Sichuan and Chongqing.
CHICKEN
“No chicken, no feast.” That’s a saying in Hong Kong, Macao and south China’s Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan. To local folks, the best chicken recipe is Cantonese White-cut Chicken.
As the name suggests, the dish is a poached whole chicken, chopped up and served with minced ginger and scallions. But the secret to make a delicious white-cut chicken is to get a freshly killed chicken instead of a frozen one. And a cold bath for the chicken immediately after poaching makes the flesh firm and the skin crispy.
Wish you a yummy Chinese New Year! The most important celebration for Chinese lunar New Year is perhaps the reunion dinner on New Year’s Eve, when family members get together for good food.

Turning the fish over on the plate is a taboo. People prefer to pull the flesh beneath the fish with chopsticks. SOMETHING ROUND Chinese like to eat round food because the Chinese word for “round” also means reunion. Two kinds of round food are typical recipes for the reunion dinner: meatballs and Tangyuan. Pearl Meatballs is a classic dish in central China’s Hubei Province. Roll seasoned ground pork into balls, and then roll them in the soaked glutinous rice to coat completely. After steaming, the meatballs look like pearls and taste delicious but not greasy. Tangyuan is a traditional Chinese dessert made from glutinous rice flour mixed with water to form balls and is cooked in boiling water. Sesame paste is the most common filling. Another typical dessert for lunar New Year is Niangao, or New Year Cake. It is also made from glutinous rice and implies promotion and improvement year after year. HOT POT Hot pot is absolutely the best comfort in the cold weather during lunar New Year. It’s perhaps the most social way of dining as people gather around one table cooking and sharing the food in a shared pot. People from different parts of China eat different hot pots. Lamb is a popular choice in colder northern China, while mouth-numbing and spicy broth is the key to hot pot in southwest China’s Sichuan and Chongqing. CHICKEN “No chicken, no feast.” That’s a saying in Hong Kong, Macao and south China’s Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan. To local folks, the best chicken recipe is Cantonese White-cut Chicken. As the name suggests, the dish is a poached whole chicken, chopped up and served with minced ginger and scallions. But the secret to make a delicious white-cut chicken is to get a freshly killed chicken instead of a frozen one. And a cold bath for the chicken immediately after poaching makes the flesh firm and the skin crispy. Wish you a yummy Chinese New Year!"	CCTV

He also called on the two sides to strengthen communication and continue to step up coordination on major issues including climate change and marine affairs.

What do you want to say about the past decade and what are your expectations? In early January, 13 influential speakers told their personal stories and spoke about their expectations at the “From Strength to Strength－A Decade Ahead” event in Beijing. The speakers included: China’s first astronaut in space Yang Liwei, world championship Deng Yaping, Hong Kong film director Stanley Tong, young actor Shen Yue, the e-commerce live streaming host Viya and singer Jackson Yee. Below are speech excerpts from them. Yang Liwei, China’s first astronaut in space  Yang told his story of high-G centrifuge training, designed to prevent an acceleration-induced loss of consciousness. It is one of the trainings for astronauts who are part of the space program. “During the test, face was stretched to be deformed, tears run uncontrollably, but the astronaut’s operation doesn’t stop. Whenever he cannot withstand the pressure, he can press the alarm button in his hand, the test would then stop. But it hasn’t happened for the past 22 years since the founding of China’s first astronaut team in 1998.”  “If you wouldn’t live an astronaut’s life, you can’t experience the hardships behind, and you can not possess the joys of success after years of training. I am always prepared to be selected as an astronaut for the next space mission and to meet the challenges.” Deng Yaping, world table tennis championships  Deng Yaping won 18 world championships, including 4 Olympic championships. She loves table tennis and explained the secrets of her success. “Everyday, I practised an additional 40 minutes than others. Plus weekend, I practised 48 more days a year. Because of my extra efforts, I’d been much more confident when standing on the playing arena.”  “It is the passion and ardent love for an undertaking that gives you strength to withstand failures and pressures.” Chu Yin, professor from the University of International Relations  Chu Yin is known for his sharp tongue and humorous speech style. This time, he talked about how to expand China’s domestic demands. “Any social progress is accompanied by sacrifices and price, which brings opportunities, challenges and possibilities as well. In the past, residents in the first- and second-tier cities were major consumers and a large number of people were absent.”  “Now, people in rural areas, urban fringe and towns are the emerging consumption groups. Their presence fundamentally ensures the expansion of China’s domestic demands. We are in an era of inclusiveness. It requires us to adjust the commercial inertia we have gotten used to. The mass-age has arrived.” Hui Ruoqi, Chinese volleyball player  Hui Ruoqi, known as Rachel Hui, received great encouragement from Coach Lang Ping when she suffered from both psychological stress and physical pain. She thought of giving up, but finally, she kept going. She said, “If it is where your dream lies in, please try and make effort one more time to pursue your dream.”  “Chinese women’s volleyball team has experienced glories and setbacks, but the spirit of striving and forging ahead remains as always. I am proud to be a member of the team. The spirit and the pursuit of dream become our firm courage and momentum for setting out again when we passes our wins and everything returns to the very beginning. .” Ma Ding, TV host and founder of the Martian Club  Ma Ding’s mother is an obstetricians and gynecologist. During his childhood, he spent many Chinese New Year Eves with other doctors in the duty room at the hospital. He remembered clearly that from time to time, doctors were called away to handle emergencies. Now, he calls for more understanding and care for doctors and a rational way to view doctor’s career. “We should change our routine way of seeing the doctor and practise the hierarchical medical treatment system. For the common, simple health issues, please go to the grassroots hospital and not rush to major hospitals. Everyone will benefit from the system, particularly when we become a patient one day.”	CCTV

Defending a reform ""whose ambition is great, even immense,"" the newly-appointed Solidarity and Health Minister Olivier Veran argued that an universal system ""is the pillar of social protection."" ""Today is the time for responsibility towards the French through a discussion that will take the time it needs,"" he addressed the National Assembly. Challenging a taboo, the government has proposed a point-based pension system with same rules applying to all, regardless of profession or sector, to replace the current system of 42 regimes. It also plans to end a specific regime for workers of public transport companies RATP and SNCF, which allows train drivers and other staff who work underground to retire at 52 -- a decade earlier than the legal retirement age for a full public pension. Under the new system, every hour worked will earn pension rights, which will benefit gig economy workers who often do not earn enough to lock in pension rights under the current system. ""Our predecessors have carried out courageous reforms but always for budgetary reason ... Our reading is broader, our ambition exceeds the balanced budget. It is a social overhaul that the government is proposing,"" Laurent Pietraszewski, secretary of state for pension reform, told lawmakers. Willing to compromise on the disputed reform, the government has offered some concessions including a temporarily removal of ""pivotal age"" of 64, the most contested measure of the reform. It invited unionists to dig for another way to balance the pension deficit during a financing conference. Otherwise, the measure will be added back in before the bill is slated to be voted into law this summer. However, the sweeteners fell short to abate fierce opposition to President Emmanuel Macron's plan to overhaul pension regime. Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of ""France Unbowed"" party, pledged ""tough, relentless and long-lasting"" two-week debate at the National Assembly. ""We will do everything we can to prevent this law from being passed,"" he told local media. As the debate in the lower house of the parliament seemed to be heated, trade unions are still a long way from a deal with the government over the planned reform. Unions have planned countrywide protests on Feb. 20. During last two months, large crowds including teachers, civil servants, medical staff, drivers, police and even students had participated in seven separate days of nationwide demonstrations to pressure Macron to reconsider his reform. They say the reform would effectively force people to work longer, in particular public sector workers that have been allowed to retire earlier often because of hard working conditions. The government argued that the costly pension system, which is almost entirely borne by the state, needs to be brought into balance."	CCTV

A series of meetings has been held over the past few weeks, following a master plan of the integrated development of the region unveiled on Dec. 1 by China's top authorities, in a bid to speed up the region's opening up. The implementation of the plan is a major strategic measure to lead high-quality development and improve the planning of further reform and opening up, in a bid to build a strong and vibrant growth pole for development, said Luo Wen, vice head of the National Development and Reform Commission. The 358,000-square km expanse, about the same size as Germany, encompasses the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shanghai Municipality. It contributes about one-fourth of the country's GDP and one-third of foreign trade and investment. As a national strategy, the integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta region coordinates with the development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, as well as the Belt and Road Initiative, said Zhang Xueliang, a professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. ALL RIVERS RUN INTO THE SEA Located at the Yangtze estuary with criss-crossing rivers, the region, led by Shanghai, has witnessed its residents enjoy geographical proximity and cultural affinity, as well as long-term exchanges with the outside world for a long time. The Old Bund of Ningbo in Zhejiang was opened to trade in the 1840s, with immigrants from Britain, the United States, France and other countries settling there more than a century ago. Today, the Ningbo Zhoushan Port has become the largest port in the world in terms of cargo tonnage, linking the Yangtze River Economic Belt with the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. It handled over 1 billion tonnes of cargo in 2018. Less than 200 km southwest of Ningbo is the country's small commodity hub of Yiwu, home to 15,000 foreign merchants from over 100 countries. Dubbed as the ""World's Supermarket,"" it receives more than 550,000 overseas buyers and sells commodities to more than 210 countries and regions every year. Gopher Chocolate, a Zhejiang-based enterprise, is just about to open a store in the Shanghai Hongqiao World Center, the first in the city. At a local administrative approval service center in Zhejiang, Mo Xuefeng, general manager of Gopher Chocolate (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., received his business license, together with a license for food production and trading, both issued by market regulation authorities in Shanghai. ""With more relaxed administrative barriers, I saved a lot of legwork,"" Mo said. Foreign businesses also enjoyed the convenience brought by regional integration. Air Products, a U.S.-based industrial gases manufacturer rooted in the Yangtze River Delta region for more than two decades, is pleasantly surprised to find that governments within the region are competing with each other to improve the business environment and provide better administrative services. Feng Yan, vice president of the company's subsidiary in China, used to feel that each local government in the Yangtze River Delta had its own policies. ""But now they learn from each other and reached out to us first,"" Feng said. A PARLOR FOR THE WORLD With a lower threshold for market access, free flow of talent and more business-friendly measures, the Yangtze River Delta region is turning into a meeting hall for global investors. ""Obviously, it's one of the most important partners for Czech companies and for the Czech Republic,"" said Richard Krpac, consul general of the Czech Republic in Shanghai, who also noted that more than 100 Czech companies have already invested in the region. By hosting more than 130 international conferences last year, the region topped the list among China's three major city clusters, data from the International Congress and Convention Association showed. Shanghai and Hangzhou became the 2nd and 3rd hottest destination cities in China for international conferences, with 82 and 28 meetings held in 2018 respectively. Li Wei, vice director of the Yangtze River Delta and Yangtze River Economic Belt Research Center under the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said the region is quickening its pace of being a functional platform for the interconnection and integration of global elements and resources. ""We saw a lot of new products, technologies and services make their debuts in Shanghai at the China International Import Expo (CIIE),"" Li said, noting that the CIIE has become a platform to promote global multilateral trade. The trade mission of the Yangtze River Delta region was a shining star during the 2nd CIIE held in November, with more than 40,000 purchasers from Zhejiang making orders worth nearly 10 billion yuan (about 1.43 billion U.S. dollars). The Yangtze River Delta cities, represented by Shanghai, Hangzhou and Nanjing, are gateways of the Asian-Pacific region and a showcase of China's opening up, said Yang Xiangdong, vice head of the Zhejiang-based Yangtze Delta Region Institute of Tsinghua University. He also noted that the region enjoys exceptional advantages such as a solid industrial foundation, China's huge domestic market and reform and opening-up policies. ""As the Yangtze River Delta further integrates, a world-class city cluster is on the rise,"" Yang said."	CCTV

The Ukrainian government received in return 76 detainees, the presidential office said.  The exchange came after Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky held their first face-to-face talks in Paris on 9 December and agreed on measures to de-escalate Europe's only active war.  Among those released by the separatists, were civilians who said they were arrested and held captive for years after visiting family in the region. Prisoners fled off coaches at the heavily-guarded Mayorske checkpoint in the eastern Donetsk region, many carrying plastic bags stuffed with their belongings. They were ushered into tents surrounded by armed military personnel. Kiev was expected to hand over several riot policemen suspected of killing protesters during its pro-EU uprising in 2014 - a move that has sparked controversy, with families accusing Kiev of bowing to Russian pressure. The conflict began after a Ukraine revolution brought in a pro-EU government, prompting Russian-backed separatists to take control of the pro-Russian East. Since then more than 13,000 people have been killed in the conflict. Though the prisoner swap is a major milestone, there is still much to be resolved before a lasting peace is ensured. While all sides agree on the need for local elections, demilitarisation and some degree of autonomy, there are still disagreements on the order and degree to which they should happen. Russia's President Vladimir Putin says he worries about a potential massacre if Ukraine regains control of its eastern border without passing an amnesty law for the residents who live there. But critics accuse President Putin of using the conflict to advance Russia's interests.	CCTV

Wang made the remarks during a phone conversation with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. Le Drian expounded the views of the French side on the current situation in the Middle East, stressing that France opposes the use of force in international relations and Iraq's territorial sovereignty should be respected. It is vital to preserve the Iran nuclear deal under the current circumstance, Le Drian said, adding that the French side hopes to stay in close communication with China and play a positive role in preventing the escalation of regional tensions.  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (C) addresses the General Debate of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly at the UN headquarters in New York, on Sept. 25, 2019.

(Xinhua/Liu Jie) Wang said China shares a similar position with France on the issue. Noting that the two countries are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and shoulder important responsibilities in maintaining world peace and stability, he said it is necessary for them to strengthen strategic communication and play a constructive role in jointly safeguarding the principles of the UN Charter and the basic norms on international ties, and opposing any unilateral use of force. The Iran nuclear deal is an important result of multilateral diplomacy, which pools painstaking efforts of all parties concerned and supports regional peace and stability in the Middle East, he stressed.

China is beefing up nationwide action to contain the new pneumonia epidemic as 30 provincial-level regions reporting cases of novel coronavirus had all activated first-level public health emergency response mechanism as of Saturday.
A meeting of the Communist Party of China leadership on Saturday demanded all-out efforts to treat infected patients, speed up the augmentation of medical personnel and coordinate civilian and military medical resources.
MEDICAL STAFF, MATERIALS RUSHING TO WUHAN
More than half a million medical staff have joined the epidemic prevention, control and treatment of patients in Hubei, said Li Tao, an official with the Hubei Provincial Health Commission.
Meanwhile, five medical teams with a combined number of 686 doctors and nurses dispatched by Shanghai, Guangdong, Hunan, Sichuan and Zhejiang, have joined the treatment efforts in Hubei, the provincial commission said.
China will send an additional 12 teams of more than 1,600 medical staff to areas hit hard by the novel coronavirus outbreak in Hubei Province, Ma Xiaowei, director of the National Health Commission, said at a press conference on Sunday.
""We have also brought a large number of medical treatment materials. We believe our participation will add to the medical force and increase the confidence to overcome the epidemic,"" said Zhang Mingming, a member of the Shanghai medical team at the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital.
Three teams of military staff totaling 450, who flew to Wuhan on Friday night, immediately started work in three designated hospitals in Wuhan.
""I have no doubt that with all the concerted efforts from across the country, we will contain the epidemic situation,"" said Song Liqiang, 50, deputy head of the Xijing Hospital's Respiratory and ICU Department in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi Province. Song has experience working in the ICU during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
Hubei Province reported 323 new confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and 13 new deaths on Saturday, the provincial health authority said Sunday.
By the end of Saturday, the province reported 1,052 cumulative confirmed cases of pneumonia, with 52 deaths and 129 cases in severe condition.
Experts say the geographical distribution of Wuhan's infection cases which were first reported in late December, indicated a close relationship between the epidemic and a local seafood market.
The country has reported 1,975 confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV, including 324 in critical condition, in the provincial-level regions except for Tibet Autonomous Region. Pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV resulted in 56 deaths, according to the National Health Commission.
Wuhan authorities decided to build two makeshift hospitals -- Huoshenshan with 700 to 1,000 beds and Leishenshan with a capacity of 1,300 to 1,500 beds -- to treat the new pneumonia patients. Construction on the two facilities is underway. The Huoshenshan and Leishenshan hospitals will be put into use on Feb. 3 and Feb. 5, respectively.
""We've mobilized all the workers left in Wuhan to work in shifts to ensure round-the-clock construction,"" said Zhang Chongxi, general manager of the road and bridge company of Wuhan Construction.
Zhu Tingxuan, a nurse at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, volunteered to join the battle when her hospital issued a notice of recruitment on Jan. 7. With a sense of mission, she began to work in shifts at the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital the next day.
""I am very lucky that I do not sweat easily. Some colleagues took off their protective clothing after work, and they were completely soaked with sweat,"" the girl in her 20s said.
On Saturday, she was replaced by a new batch of colleagues so that she could get some rest. ""But if needed, I will surely return. I feel obligated to help the sick and share the pressure of my colleagues,"" she added.
JOINT BATTLE
On Saturday, 13 provincial-level regions, including Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Henan and Shandong, joined 17 others to activate first-level public health emergency response to the epidemic situation, with government employees in the health sector canceling their Spring Festival holiday and returning to their posts.
Beijing's Badaling Great Wall tourist site closed temporarily on Saturday. Temple fairs and other large-scale gatherings celebrating the Spring Festival were also canceled. Shanghai Disney Resort has temporarily closed due to the epidemic. Many other tourist spots and museums nationwide have closed for the time being.
Beijing's education authorities said Sunday kindergartens, primary, middle schools and universities in the city will postpone the opening of the spring semester.
The China Development Bank, one of the country's major policy banks, offered emergency loans worth 2 billion yuan (about 288.3 million U.S. dollars) Friday to Wuhan for prevention and control of the novel coronavirus.
The country's finance ministry Thursday allocated 1 billion yuan to support Hubei's battle against the disease. Over 2 million masks and related products are set to be provided for Wuhan, according to the Ministry of Commerce.
As of Saturday, Hubei has allocated 1.03 billion yuan to guarantee the rescue and treatment of the patients.
Early Sunday, 10,000 items of donated protective clothing in 100 cases were flown to Wuhan from Cambodia's Siem Reap.
""Many of our employees have volunteered to postpone their Spring Festival vacation and the factory is running at full capacity,"" said He Zhenhua, general manager of a protective products factory in Wuhan.
Ten plants in Guangdong Province have resumed production of masks.
In an unprecedented move on Jan. 23, all of Wuhan's public transportation, including city buses, subways, ferries and long-distance coaches as well as outbound channels at airports and railway stations, were suspended to contain the spread of the virus. Other Hubei cities such as Jingzhou, Huanggang, Ezhou, Xiaogan and Yichang also imposed transport restrictions.
Measures have also been taken in rural areas nationwide to prevent the disease. Many citizens canceled their trips home. In some regions, visiting relatives, a tradition of the Spring Festival, is not encouraged this year. Large banquets for weddings were canceled or postponed.
Confirmed cases were also reported in China's Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, as well as Thailand, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United States, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, France and Australia.

237	http://english.cctv.com/2019/11/17/ARTIpB3G6JaQtvN58Klf9PKL191117.shtml	11-17-2019	"Fresh ""Yellow Vests"" violence erupts in Paris despite Macron's economic reforms"	"PARIS, Nov. 16 -- Violence erupted Saturday in Paris where Yellow Vests movement staged a fresh action to mark its first anniversary amid continued social unrest over President Emmanuel Macron's economic reforms.
Tear gas clouds rose into the air near Porte d'Italie in southern Paris where first clashes between police and protestors broke out early in the morning after a few hundred demonstrators set on fire barricades and threw projectiles at police officers.
Police responded with tear gas to disperse the crowd. It also intervened to clear the Peripherique ring which ""Yellow Vest"" tried to occupy.
Tension flared further after a group of masked youth tried to vandalize a shopping center. They overturned many vehicles and torched several bins in Place d'Italie. Tear gas and stun grenades had been used to push back the crowd.
By 15:00 local time (14:00 GMT), 61 individuals were arrested and more than 1,400 preventive checks had been carried out, according to Paris prefecture.
Authorities have banned protests in the Champs Elysees avenue, the Arc de Triomphe monument, and near the National Assembly which had been the flashpoints of clashes and vandalism in last year's social unrest.
Amid continued social uproar over the government's economic and fiscal roadmap which protestors say favor the rich, ""Yellow Vests"" are planning 270 rallies and blockades for this weekend.
""I think 'Yellow Vest' demonstrators will mobilize massively to show that anger is still there. It is bigger today than it was a year ago because (President) Emmanuel Macron did not answer our demands...to restore fiscal justice,"" Francois Boulo, the movement's representative in Rouen in northwest France told BFMTV news channel.
On Nov. 17, 2018, the movement, which got its name from the high visibility vests drivers keep in their cars, started as a campaign against an increase in diesel's price, most commonly used car fuel in France, that Macron said is necessary to combat climate change.
It had been morphed into social rebellion with sometimes violent action causing weekly chaos in French cities, notably in Paris.
A year on, and despite billion-euro sweeteners Macron has already offered to defuse the tension, ""many thousands of people"" are set to participate in the 53rd act, suggesting that the gloom in the Elysee Palace is not over at a time when the contested pro-market reforms start to bear fruit.
UPBEAT ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
When Macron, the former investment banker, came to power on May 14, 2017, he promised to get the country out of weak growth, bring down rampant jobless rate and create more wealth.
Half-way into his five year-term, economic activities in the eurozone's second main powerhouse hold up better than its European neighbours and unemployment is down.
""The French economy is doing better. More work needed to be done but the government's economic policy already gives results,"" tweeted on Friday Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.
Macron had cut taxes on companies and investors and eased labor regulations to make hiring and firing easier to encourage recruitment. As a result, 540,000 new jobs have been created since 2017, while unemployment rate hits 10-year low to 8.6 percent, government's data showed.
Climate has changed enough in two years to make France a top destination for foreign investment in Europe, according to Ernst & Young consulting firm.
Amid high concerns about the international trade dispute and Brexit impact, French economy, defying slowdown forecast, rose by 0.3 percent in the third quarter of 2019 thanks to boosted domestic demand, data from national statistics institute Insee showed.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) predicted in its last interim outlook that French economy would expand by 1.3 percent this year, above 1.1-percent expected across the broader eurozone thanks to ""significant reform agenda.""
It said that if fully implemented Macron's reforms could boost GDP per capita by 3.2 percent at a 10-year horizon and would mostly benefit middle- and lower-income households in the medium term.
The rosy economic indicators seemed to have boosted Macron's ambition to modernize the country and keep the economic momentum, but at the same time, his reform drive ignited domestic discontent.
HEADWIND AHEAD
Elected on a ticket to help businesses, the French president had been changing labor code, injecting dynamism into public services and institutions and reforming rail sector and education system, areas where he was facing fierce opposition that drew thousands to the country's streets in addition to strikes.
Up next on his agenda: reforming pension system, improving public healthcare service and accelerating energy transition. But continued social unrest and accusations that he was ignoring workers, and being out of reach, likely to undermine his next reform push.
""I'm here to continue to transform the country, to make it progress. I do not want to move forward in division but not at the price of inaction,"" said Macron on Thursday when about 10,000 hospital workers took the streets in Paris to denounce low pay and poor working conditions in over-capacity emergency rooms.
Earlier this week, students have also demonstrated across France to protest over living conditions after a destitute young student set himself on fire.
Yet trade union-led calls for mass strikes on Dec. 5 against the government's proposal to change pension regime suggested that the French top official has to further roll his sleeves up to defuse public anger.
""There are significant results on employment, honorable on growth...Certainly Emmanuel Macron has changed things,"" Alain Duhamel, a political commentator said.

And, if he can continue the dynamic and sometimes bumpy change or it will be blocked by a powerful refusal,"" he wrote in the weekly newspaper Liberation.  PARIS, Nov. 16 -- Violence erupted Saturday in Paris where Yellow Vests movement staged a fresh action to mark its first anniversary amid continued social unrest over President Emmanuel Macron's economic reforms. Tear gas clouds rose into the air near Porte d'Italie in southern Paris where first clashes between police and protestors broke out early in the morning after a few hundred demonstrators set on fire barricades and threw projectiles at police officers. Police responded with tear gas to disperse the crowd. It also intervened to clear the Peripherique ring which ""Yellow Vest"" tried to occupy. Tension flared further after a group of masked youth tried to vandalize a shopping center. They overturned many vehicles and torched several bins in Place d'Italie. Tear gas and stun grenades had been used to push back the crowd. By 15:00 local time (14:00 GMT), 61 individuals were arrested and more than 1,400 preventive checks had been carried out, according to Paris prefecture. Authorities have banned protests in the Champs Elysees avenue, the Arc de Triomphe monument, and near the National Assembly which had been the flashpoints of clashes and vandalism in last year's social unrest. Amid continued social uproar over the government's economic and fiscal roadmap which protestors say favor the rich, ""Yellow Vests"" are planning 270 rallies and blockades for this weekend. ""I think 'Yellow Vest' demonstrators will mobilize massively to show that anger is still there. It is bigger today than it was a year ago because (President) Emmanuel Macron did not answer our demands...to restore fiscal justice,"" Francois Boulo, the movement's representative in Rouen in northwest France told BFMTV news channel. On Nov. 17, 2018, the movement, which got its name from the high visibility vests drivers keep in their cars, started as a campaign against an increase in diesel's price, most commonly used car fuel in France, that Macron said is necessary to combat climate change. It had been morphed into social rebellion with sometimes violent action causing weekly chaos in French cities, notably in Paris. A year on, and despite billion-euro sweeteners Macron has already offered to defuse the tension, ""many thousands of people"" are set to participate in the 53rd act, suggesting that the gloom in the Elysee Palace is not over at a time when the contested pro-market reforms start to bear fruit. UPBEAT ECONOMIC OUTLOOK When Macron, the former investment banker, came to power on May 14, 2017, he promised to get the country out of weak growth, bring down rampant jobless rate and create more wealth. Half-way into his five year-term, economic activities in the eurozone's second main powerhouse hold up better than its European neighbours and unemployment is down. ""The French economy is doing better. More work needed to be done but the government's economic policy already gives results,"" tweeted on Friday Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. Macron had cut taxes on companies and investors and eased labor regulations to make hiring and firing easier to encourage recruitment. As a result, 540,000 new jobs have been created since 2017, while unemployment rate hits 10-year low to 8.6 percent, government's data showed. Climate has changed enough in two years to make France a top destination for foreign investment in Europe, according to Ernst & Young consulting firm. Amid high concerns about the international trade dispute and Brexit impact, French economy, defying slowdown forecast, rose by 0.3 percent in the third quarter of 2019 thanks to boosted domestic demand, data from national statistics institute Insee showed. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) predicted in its last interim outlook that French economy would expand by 1.3 percent this year, above 1.1-percent expected across the broader eurozone thanks to ""significant reform agenda."" It said that if fully implemented Macron's reforms could boost GDP per capita by 3.2 percent at a 10-year horizon and would mostly benefit middle- and lower-income households in the medium term. The rosy economic indicators seemed to have boosted Macron's ambition to modernize the country and keep the economic momentum, but at the same time, his reform drive ignited domestic discontent. HEADWIND AHEAD Elected on a ticket to help businesses, the French president had been changing labor code, injecting dynamism into public services and institutions and reforming rail sector and education system, areas where he was facing fierce opposition that drew thousands to the country's streets in addition to strikes. Up next on his agenda: reforming pension system, improving public healthcare service and accelerating energy transition. But continued social unrest and accusations that he was ignoring workers, and being out of reach, likely to undermine his next reform push. ""I'm here to continue to transform the country, to make it progress. I do not want to move forward in division but not at the price of inaction,"" said Macron on Thursday when about 10,000 hospital workers took the streets in Paris to denounce low pay and poor working conditions in over-capacity emergency rooms. Earlier this week, students have also demonstrated across France to protest over living conditions after a destitute young student set himself on fire.

His full interview was published on Wednesday.  Since the end of 2018, more than 70 foreign delegations, or some 1,000 people, including staff from Al-Ahram, have visited Xinjiang, Wang noted. ""They saw first-hand a stable, thriving and developing Xinjiang and stated that its counter-terrorism and deradicalization efforts can provide inspirations for others.""   Some western media choose to ignore basic facts, Wang emphasized, reiterating their stance on making lies to smear and discredit the counter-terrorism and deradicalization efforts in Xinjiang, and even try to drive a wedge between China and Islamic countries.    ""Stability is the precondition for development. What Xinjiang has accomplished today would not have been possible without the measures taken in recent years to counter terrorism and maintain stability,"" Wang told the newspaper. During a meeting with Secretary General of the Arab League Ahmed Aboul Gheit on Tuesday, Wang also appreciated its firm supports for Xinjiang, as Gheit said the Arab League totally understood China's position on Xinjiang-related issues, and will never impose its will on China.   Wang is on a tour of Egypt, Djibouti, Eritrea, Burundi and Zimbabwe from January 7 to 13, which is in line with a long-standing tradition that has seen Chinese foreign ministers begin each year with trips to Africa.   Libya In his interview, Wang also briefed China's stance on recent escalation of tensions in the eastern Mediterranean area as Turkey's violation of the sovereignty of Libya and oil and gas resources in the Mediterranean region has escalated tensions in that region.  ""The military option would lead nowhere and only cause endless trouble,"" Wang said, adding that China supports a ""Libyan-led and Libyan-owned"" political process under the auspices of the UN to help end conflicts, resume political dialogue, and bring about lasting peace as early as possible.   What is most pressing is for all relevant parties to act in the fundamental interests of the Libyan people and peace and stability of the region, facilitate an early ceasefire between the conflicting parties in Libya and bring them back to the track of dialogue and negotiation, he said. Echoing Wang's views on the Libyan situation, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang said at the daily presser on Wednesday that China always believes that the Libyan issue can only be truly and properly settled by political means. "	CCTV

(Xinhua/Du Xiaoyi)
Wang made the remarks while attending a reception for China-Japan people-to-people exchanges hosted by the Chinese embassy in Tokyo. Earlier on Monday, the two countries launched a high-level consultation mechanism on people-to-people exchanges.
Wang said that China and Japan are neighbors with a long history of exchanges of more than 2,000 years. Thanks to the joint efforts of both sides, cultural and people-to-people exchanges between China and Japan are gaining new vitality.
The two peoples have more frequent exchanges with each other. The number of visits between Chinese and Japanese people is expected to reach 12 million this year, equivalent to more than 30,000 daily between the two countries, Wang said. Back in 1972 when bilateral relations were normalized, the number was less than 10,000 for a year.
Chinese people see Japan as a popular destination for overseas travel. China welcomes more Japanese friends to visit different parts of its vast land and feel the rapid changes that are happening there, he said.
Wang noted that the mutual understanding between the two peoples has been deepening. With more and more communications with each other, the distance between heart and heart is getting closer.
This May, a Japanese youth wrote to Chinese President Xi Jinping about his own experience from never knowing China to falling in love with the country, expressing strong desire and belief in helping promote China-Japan friendship, Wang said. President Xi sent a reply to him, hoping that the youth of the two countries will make positive contributions to the bright future of bilateral relations.
Meanwhile, people-to-people and cultural exchanges between the two countries have become more colorful with increasing exchanges of books, films and TV programs, said Wang. As Tokyo and Beijing will host the Olympic Games next year and the Winter Olympics in 2022 respectively, he called on the two sides to strengthen mutual support and cooperation to ensure the success of the events.
Wang stressed that to promote people-to-people exchanges between China and Japan, the two peoples are the real protagonists, and the local areas are broad stages while the youth are the hope for the future. The two sides should work together to usher in a new era of exchanges between peoples, localities and youth.
More than 200 officials and celebrities from all walks of life of the two countries attended the reception, including former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, Education Minister Koichi Hagiuda, Land and Transport Minister Kazuyoshi Akaba, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike and Chinese ambassador to Japan Kong Xuanyou.

According to the vice president, in the 70 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people have found a road of socialism with Chinese characteristics suitable for themselves. Great changes have taken place in the country, the living standards of the people have been improved, and historic achievements have been made, he told the forum.

Shifting troubles to others is not the right way forward. Collective response is the only viable solution.""
Through concrete actions, such as promoting Belt and Road cooperation, hosting the China International Import Expo, reducing the items on the negative list for foreign investment access and improving the business environment, China is sharing with the world the vast opportunities of its development, he noted.
Wang said: ""The evolution of history is never a linear course. Only when seeing the direction clearly, can we make a rational and informed choice. The more difficulties we face, the more imperative it is for us to stay focused and patient, take concerted and vigorous actions, and let the sensible approach prevail.""

The Greek government also criticized Turkey for allegedly ""directing and encouraging"" the increased refugee and migrant flows to its borders in the past few days.
""This movement is directed and encouraged by Turkey. These actions are taking place in violation of its obligations under the EU-Turkey joint statement,"" Greek government spokesperson Stelios Petsas said on Sunday night after a meeting of the Government Council for National Security, referring to the agreement launched in 2016 aimed to stem the refugee and migrant influx.
The council took the decision to increase the level of deterrence at Greece's borders to the maximum, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted, announcing that on Tuesday he will visit Evros land border in the north with European Council President Charles Michel.
""The borders of Greece are the external borders of Europe. We will protect them..."" the prime minister said.
In Sunday's meeting, it was also decided that from now on Greece will not be accepting any new asylum applications for one month by people entering the country illegally and will be immediately returned to their country of origin if possible, spokesperson Petsas announced.
In addition, Greece was formally requesting European Border and Coast Guard Agency's (Frontex) increased presence in the region and EU's full support to Greece with concrete measures, the spokesperson said.
More than 13,000 people have gathered at the land border between Greece and Turkey, according to International Organization for Migration, after Ankara's message in the past few days that Turkish authorities can no longer prevent people from reaching Europe's borders.
For a third consecutive day, on Sunday, Greek police and army forces guarded the land border, briefly clashing with groups of people attempting to cross the borderline, Greek national news agency AMNA reported.
The Greek Foreign Ministry tweeted Sunday that some 10,000 people were ""prevented from entering Greek territory (all along Evros) from yesterday morning to this morning.""
""No one can cross the Greek borders. All those attempting illegal entry, are effectively prevented from entering,"" read a second tweet.
At least six inflatable dinghies with 300 refugees and migrants landed on the shores of Lesbos and another 200 in two other islands on Sunday, according to AMNA.
In at least one case on Lesbos, groups of locals prevented their disembarkation and Coast Guard vessels transferred the people to another site, Xinhua witnessed.
Other groups of islanders blocked the streets to Moria, Lesbos' refugee camp which currently hosts about 19,400 people, while its capacity is about 2,800, according to official data provided by Greece's Citizen Protection ministry.
More than 42,000 refugees and migrants are currently on five Greek islands in reception facilities which have been overflowing for months, according to the figures provided by the Greek government.
Locals request the central government to transfer part of them to the mainland, protesting that local communities can no longer shoulder the disproportionate burden.

In an open-ended social action likely to paralyse France, world's top tourism destination during Christmas holidays, transport networks are heavily disrupted, forcing millions of workers to switch to bikes and e-scooters, use car-sharing services or work from home. Only one in 10 high-speed trains is operational and only 10 percent of regional trains are running. Around half of Eurostar frequencies are cancelled and only one in three Thalys trains between Paris and Brussels operates, according to state-run railway operator SNCF. Most of the Paris metro lines are shut and 20 percent of scheduled flights are cancelled. ""Transport networks will be very disrupted today like tomorrow and probably this weekend,"" warned Minister of State for Transport Jean-Baptiste Djebbari. ""We think that the strike can still last a few days,"" he told RTL radio. Truck drivers, police, firefighters, teachers and emergency rooms staff are all expected to join unions strike, posing a major test of Macron's political craftiness to push through reforms under pressure. An Ebale Opinion poll released on Wednesday showed 58 percent of people approved the protest against the reform, up by 5 percentage points from a survey conducted on Nov. 27. ""People have realized that their purchasing power will go down. Everyone will lose so everyone is mobilized. Macron's regime has made the choice of this confrontation,"" said Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of hard-left party ""France Unbowed"". In one of his major campaign promises, Macron proposes to merge the variety of 42 different pension set-ups for different professions into a universal system. The new single regime would use points so that each euro paid in would give the same retirement benefits no matter what sector pensioners worked in. The government argued that the reform is needed to bring costly pension system into balance. Critics say that would effectively force people to work longer, in particular public sector workers who have been allowed to retire earlier often because of hard working conditions. Assuring unions that his government would listen and negotiate, the French head of state remained ""determined"" and stressed that ""these reforms must be carried out in listening and consultation..."" his office told BMTV news channel. Widely seen as a taboo, pension overhaul had been failed during the previous governments. In 1995, SNCF unions staged three weeks of strikes that paralysed the country and forced then Prime Minister Alain Juppe to drop retirement reform plan and a program of welfare cutbacks and resign. The country's largest movement since 1968 forced then President Jacques Chirac to abandon the reform and dissolve the National Assembly."	CCTV

The U.S. has not yet ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which is one of the United Nations' core human rights conventions, nor has it solved its own increasingly serious problem of gender discrimination, said the article, adding that this has significantly hampered the realization of women's human rights in the United States. ""Gender discrimination is a grave problem in U.S. society,"" the article said, adding that U.S. women suffer long-term, systematic, extensive, and systemic discrimination both publicly and secretly, mainly involving economic gender inequality, serious violent offenses against women and lack of protection for health rights among racial minority women. ""The United States is the most economically developed country in the world, but it fails to effectively protect women's economic rights within the country,"" said the article. ""As such, U.S. women face serious discrimination in employment, payment, and career development.""   On violent offenses against women, the article said that one in every three women in the United States has been harmed by domestic violence. Women in prisons suffer from serious violence. Female soldiers are often victims of sexual harassment and sexual assault during their term of military service. More than 32 percent of women in the U.S. military said they had been sexually assaulted, and 80 percent said they had been sexually harassed, said the article, citing surveys. On the lack of protection for health rights among racial minority women, the article said the mortality rates of racial minority women during childbirth or shortly after delivery are higher than those of white women in the United States. The article also said U.S. women face serious problems of sexual harassment and sexual assault on campus and in workplace. ""The serious problem of gender discrimination in the United States severely hinders the realization of women's human rights, exacerbates social inequality in the country and hinders the development of the international human rights cause,"" said the article. The serious problem of gender discrimination in the United States stems from profound and multi-faceted reasons. These include the historical tradition of gender discrimination, the patriarchal culture, and particularly, drawbacks of the U.S. social system, which constitute fundamental hindrances to the elimination of gender discrimination in the United States, said the article. It also highlighted that, for years, the United States has been practicing ""double standards"" on human rights issues, using human rights just as a tool to maintain world hegemony, criticize other countries and interfere in other countries' internal affairs, while neglecting its own serious human rights issues. What the United States has done runs counter to the values and objectives regarding human rights, said the article, adding that the United States has increasingly become a ""disturber"" and a ""troublemaker"" in the international human rights field and has seriously jeopardized the healthy development of the international human rights cause."

Extending congratulations, a spokesperson with the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said the central government will carry out the appointment process in accordance with the law after receiving the formal report of the election delivered by the Macao SAR government. Ho, if approved by the central government, is set to take the helm of the SAR government at the end of this year.
2019 marks the 20th anniversary of Macao's return to the motherland and is a key moment in terms of building on past successes to further advance the SAR's development. The chief executive is responsible for further promoting the ""one country, two systems"" practice, safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests and maintaining the long-term prosperity and stability of the Macao SAR.
VITALITY OF ""ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS""
Featuring stability, prosperity and constant improvement in people's wellbeing, Macao's development over the past 20 years has demonstrated the great vitality of the ""one country, two systems"" policy.
For 20 years, Macao's economy has kept growing at an annual average rate of over 10 percent, with a per capita GDP now ranking among the highest in the world.
The monthly median income of the SAR's residents rose from 9,000 patacas (about 1,100 U.S. dollars) to 16,300 patacas, and the unemployment rate has remained below 2 percent in recent years.
Constant growth has been observed over the years in Macao's annual number of inbound travelers, which crossed the mark of 35 million in 2018.
Meanwhile, some social problems arose amid the rapid development of Macao's economy and the SAR is faced with certain risks and challenges from both internal and external, including economic diversification, housing, inflation, youth development and tourism capacity.
All these require the new chief executive and the new SAR government seize the SAR's role and opportunities in the national development strategy, achieve Macao's better development in the country's reform and opening up in the new era and contribute to the national rejuvenation.
After formally announcing his bid for the election, Ho and his team visited communities to listen to people's opinions. He has met representatives of hundreds of social groups in Macao to discuss issues the masses are concerned about.
INTEGRATION INTO NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
Only when the motherland sees sound development can Macao achieve better development.
With an increasingly strong motherland as Macao's strong backing, now is the time for the SAR, with constant improvement of its competitiveness, to actively integrate itself into the overall national development.
In February 2019, the central authorities unveiled the outline development plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, which lists Macao as one of the core engines for regional development in the Greater Bay Area, along with Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
This is a move that allows Macao to stand at the tide of the Greater Bay Area development, starting a new stage for the SAR's development.
Now that the goal has been set, it is imperative to press ahead.
In his political platform, Ho said he is willing to devote himself to the service of the country, Macao and its residents, work together with Macao residents to facilitate the country's opening up on all fronts, and actively integrate Macao into the overall national development.
Ho, who was a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and president of the Legislative Assembly of the Macao SAR, has a profound understanding of national policies and the actual situation in Macao.
Ho is up to the central government's standard for the position, as he loves the country and Macao and is trusted by the central government, capable of governing the SAR and supported by the people of Macao.

Korea confirms 144 more cases of COVID-19, 977 in total	"SEOUL, Feb. 25 -- South Korea confirmed 144 more cases of the COVID-19 on Tuesday, raising the total number of infections to 977, and the death toll rose to 10.
As of 4:00 p.m. local time, the number of infected patients totaled 977, up 144 from the prior day. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has updated the data twice a day at 10:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. local time.
The virus infections soared for the past week, with 802 new cases reported from Wednesday to Monday. The country raised its four-tier virus alert to the highest ""red"" level on Sunday.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in visited the country's southeastern city of Daegu, where more than half of the virus infections were reported, saying the viral spread within and beyond the southeastern region must be contained.
""What matters is time and speed. Within this week, a clear point of inflection must be created in the growing trend of confirmed patients,"" Moon said during a special meeting in Daegu with relevant ministers and the representatives of Daegu, according to the presidential Blue House.
Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun was scheduled to stay in Daegu from Tuesday night to spearhead the government's quarantine efforts in Daegu, about 300 km southeast of the capital Seoul, and its surrounding North Gyeongsang province.
Senior government and Blue House officials and the ruling Democratic Party leaders had an emergency meeting in Seoul, vowing to take ""maximum"" quarantine steps in the southeastern region and push for a supplementary budget to financially support small firms and microbusiness owners.
President Moon ordered government officials on Monday to draw up the extra budget to support the southeastern region. The Moon government's 2020 budget was a record 512.5 trillion won (422.8 billion U.S. dollars).
Of the total patients, 791 were residents in Daegu and North Gyeongsang province. The figures for Seoul, Gyeonggi province and the southeastern port city of Busan were 40, 42 and 43 respectively.
Two clusters of infections in the southeastern region led to the recent viral spread.
As of Tuesday morning, 501 cases were linked to the church services of a minor religious group, called Sincheonji, in Daegu. It accounted for 56.1 percent of the total.
The KCDC planned to complete the test of more than 1,200 Sincheonji followers of the Daegu branch traced to the church services, who showed infection symptoms, until Wednesday.
The health authorities recommended all of about 200,000 Sincheon followers nationwide to stay at home and refrain from outside activity, ordering the followers of the Daegu branch to be placed under self-quarantine.
The Seoul city government issued an emergency administrative decree to ban any gathering relevant to Sincheonji, while the local government of its surrounding Gyeonggi province forcibly closed down facilities linked to Sincheonji.
Meanwhile, the other 113 cases were traced to Daenam Hospital in Cheongdo county, just south of Daegu. Test for all of 652 patients and medical staff was completed as almost all the patients at the hospital's psychiatric ward tested positive for the virus.
One more death was confirmed in North Gyeongsang province, lifting the death toll to 10. Seven of the deaths were linked to the hospital.
The number of patients in critical conditions increased to six, raising the possibility for further deaths.
The government designated Deagu and Cheongdo as a ""special care zone"" Friday, while protest rallies were banned in downtown areas of Seoul.

What did Morales say? Morales thanked Mexico for ""saving his life"" as he arrived to take up asylum in the country. He repeated his accusation that his rivals had ousted him in a coup after violence broke out following a disputed election last month. ""As long as I am alive, we will remain in politics. As long as I am alive, the fight continues,"" Morales told reporters after disembarking the plane, dressed in a blue short-sleeved shirt. He was met by Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard. Morales was then whisked away in a military helicopter, television footage showed. Mexican officials have not said where he will stay, citing security concerns. What's happening in Bolivia? In Bolivia's capital La Paz, meanwhile, politicians and civic leaders scrambled to restore order after weeks of protests that finally brought down Morales, the last of a wave of Latin American leftists who dominated the region's politics at the start of the century. His resignation came after the Organization of American States (OAS) declared there were serious irregularities during the October 20 vote, prompting political allies to quit and the army to urge him to step down. Street clashes, looting and road blocks have roiled the poor South American nation since the election, and there have been more flare-ups since the former president resigned. Video footage on Tuesday showed police battling Morales' supporters in the city of Cochabamba. ""We are emerging from one of the darkest episodes of our democratic history,"" said Jeanine Anez, an opposition senator theoretically in line to take over as interim leader. ""I ask that from now on we join forces and our hands to help rebuild democracy and the rule of law.” Lawmakers across the political divide were called to attend a meeting of Bolivia's Legislative Assembly to formally accept Morales' resignation and plan for next steps. Still, many with Morales' Movement for Socialism party stayed away. Morales' dramatic flight to Mexico Morales arrived in Mexico after taking off from the central Bolivian town of Chimore, a stronghold of his supporters and where the country's first indigenous president retreated as his 14-year rule imploded. But Morales' journey was far from simple. Takeoff was delayed, with supporters surrounding the airport. Then the plane was denied permission to refuel in Peru, Ebrard said, so it diverted to Paraguay, a stop which he said Argentine President-elect Alberto Fernandez helped arrange. Ebrard had earlier tweeted a photo of Morales alone in the jet with a downcast expression, displaying Mexico's red, white and green flag across his lap. In a region divided along ideological lines over Morales' fall, Mexico's leftist government has supported his accusations of a coup. U.S. President Donald Trump meanwhile said that the resignation was a boost for democracy. Paraguayan President Mario Abdo said on Tuesday his country had also been willing to grant political asylum to Morales, though he disagreed with accusations of a coup. ""If he resigned, it is not a coup. He resigned,"" he said."	CCTV

(Xinhua/Ju Peng)
The Chinese nation has experienced many ordeals in its history, but it has never been overwhelmed. Instead, it has become more and more courageous, growing up and rising up from the hardships, Xi said.
The epidemic situation remains grim and complex and it is now a most crucial moment to curb the spread, he noted.
Xi asked Party committees and governments at all levels to continue to make unremitting efforts in various prevention and control work and resume work and production in an orderly manner.
Efforts should be made to fully unleash the huge potential and powerful driving force of China's development and strive to achieve the goals and tasks for economic and social development this year, Xi said.
On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, Xi extended sincere greetings to Party members, officials and the general public throughout the country, especially those in Hubei Province and its capital city Wuhan, and expressed respect to the medical workers, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and comrades from various sectors who have been fighting on the front line of epidemic prevention and control.
He also expressed his sincere gratitude to compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, overseas Chinese, as well as to countries, international organizations and friendly people that have provided various support to the epidemic prevention and control.
Xi also expressed deep condolences to compatriots and medical personnel who lost their lives in the fight against the epidemic, and sincere sympathy to patients and their families who are struggling with the disease, as well as to the families of those who died on duty and the deceased patients.
Sunday's meeting was presided over by Li Keqiang and attended by Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Wang Huning, Zhao Leji and Han Zheng.
POSITIVE TREND EXPANDING
Xi said since the start of the outbreak the CPC Central Committee has attached great importance to the issue, made swift deployment, strengthened the centralized, unified leadership of the Party, requiring Party committees and governments at all levels to put people's lives and health as the top priority and adopt effective measures to curb the spread of the virus.
The CPC Central Committee has made it a prominent task to improve the admission and cure rates and reduce the infection and mortality rates, Xi said, noting that Wuhan and Hubei have been taken as the country's main battlefield against the epidemic.
Efforts have also been made to strengthen the emergency supply of medical materials and daily necessities, safeguard social stability and win the support of the international community, he added.
The COVID-19 outbreak is a major public health emergency that has spread in the fastest speed, caused the most extensive infection and is the most difficult to contain in the country since the founding of the People's Republic of China, said Xi.
""This is both a crisis and a big test for us,"" Xi said, adding that after arduous work, the positive trend in the prevention and control work is now expanding.
""It has been proven that the CPC Central Committee's judgment on the situation of the epidemic is accurate, all work arrangements are timely, and the measures taken are effective,"" said Xi.
""The results of the prevention and control work have once again demonstrated the notable advantages of the leadership of the CPC and the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics,"" he added.
SOLID, METICULOUS EFFORTS REQUIRED
Xi called for firm, solid and meticulous efforts in the epidemic prevention and control, urging Party committees and governments at all levels to remain vigilant and make unremitting efforts in the epidemic prevention and control work.
No victory should be lightly announced until there is a complete win, Xi said, making the following demands:
-- Hubei Province, as well as its capital city Wuhan, should be safeguarded with resolute efforts, with focal attention paid to containing the spread at communities and treating the patients;
-- The epidemic prevention and control work in Beijing should be carried out with all-out efforts. Both imported cases and spread within the city should be prevented;
-- Medical resources and key supplies should be allocated in a scientific manner, providing more protection for the medical workers;
-- Scientific research should be accelerated in terms of drug and vaccine development. Effective diagnosis and treatment plans should be summarized and promoted in time;
-- International and regional cooperation should be expanded. Good communication with the World Health Organization and experience sharing with relevant countries should be continued;
-- Public communication through news media should be more effective. Release of epidemic information should be improved;
-- Social stability should be well safeguarded. Illegal activities disturbing medical treatment, epidemic prevention, and market and social order should be severely punished.
IMPACT MANAGEABLE
The impact of the epidemic on China's economic and social development is temporary and generally manageable, Xi noted.
He said the COVID-19 epidemic will inevitably deal a relatively big blow to China's economic and social development. However, at such a time it is even more important to view China's development in a comprehensive, dialectical and long-term perspective, and to strengthen and firm up confidence.
In general, the fundamentals of China's long-term sound economic growth remain unchanged, Xi added.
ORDERLY RESUMPTION OF WORK, PRODUCTION
Stressing orderly resumption of work and production, Xi made specific requirements to that end.
Each region should adopt a precise approach when advancing resumption of work and production based on local health risks, Xi said.
Regions with relatively low risks should reorient their disease prevention and control strategies as soon as possible to focus on forestalling imported cases and comprehensively restoring the order of production and life, Xi said.
Medium-risk regions should promote work and production resumption in an orderly manner based on local epidemic-control situations, while high-risk regions should continue to be fully committed to doing a good job in epidemic prevention and control, he said.
Xi stressed strengthening the regulation role of macro-economic policies, calling for more positivity in the country's proactive fiscal policy and the roll-out of more targeted interim policies in cutting taxes and fees to help micro, small and medium-sized firms tide over difficulties.
Besides, the prudent monetary policy should feature more flexibility and moderation, Xi said, calling for making good use of existing financial support policies and introducing new policies and measures in due course.
China will step up efforts to keep employment stable, with all-round measures to cut corporate burdens, keep the payroll stable, and create more jobs, Xi said, adding that in addressing the outstanding problems of serious scarcity of workers in some enterprises, high pressure in keeping the payroll stable, and difficulty of key groups to obtain employment, efforts should be given to support flexible employment through multiple channels and facilitate employment of college graduates.
The country should resolutely accomplish the task of alleviating poverty despite the impact of the epidemic, Xi said, urging efforts to help poor workers return to their posts in an orderly manner, support leading poverty alleviation enterprises and workshops to resume work as soon as possible, and improve mechanisms to prevent people from returning to poverty.
Xi underscored efforts to push for the resumption of work and production with precise epidemic prevention and control strategies, while smoothing travels and logistics channels and lifting cargo transport bans to push all links in the industrial chains to resume work and production in a coordinated way.
The country should actively expand effective domestic demand, fast-track the progress of projects under construction and new ones, as well as enhance guarantees for labor, land, funds and other production factors. 
In the meantime, China will ensure the timely agriculture work in spring, Xi said.
In doing so, he urged efforts to address the protruding issues in spring farming preparation and ensure well-organized production, transportation and supply of farming materials.
Xi also noted that people's basic livelihood should be guaranteed, such as the supply of staple and non-staple food. Enhanced efforts should be made to take care of those in need as well as those losing their family members due to the epidemic. Efforts should also be made to coordinate medical treatment for patients with other diseases. 
The country should keep the foreign trade and investment stable amid the epidemic outbreak, Xi stressed.
Foreign trade policy tools like export tax rebates and export credit insurances should be put to good and full play to ensure smooth operation of foreign trade industrial chains and supply chains.
Major foreign investment projects should be well implemented, while opening-up of finance and other services should be expanded. Business environment should continue to be optimized to strengthen foreign businesses' confidence in long-term investment and operation in China, Xi said.
In order to win the people's war against the epidemic, the Party's leadership should be strengthened, Xi said.
Xi required cadres at all levels, especially the leading officials, to take initiative in fulfilling duties.
Cadres who make outstanding contributions should be awarded, while those who fail to perform their duties should be held accountable, Xi noted.
Stressing more care for primary-level cadres, Xi called for solving their practical difficulties in a timely manner and resolutely rectifying the practice of formalities for formalities' sake and bureaucratism.
Xi also required summing up experience and drawing lessons from the weak links exposed in the epidemic to improve the ability to deal with major public health emergencies.
While presiding over the meeting, Li Keqiang called for rallying more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core and required the solid and precise implementation of the decisions and policies made by the CPC Central Committee.
Li demanded efforts to achieve this year's economic and social development goals and tasks, and secure finishing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects and completing the 13th Five-Year Plan. The Chinese nation has experienced many ordeals in its history, but it has never been overwhelmed. Instead, it has become more and more courageous, growing up and rising up from the hardships, Xi said. ""No victory should be lightly announced until there is a complete win."" BEIJING, Feb. 23 -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday stressed unremitting efforts in the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic and coordination in advancing economic and social development. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks when delivering an important speech at a meeting in Beijing to advance the work on coordinating the prevention and control of the COVID-19 and economic and social development.  Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, delivers an important speech at a meeting to advance the work on coordinating the prevention and control of the COVID-19 and economic and social development, in Beijing, capital of China, Feb. 23, 2020. (Xinhua/Ju Peng) The Chinese nation has experienced many ordeals in its history, but it has never been overwhelmed. Instead, it has become more and more courageous, growing up and rising up from the hardships, Xi said. The epidemic situation remains grim and complex and it is now a most crucial moment to curb the spread, he noted. Xi asked Party committees and governments at all levels to continue to make unremitting efforts in various prevention and control work and resume work and production in an orderly manner. Efforts should be made to fully unleash the huge potential and powerful driving force of China's development and strive to achieve the goals and tasks for economic and social development this year, Xi said. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, Xi extended sincere greetings to Party members, officials and the general public throughout the country, especially those in Hubei Province and its capital city Wuhan, and expressed respect to the medical workers, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and comrades from various sectors who have been fighting on the front line of epidemic prevention and control. He also expressed his sincere gratitude to compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, overseas Chinese, as well as to countries, international organizations and friendly people that have provided various support to the epidemic prevention and control. Xi also expressed deep condolences to compatriots and medical personnel who lost their lives in the fight against the epidemic, and sincere sympathy to patients and their families who are struggling with the disease, as well as to the families of those who died on duty and the deceased patients. Sunday's meeting was presided over by Li Keqiang and attended by Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Wang Huning, Zhao Leji and Han Zheng. POSITIVE TREND EXPANDING Xi said since the start of the outbreak the CPC Central Committee has attached great importance to the issue, made swift deployment, strengthened the centralized, unified leadership of the Party, requiring Party committees and governments at all levels to put people's lives and health as the top priority and adopt effective measures to curb the spread of the virus. The CPC Central Committee has made it a prominent task to improve the admission and cure rates and reduce the infection and mortality rates, Xi said, noting that Wuhan and Hubei have been taken as the country's main battlefield against the epidemic. Efforts have also been made to strengthen the emergency supply of medical materials and daily necessities, safeguard social stability and win the support of the international community, he added. The COVID-19 outbreak is a major public health emergency that has spread in the fastest speed, caused the most extensive infection and is the most difficult to contain in the country since the founding of the People's Republic of China, said Xi. ""This is both a crisis and a big test for us,"" Xi said, adding that after arduous work, the positive trend in the prevention and control work is now expanding. ""It has been proven that the CPC Central Committee's judgment on the situation of the epidemic is accurate, all work arrangements are timely, and the measures taken are effective,"" said Xi. ""The results of the prevention and control work have once again demonstrated the notable advantages of the leadership of the CPC and the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics,"" he added. SOLID, METICULOUS EFFORTS REQUIRED Xi called for firm, solid and meticulous efforts in the epidemic prevention and control, urging Party committees and governments at all levels to remain vigilant and make unremitting efforts in the epidemic prevention and control work. No victory should be lightly announced until there is a complete win, Xi said, making the following demands: -- Hubei Province, as well as its capital city Wuhan, should be safeguarded with resolute efforts, with focal attention paid to containing the spread at communities and treating the patients; -- The epidemic prevention and control work in Beijing should be carried out with all-out efforts. Both imported cases and spread within the city should be prevented; -- Medical resources and key supplies should be allocated in a scientific manner, providing more protection for the medical workers; -- Scientific research should be accelerated in terms of drug and vaccine development.

An emergency meeting of Arab foreign ministers is held at the Arab League headquarters in Cairo, Egypt, on Feb. 1, 2020. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said here on Saturday that his authority informed the Israeli and U.S. sides that it will ""cut all relations"" with them over the recently released U.S. peace plan. (Xinhua/Ahmed Gomaa)
""Rejection of the U.S.-Israeli Deal of the Century comes as it does not fulfill the minimum rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people,"" said the final communique issued by the foreign ministers following the meeting.
The statement described as ""unfair"" the peace deal, announced on Jan. 28 by U.S. President Donald Trump in the presence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The U.S. vision of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process includes annexing the disputed holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's ""undivided capital"" while the Palestinian capital will include areas on the outskirts of East Jerusalem.
The U.S. president outlined the 80-page plan, saying it proposes a ""realistic"" two-state solution.
The Trump administration has postponed several times the publication of its ""Deal of the Century,"" a proposal that has been criticized repeatedly by the Palestinians who had little engagement in it.
The final statement of Arab foreign ministers agreed to boycott the U.S. ""unfair deal"" and not to cooperate ""in any way"" with the United States in its implementation.
The U.S. plan ""violates the references of the peace process based on the international law and the relevant United Nations resolutions,"" the Arab ministers added.
They also highlighted the Arab Peace Initiative endorsed by the Arab League in Beirut in 2002 as the minimum acceptable limit to achieve peace ""through ending the Israeli occupation of all Palestinian and Arab territories occupied in 1967 and the establishment of the independent, sovereign state of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital.""
The final statement agreed on ""sticking to peace as a strategic option to settle the conflict,"" underlining the necessity of the two-state solution as the basis of the peace process.
They warned Israel against implementing the Trump-proposed deal unilaterally, reaffirming full support for the struggle of the Palestinian people and its leadership.
Speaking at the meeting, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the Palestinian Authority informed the Israelis that it will ""not have any relations with them or with the United States, including security relations.""
Abbas said his authority sent two letters to both Netanyahu and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency to convey the Palestinian rejection of the deal.
""The U.S. deal is completely rejected once they announced annexing Jerusalem to Israel,"" Abbas told the Arab foreign ministers at the meeting attended by Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul-Gheit.
The United States is a biased mediator, said Abbas, noting he will head to the UN Security Council to protest the deal and find a solution.
He condemned that Washington wants to abolish former UN resolutions and international legitimacy decisions related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and use the new U.S. plan as the only reference.
The Palestinian president said he declined the U.S. requests to receive a copy of the deal, nor letters and phone calls from Trump after the deal was announced.
""We have the right to continue our legitimate struggle through peaceful means to end the (Israeli) occupation and establish our independent state,"" said Abbas, calling for international and regional support for the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.
Abbas urged the formation of an international mechanism to implement the resolutions of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative endorsed by the AL in Beirut in 2002.
""We will not accept the United States as the sole mediator of the peace process,"" Abbas added.
Washington's role as an Israeli-Palestinian conflict mediator has been questioned with the Trump administration's pro-Israeli policies in the past three years such as recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, moving the U.S. embassy to the city, and slashing hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in humanitarian aid to the Palestinians.
The Palestinians seek to establish an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital in the light of the UN-proposed two-state solution based on the 1967 pre-war borders.

The negotiations were scheduled to end on Friday but continued throughout Saturday and into Sunday morning. With over 40 hours of extension, it was the longest COP in history, which was quite usual to be extended due to intense discussions.  MARKET MECHANISMS ""We had so many talks till so late, without sleeping all night,"" said Carolina Schmidt, chairwoman of the COP25 and the environment minister of Chile, at the closing plenary of the conference that ended Sunday afternoon. Over the past two weeks, delegates from almost 200 countries focused on Article 6 of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which is about some technical details of the implementation of the deal in building the market mechanisms, especially the global carbon market. ""We want to close Article 6... which will generate resources to bring about projects, and the projects would allow us to move toward sustainable development... The Mechanisms contribute to helping us to move forward,"" said Schmidt. ""Clearly it is said to reach the agreement, but we were so very close. I thank you for your efforts, the long hours and achieving agreement we were on the edge. We have concrete progress on concrete texts to allow us to look ahead with hope,"" according to Schmidt. At the closing plenary, delegates from most countries express their regret or frustration of failing to achieve the agreement on Article 6. The work will be left for further discussion on the next congress COP26, which is scheduled to be held in Glasgow next year. CHINESE EFFORTS In a statement issued after the closing plenary, the Chinese delegation said China played a positive and constructive role during the event. Although the agreement about Article 6 was not reached, China will promote that all parties concerned to reach the consensus as soon as possible. ""The results of the congress are below our expectations, especially that the core issue, talks over the implementation details of Article 6, had reached only a procedural conclusion. I believe that all of us feel regretful, and it cannot match our efforts,"" said Zhao Yingmin, head of the Chinese delegation and vice minister of the Ecology and Environment, at the closing plenary on behalf of the so-called BASIC countries -- China, Brazil, India and South Africa. Zhao also noted that the BASIC countries felt disappointed that developed countries did not answer developing countries' demand for finance. The four countries also expressed regret over the arrangement of pre-2020 implementation and ambition. He urged developed countries to take effective actions to fill the gap of emission cut and the support to developing countries. Zhao said China will work with other parties to address the ""last mile"" of the implementation of Paris Agreement and carry out South-South cooperation on climate change. Participating countries also had differences in the ambitions of addressing climate change, as some countries want to have more ambitious goals, but others want to stick to the goals stipulated in the Paris Agreement. Negotiators took stock of actions and implementation addressing climate change in the pre-2020 period. Climate change adaptation, finance, technological transfers and capacity building have also been discussed. TIME FOR ACTION Among the adopted documents include the ""Chile-Madrid Time for Action"" agreement that lays the groundwork for countries to present more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by 2020 in response to the climate emergency. It expresses the ""urgent need"" for these new commitments by countries to bridge the existing gap with the Paris Agreement target of avoiding a temperature increase of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. According to a statement issued by the Spanish Ministry for the Ecological Transition, COP25 reaffirms the value of multilateralism and international cooperation to solve a global challenge such as climate change. ""Even in complex global contexts, COP25 did not drop the climate agenda in a crucial time for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. On the contrary, it has shown an activist multilateralism,"" said Spanish environment minister Teresa Ribera. The conference shifted from Chile to Spain at the last minute due to unrest in Chile's capital Santiago. Over 26,000 people came to the Spanish capital for the event, including people from NGOs, private sectors and multilateral institutions who promoted global cooperation for addressing climate change, while many climate activists held multiple protests outside the congress venue and in downtown Madrid. "	CCTV

The coronavirus (nCOV-2019) is fast spreading, now to over 20 countries. The fear coronavirus spreads is far bigger than the deaths and infections put together.
But a worse viral load is also somewhere in some other dimension working worse damage to humanity – that is the racism, profiling, hate and alienation of the Chinese person.
The social media in most parts of the world have hundreds of thousands of such hate harvest, most of all from societies that boast they are civilized and know better about what a virus should be and different from a citizen of a country from where a killer virus emanated.
For the coronavirus, China is the epicenter, the birthplace from where the world picks the vibes.
For the hate of it – hatovirus, the human and cultural offshoot of the coronavirus, the outer world is the epicenter. The vector is the media, especially the new media.
While in Europe and the Americas the Asian is the fall guy and ‘demon’ that deliberately created the virus, in Asia, the Chinese is singled out. So pathetic!
It’s quite worrisome that most of the reports about coronavirus induced hate – hatovirus, come from Asian countries close to China. Such news simmers in Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam etc.
The worst of the reported cases was that of Indonesia on Friday, January 31, 2020 that “China flew overseas Hubei residents back to the centre of the outbreak in Wuhan on chartered planes from Thailand and Malaysia, citing “practical difficulties” the passengers had encountered overseas.”. That doesn’t sound cheery or humane.
In Australia, after two media organisations had screamed headlines that were heavily loaded with negativity against the Chinese person, Global Times, a Beijing based media reported angst by 46,000 Chinese citizens who signed a protest against the reports and demanding a recant.
The Global Times report said: “More than 46,000 people have signed a petition demanding the Australian media to apologize publicly for racism against the Chinese community after two media outlets carried headlines and highlighted characters on their front pages which labeled the novel coronavirus-related pneumonia as a “Chinese virus” and hyped sentiments that would require Chinese children to stay at home.
The Australian daily tabloid newspaper, The Daily Telegraph, published on its Wednesday’s paper a report titled “China Kids Stay Home,” according to a photo of the paper circulating online.
The report indicated that the New South Wales government warned “parents not to send their children to school or daycare if they have recently been in China” due to “fears over the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak.”
In reaction to this odd trend, Bloomberg, a US platform captured it aptly that: “Airlines halt flights from China. Schools in Europe uninvite exchange students. Restaurants in South Korea turn away Chinese customers.
“As a deadly virus spreads beyond China, governments, businesses and educational institutions are struggling to find the right response. Safeguarding public health is a priority. How to do that without stigmatizing the entire population of the country where the outbreak began — and where nearly a fifth of all humans reside — is the challenge.”
In the US, a Vietnamese American celebrity, Michelle Phan said she’s been targeted with barrage of racism on twitter amid Wuhan coronavirus scare. And in one of the instances, she replied: ‘Why are some of you telling me to go back to eating bats? I’m American you ignorant f—s.”
There have been many other reported cases of such hate attacks in Canada where the government of Ontario and the school board had to issue warning that no Chinese citizen should be maltreated or stigmatized because of the coronavirus outbreak.
In an interesting contrast, governments of many countries and intergovernmental bodies including the World Health Organisation (WHO), the EU, India, Pakistan, the Vatican through Pope Francis have praised the Chinese authorities for concerted efforts against the scourge and even offered to assist.
Dropping aside the usual antagonism, a US media organization published reports praising China’s openness in managing and reporting the incident and also allowing the outer world to see what it’s doing to curtail the spread especially the WHO that has visited Beijing and interacted with President Xi Jinping. The report noted that this open and transparent approach is a deviation from the way China handled the management of the SARS outbreak in 2003, applauding the positive dimension.
So how do we reconcile a situation where governments praise China and pledge support in this challenging time while the citizens walk in contrary direction, compounding the problem with stigmatization? That becomes a task for the governments to senitise the uninformed citizens to act properly.
However, it’s many thanks to scientists in Australia and Ghana that have assisted with researches that created vaccines against the virus. After Australia announced the breakthrough, Ghana told the world that two students of pharmacy who trained in China when the first minor coronavirus outbreak occurred cloned the virus with samples they obtained in China then and also volunteered to fly to China and assist in fighting this death agent.
Sincerely, if I have the scientific weapon and know-how, I would target to obliterate this virus. Yes, I would rather fight the virus that has traversed continents and nations.
But now, I haven’t the equipment to stop coronavirus from spreading and killing the Chinese mostly, I would readily deploy the little weapon in my hands and within my reach – love, to love the Chinese and not mistake him or her for the virus.
Since the Chinese is NOT the virus, I rather fight the virus by loving and embracing the Chinese. I won’t be fair to him/her and humanity to alienate or profile or castigate the Chinese spared by the virus at a time I should be consoling them for the loss of lives, peace and livelihood.
That is what humanity rightly demands of us.

It’s quite worrisome that most of the reports about coronavirus induced hate – hatovirus, come from Asian countries close to China. Such news simmers in Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam etc. The worst of the reported cases was that of Indonesia on Friday, January 31, 2020 that “China flew overseas Hubei residents back to the centre of the outbreak in Wuhan on chartered planes from Thailand and Malaysia, citing “practical difficulties” the passengers had encountered overseas.”. That doesn’t sound cheery or humane. In Australia, after two media organisations had screamed headlines that were heavily loaded with negativity against the Chinese person, Global Times, a Beijing based media reported angst by 46,000 Chinese citizens who signed a protest against the reports and demanding a recant. The Global Times report said: “More than 46,000 people have signed a petition demanding the Australian media to apologize publicly for racism against the Chinese community after two media outlets carried headlines and highlighted characters on their front pages which labeled the novel coronavirus-related pneumonia as a “Chinese virus” and hyped sentiments that would require Chinese children to stay at home. The Australian daily tabloid newspaper, The Daily Telegraph, published on its Wednesday’s paper a report titled “China Kids Stay Home,” according to a photo of the paper circulating online. The report indicated that the New South Wales government warned “parents not to send their children to school or daycare if they have recently been in China” due to “fears over the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak.” In reaction to this odd trend, Bloomberg, a US platform captured it aptly that: “Airlines halt flights from China. Schools in Europe uninvite exchange students. Restaurants in South Korea turn away Chinese customers. “As a deadly virus spreads beyond China, governments, businesses and educational institutions are struggling to find the right response. Safeguarding public health is a priority. How to do that without stigmatizing the entire population of the country where the outbreak began — and where nearly a fifth of all humans reside — is the challenge.” In the US, a Vietnamese American celebrity, Michelle Phan said she’s been targeted with barrage of racism on twitter amid Wuhan coronavirus scare. And in one of the instances, she replied: ‘Why are some of you telling me to go back to eating bats? I’m American you ignorant f—s.” There have been many other reported cases of such hate attacks in Canada where the government of Ontario and the school board had to issue warning that no Chinese citizen should be maltreated or stigmatized because of the coronavirus outbreak. In an interesting contrast, governments of many countries and intergovernmental bodies including the World Health Organisation (WHO), the EU, India, Pakistan, the Vatican through Pope Francis have praised the Chinese authorities for concerted efforts against the scourge and even offered to assist. Dropping aside the usual antagonism, a US media organization published reports praising China’s openness in managing and reporting the incident and also allowing the outer world to see what it’s doing to curtail the spread especially the WHO that has visited Beijing and interacted with President Xi Jinping. The report noted that this open and transparent approach is a deviation from the way China handled the management of the SARS outbreak in 2003, applauding the positive dimension. So how do we reconcile a situation where governments praise China and pledge support in this challenging time while the citizens walk in contrary direction, compounding the problem with stigmatization? That becomes a task for the governments to senitise the uninformed citizens to act properly. However, it’s many thanks to scientists in Australia and Ghana that have assisted with researches that created vaccines against the virus. After Australia announced the breakthrough, Ghana told the world that two students of pharmacy who trained in China when the first minor coronavirus outbreak occurred cloned the virus with samples they obtained in China then and also volunteered to fly to China and assist in fighting this death agent. Sincerely, if I have the scientific weapon and know-how, I would target to obliterate this virus. Yes, I would rather fight the virus that has traversed continents and nations. But now, I haven’t the equipment to stop coronavirus from spreading and killing the Chinese mostly, I would readily deploy the little weapon in my hands and within my reach – love, to love the Chinese and not mistake him or her for the virus. Since the Chinese is NOT the virus, I rather fight the virus by loving and embracing the Chinese. I won’t be fair to him/her and humanity to alienate or profile or castigate the Chinese spared by the virus at a time I should be consoling them for the loss of lives, peace and livelihood. That is what humanity rightly demands of us.      Source: africachinapresscentre.org"	CCTV

Xinhua journalists have interviewed 18 recovered patients in 13 provincial-level regions in China, summing up several commonalities from their diagnosis and treatment experiences.
BEIJING, Feb. 23 -- Nearly 23,000 patients infected with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) have so far recovered and been discharged from hospitals in China as the country makes progress in its fight against the epidemic.
It is believed to be of great significance to scrutinize diagnosis and treatment plans, summarize experience in those cured cases, and share such information in a timely manner among various parties, in an effort to intensify medical treatment capability and effectively assist in epidemic prevention and control across the country.
Xinhua journalists have interviewed 18 patients (some using only surnames for privacy) recovering from the coronavirus in 13 provincial-level regions in China, summing up several commonalities from their diagnosis and treatment experiences.

EARLY DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT
Early identification, reporting, isolation, diagnosis, and treatment is one of the best and most effective ways to contain pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus.
""I went to the hospital immediately after I had a fever, and was soon diagnosed with COVID-19,"" said a patient in north China's Tianjin Municipality.
With intensive media coverage of the situation, the public has been aware of the urgency. ""Therefore, I went for an examination immediately after symptom onset,"" the patient added. ""I did the right thing as it helped me win very precious time for timely treatment.""
A 35-year-old resident surnamed Tang in east China's Shandong Province, returned to her hometown from Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, on Jan. 22, one day before the megacity, with a population of over 10 million, decided to close all channels of leaving Wuhan to curb the spread of the deadly pathogen.
""I knew the situation in Wuhan would become worse,"" Tang recalled. ""On Feb. 23, I went to the hospital in my hometown and was confirmed to be infected with the virus.""
""Thanks to the early diagnosis, my symptoms were eased a lot after four days of treatment in hospital, and I was finally cured,"" said Tang.
COMBINATION OF TCM, WESTERN MEDICINE
Clinical experience has repeatedly proven that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) combined with Western medicine plays an active and effective role in the treatment and recuperation of coronavirus patients.
TCM and Western medicine have their respective focuses and complementary strengths in treating the novel coronavirus, according to Zhang Boli, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Western medicine offers important life-supporting measures such as respiratory and circulatory assistance, while TCM focuses on improving patients' physical conditions and immune function, said Zhang.
Hu Yaqi, a 26-year-old resident in Wuhan, was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Jan. 24 when she passed by north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region during her train trip. She received the integrated treatment of TCM and Western medicine during her 14-day hospital stay.
Ding, a university student, took two doses of TCM targeting fever, coughing and vomiting twice a day when receiving treatment at the Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province.
""I felt better a couple of days later. The TCM prescription helped a lot in improving my physical conditions and immune function,"" said Ding, who was cured and discharged from hospital on Feb. 9.
Among the 22 recovered patients in the hospital, over 80 percent received the combined treatment of TCM and Western medicine, according to Yu Hong, an attending doctor with the hospital.
Nationwide, over 75 percent of COVID-19 patients are receiving TCM treatment in Hubei and over 90 percent in other parts of China.
STRONG MEDICAL SUPPORT
Strong medical resource support, including excellent medical teams, specific treatment schemes, as well as timely psychological counseling, have been provided for these confirmed cases.
After Li, a 46-year-old teacher in north China's Shaanxi Province, was admitted to hospital on Jan. 28, a medical team consisting of intensive care, infectious and TCM medicines was immediately set up, and a specific treatment plan was quickly formulated.
To quell her fear of the unknown, psychological health services were offered.
""Once we are emotionally unstable, psychological consultants and medics will come to talk with us and cheer us up,"" said Ma Lian, who was hospitalized with her three family members in northwest China's Qinghai Province in late January.
The emotional stability of patients helps in the fight. The psychological counseling offers comfort for those infected and reduces their spiritual burden, according to Drolma, deputy head of the Fourth People's Hospital of Qinghai.
To date, China has opened mental health hotlines for people who need help with psychological issues related to the epidemic. More such telephone- and internet-based counseling services have also been established across the country.
""Trying to stay strong in mind, only in this way can you win the fight against the 'epidemic demon,'"" said the recovered patient from Tianjin.
TRUST AND COOPERATION
""I almost had a nervous breakdown when I was diagnosed with the deadly COVID-19,"" said Su Ya, a university student who was cured at a designated hospital in southwest China's Guizhou Province. ""Looking back, I was very grateful for those medical workers who helped me survive the hard time.""
Su was the first confirmed case in the city of Zunyi in Guizhou. The Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University quickly set up a medical team composed of critical care, respiratory, infectious, and TCM medicines to better provide medical treatment for her.
Seven doctors and dozens of nurses worked non-stop to take good care of Su. ""She trusted us and was very cooperative with our treatment plan, which also gave us great confidence,"" said Ouyang Yao, a respiratory physician at the hospital.
""Those medical workers deserve our heartfelt gratitude. I felt at ease having them around in the hospital,"" smiled Hu, the cured patient in Inner Mongolia.
""Our common enemy is the novel coronavirus. The doctors and nurses fighting on the frontline risk their lives to help us. The least we can do is to give them trust and stand with them,"" said the 46-year-old teacher in Shaanxi.
EMOTIONAL SUPPORT OF FAMILY, FRIENDS
Yang and her 22-year-old daughter were both confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Jan. 24 in Liaoning.
While many hospitalized patients were separated from their families to reduce the risk of infecting them, medics try to keep a family of patients staying together so that they can spiritually support each other during the treatment.
""The hospital arranged my daughter and me to stay in one ward so that we could accompany and encourage each other,"" said Yang. They were admitted to the Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang, and both were discharged from the hospital on Feb. 9.
""I love you. Do not be afraid and stay strong,"" Li, the teacher in Shannxi, cried when she received a WeChat message from her elderly teacher. Also, Li's students and their parents also texted messages and made phone calls to encourage her.
""My classmates donated money to me. Everyone cares about me,"" Li was very touched. ""Their support motivated me to pull through.""
At the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University in east China's Zhejiang Province, Li also shared a ward with her husband. It only took her four days to recover.
""I have trust in the hospital, the doctors, and my beloved one. I am waiting for him to recover and come home soon,"" said Li. As a rising number of patients infected with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) have recovered and been discharged from hospitals in China, it is believed to be of great significance to scrutinize diagnosis and treatment plans, summarize experience in those cured cases, and share such information in a timely manner among various parties.

Speaking exclusively with Xinhua ahead of the Group of 20 (G20) Osaka summit, Kong said that under the current circumstances, all parties involved should make joint efforts, respond positively to the appeals of the international community and strive for more positive outcomes of the summit, slated for June 28-29.
The ambassador urged G20 member states to stay true to their original aspiration and focus on steady economic growth, adding that at present, factors of instability and uncertainty in the world economy are on the rise, while downward pressure is mounting and market confidence remains low.
It is necessary for the Osaka summit to renew its original aspiration, carry forward the spirit of partnership, strengthen policy coordination, reduce the negative effects of policies of various countries, and promote steady growth of the world economy, he said.
The G20 also needs to remain problem-oriented and address the major issues, Kong said, pointing out that the U.S. government has become a major source of disruption to the global economy by engaging in unilateralism and protectionism, wielding the stick of tariffs against other countries and escalating trade frictions with China.
Therefore, Kong said, the Osaka summit should uphold and support multilateralism, oppose unilateralism and protectionism, and play its due role in building and maintaining an open world economy.
The G20 should also continue to shoulder its historical responsibilities by focusing on development, Kong noted, adding that the Osaka summit should accommodate the concerns of developing countries on issues such as sustainable development, infrastructure and digital economy, and promote balanced and inclusive development of the world economy.
As important members of the G20, Kong noted, China and Japan are the world's second and third largest economies respectively, and are also important participants, defenders and beneficiaries of globalization and free trade.
The two countries are economically interdependent to achieve mutual benefits and win-win results, he said, pointing out that China is Japan's largest export market with the trade volume between the two countries exceeding 300 billion U.S. dollars, while Japan's total investment in China amounts to 120 billion dollars with 10-billion-dollar worth of commodities, which are manufactured in China by Japanese companies, being exported to the United States each year.
He said the escalation of U.S.-China economic and trade frictions initiated by Washington has seriously disrupted the industrial chain between China and Japan, as well as that between the two countries and other parts of the world, not only reducing Japanese exports to China, but also weakening the profitability of Japanese enterprises in China and worsening the external economic environment of Japan.
China and Japan should stand on the right side of history, be unafraid of pressure, and look far ahead, said Kong.
Kong said China is ready to support Japan in hosting the summit and work with Japan and other parties to make the summit a success and an effective multilateral platform for global economic governance.
This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and Japan has also entered the Era of Reiwa, said Kong, adding that the China-Japan relations stand at a new historical starting point.
China and Japan, said Kong, should work to enhance political mutual trust, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, consolidate people-to-people friendship, properly manage clear signals of differences, so as to guide the steady and long-term development of bilateral relations.
Pointing out that the current global economic governance is at a critical juncture, Kong said that China and Japan should jointly voice their opposition to unilateralism and protectionism, firmly support the rules-based multilateral trading system, actively lead the regional integration process and jointly build an open world economy.

The Shanghai-London Stock Connect program opened for trading Monday, a new step for China's financial market to further open up to the world. (Xinhua/Han Yan)
BEIJING, June 17 -- The Shanghai-London Stock Connect program opened for trading Monday, a new step for China's financial market to further open up to the world.
 
As the first Chinese company to be listed in Britain via the long-awaited mechanism, the Nanjing-based Huatai Securities priced the Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) issued at the London Stock Exchange at 20.5 U.S. dollars per unit.
 
The company planned to issue 75.01 million GDRs, with potentially more sales from an over-allotment, it said Saturday in a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
 
Zhou Yi, chairman and president at Huatai Securities, said the program enabled the first direct connection between the Chinese and European markets and offered the company an opportunity to enter one of the world's most mature and influential capital markets.
 
""The issuance of GDRs will further facilitate our development in international business and support us to expand our presence in the overseas market,"" Zhou said.
 
With the full exercise of the over-allotment, the listing would be the largest UK listing since 2016 and the largest UK GDR offering since 2012, according to J.P. Morgan, the joint global coordinator, joint bookrunner and sole stabilization agent on the Huatai Securities' listing.
 
Under the Shanghai-London Stock Connect mechanism, Shanghai-listed companies can list on the London Stock Exchange via GDR issuance, while British companies can issue China Depositary Receipts (CDRs) on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
 
A quota system has also been established for the cross-border conversion business in the early stages of the program, according to a joint announcement by the CSRC and the Financial Conduct Authority.
 
Under the system, the quota for eastbound business is set at 250 billion yuan (about 36.26 billion U.S. dollars), while that for westbound business stands at 300 billion yuan.

The launch of the mechanism marks a crucial step in China's capital market opening-up and is a major part of the China-Britain pragmatic cooperation in the financial sector, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said.
 
The mechanism would be of far-reaching significance to expand channels for cross-border investment and fund-raising, boost the development of both countries' capital markets and encourage the building of Shanghai into an international financial hub, the CSRC said in a statement.
 
Calling the move a significant milestone for both China and the UK, J.P. Morgan said it would help expand A-share companies' fund-raising from overseas markets and provide international investors with new access to China's capital markets.
 
The Shanghai-London Stock Connect represents China's latest efforts in the opening-up of its capital markets. Similar stock connect schemes have linked the mainland stock markets with that of Hong Kong.
 
China has notably expanded access to foreign capital from brokerages, with dedication to promoting the internationalization of crude oil, iron ore and PTA in the futures market.
 
Meanwhile, global investors are becoming more and more optimistic about the outlook of the country's A-share market. Following Global index provider MSCI's move to increase index weighting for China A-shares, FTSE Russell is also planning to include A-shares in their global benchmarks.
 
China will soon unveil a series of measures to further open up the capital markets, according to Yi Huiman, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, at the recent Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai.
 
These will include amendments to the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (QFII) scheme and the yuan-denominated RQFII scheme to facilitate more overseas participation in the capital markets.
 
Vowing to ease restrictions on overseas banks' access to the securities investment fund custodian business and to further open up the futures market, the country will allow private equities by overseas fund managers to trade Hong Kong-listed stocks via the stock connect program and facilitate the issuance of yuan-denominated Panda bonds by overseas institutions, Yi said.
 
Besides, the country also plans to expand overseas institutional investors' access to the exchange bond market, he added.

The launch of the mechanism marks a crucial step in China's capital market opening-up and is a major part of the China-Britain pragmatic cooperation in the financial sector, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said.   The mechanism would be of far-reaching significance to expand channels for cross-border investment and fund-raising, boost the development of both countries' capital markets and encourage the building of Shanghai into an international financial hub, the CSRC said in a statement.   Calling the move a significant milestone for both China and the UK, J.P. Morgan said it would help expand A-share companies' fund-raising from overseas markets and provide international investors with new access to China's capital markets.   The Shanghai-London Stock Connect represents China's latest efforts in the opening-up of its capital markets. Similar stock connect schemes have linked the mainland stock markets with that of Hong Kong.   China has notably expanded access to foreign capital from brokerages, with dedication to promoting the internationalization of crude oil, iron ore and PTA in the futures market.   Meanwhile, global investors are becoming more and more optimistic about the outlook of the country's A-share market. Following Global index provider MSCI's move to increase index weighting for China A-shares, FTSE Russell is also planning to include A-shares in their global benchmarks.   China will soon unveil a series of measures to further open up the capital markets, according to Yi Huiman, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, at the recent Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai.   These will include amendments to the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (QFII) scheme and the yuan-denominated RQFII scheme to facilitate more overseas participation in the capital markets.   Vowing to ease restrictions on overseas banks' access to the securities investment fund custodian business and to further open up the futures market, the country will allow private equities by overseas fund managers to trade Hong Kong-listed stocks via the stock connect program and facilitate the issuance of yuan-denominated Panda bonds by overseas institutions, Yi said.   Besides, the country also plans to expand overseas institutional investors' access to the exchange bond market, he added.    "	CCTV

When asked why she came up with such a name, she explained that her surname Lacy sounds like the Chinese character Lei and ""Dorothy"" in Greek means ""God's gift"", which is similar to the meaning of ""Tianci"" in Chinese.  Falling in love with Fenghuang  The first time Dorothy set foot in Fenghuang was on a tour in 1999, and she immediately fell in love with the breathtaking view of the ancient town and its Miao ethnic customs and culture.  The arrival of the new millennium saw Paul and Dorothy decide to form a business and tie the knot in the following year. Then with the help of a Chinese friend, the Lacys finally opened their embroidery workshop in Fenhuang in October 2014.  Thanks to the generous assistance of their local friends, the couple gradually settled down, fit in with the local ethnic community, and got their startup on its feet. The Lacys have lived in Fenghuang for more than 13 years since Paul sold his property in the States in 2006 and purchased a residence on the bank of the Tuojiang River.  Before they settled in Fenghuang, the couple's footsteps were left in vast swaths of China. For example, they traveled to cities, such as Beijing and Xi'an, and provinces like South China's Guizhou and Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.  ""Among all those places we had been to, we liked Fenghuang best for its idyllic setting and the rich customs of the Miao people. In addition, Dorothy found the Xiangxi Miao ethnic clothing uniquely appealing, as she used to major in art and design. But above all, it is the kindness and friendliness of the locals here that attracted us the most,"" Paul said. However, due to language barriers and misunderstandings from the locals, the Lacys had a hard time fitting in at first. They could barely communicate with the locals for they spoke neither English nor Mandarin, but an inscrutable dialect. Therefore, when shopping, they had to show shop owners pictures of what they wanted, used body language, or let an interpreter talk to the shop owner over the phone.  Gradually, their life in Fenghuang got easier thanks to friends' help and the coverage of their stories by local media. In 2015, they were recognized by the local government as one of the top 10 beautiful families in Fenghuang, the couple said. After having inhabited the ancient town for more than a decade, the couple knows Fenghuang well. Aside from a love for its history, food and customs, the couple holds a special love for Miao embroidery, which is one of the main reasons that they chose to make their second home there. The patterns of flowers, birds, and butterflies in Miao embroidery are of bright colors and there are a great number of creative patterns. After they came to Fenghuang, they saw such beautiful handicrafts but that the locals here lead impoverished lives. Then they decided to open a company and set up a factory producing Miao hand embroidery.  In the early days, they invested heavily in market research, pattern collection, and brand building. Now they are quite sanguine about the prospects of the company, whose annual sales are about 1.5 million yuan (roughly $216,000).  In addition to pursuing exquisite quality, they've also integrated modern design elements in the products and sustained Miao traditional embroidery styles. This helps explain why the products are adored by customers, the couple said. Empowering Miao women Inspired by Dorothy's Chinese name, the couple named their company Lacy's God-Given Ethnic Handmade Crafts Co. Plus, they created a website called ""shenaini"", literally meaning ""God love you"", to promote their products around the world.  ""The meaning of my name is 'God's gift' and 'shenaini' means 'God love you' in Chinese, and we believe 'God helps those who help themselves'. The biggest reason for us to stay in Fenghuang is that we want to help lift the locals out of poverty by providing them with satisfying and profitable work. We think we will keep doing this as long as our health permits,"" Dorothy said. Now the Lacy's company has 30 employees, with seven working full-time and 15 or 16 women who work part-time at home. Most of the Miao women who embroider for the company have children, and they can travel to the company once a week to take embroidery materials back home so that they can work while taking care of their families, they said.  The Lacys said that their products have been selling well in the US market because Americans love ethnic handicrafts. They noted that the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008 took a heavy toll on sales. At that time, their customers were largely from South China's Guangdong province and Hong Kong. Now they have two physical stores in Hong Kong and a big one in Chengdu. In the meantime, their products are available on their website, where customers from around the world can buy the exquisite Miao hand embroidery. Generally, customers are mainly foreigners who love Chinese handicrafts. They recall a British woman traveling in Chengdu who bought all of the products in the store. She said she was a collector of Chinese handicrafts and she also wanted to help the locals get out of poverty by buying their products.  The couple has four children and two grandchildren who often receive the embroidered gifts at Christmas and on birthdays. Plus, they often invite their family and friends to Fenghuang, showing them around and taking them to sample local delicacies.  Unlike children in China, those in the US don't have an obligation to provide for their parents. So their children are happy that they've built a new career and strongly support them, they said."	CCTV

VIENTIANE, Aug. 5 -- Rainy season in the Namor District of Oudomxay Province, some 400 km north of the Lao capital Vientiane, is relatively cool in late July, while at the Ban Konlouang Tunnel construction site, located inside mountains there, Chinese workers are sweating.
The 9,020-meter Ban Konlouang Tunnel is the second longest tunnel along the China-Laos railway in northern Laos, which is constructed by China Railway No. 5 Engineering Group (CREC-5).
With harsh geological conditions of faults, underground rivers, water inrush and mud, the tunnel construction site is known as the ""Geological Museum"".
The construction has been listed as a key bottleneck of the railway project.
At the construction site, heat waves erupt from the depth of the tunnel, hitting incomers of the tunnel. In the steamer-like tunnel, even standing still, people can feel sweat dropping down.
When the reporter went into the under-construction tunnel in late July, Wang Hong and his Chinese colleagues were kneeling on an ice pile made up of dozens of large ice blocks.
""The happiest thing in this stuffy tunnel is to take a 10-minute rest on the ice pile,"" Wang Hong said, smearing the sweat off his face. ""Without the ice, I really don't know how to continue with the job.""
According to Wang Hong, the average temperature in the tunnel exceeds 45 degrees centigrade.
In order to keep cool inside the tunnel and create a better construction environment for the workers, the CREC-5 project management has purchased an ice machine, only for providing some five tons of ice every six hours to cool down the construction sites.
""Look, so much water can be squeezed from my clothes,"" the man, in his 40s, said with a light smile, adding that working in the tunnel for 10 minutes will turn the clothes into a ""raincoat"", and working at this environment is prone to serious rheumatism.
Wang Hong, who has been participating in tunnel construction since 1999, has worked in more than 20 tunnels. He said the Ban Konlouang Tunnel of China-Laos railway is the hottest tunnel he has ever worked on and also the tunnel with the most difficulties.
Even so, Wang Hong and his team workers have set a record along the China-Laos railway for the monthly excavation length--186 meters.
After a 10-minute rest, Wang Hong and the workers drank their full kettles of water and then left the ice heap for the tunnel, while another group of Chinese tunnel workers have came.
In the evening, back to the dormitory with Wang Hong and his fellow workers, the reporter found the first thing they did in the dormitory was turning on electric blankets. Although it is relatively cool during rainy season in the year, the temperature at night in Oudomxay can also be around 25 degrees centigrade.
It can not said to be cold, but why do the Chinese tunnel workers turn on the electric blanket?
It turns out that in the rainy season, continuous precipitation not only brings coolness but also dampness. Workers need to prepare electric blankets and spend an hour or so every day to dry up their sheets and quilts.
According to Wang Hong's team worker, Qiu Liping, they are working in the daytime in the tunnel, so they have to prepare electric blankets, instead of dry up the sheets and quilts in the sun.
Qiu Liping said that when waking up in the morning, he can see small drops of water on the quilt because of the recent heavy rains.
""Although the conditions are difficult, joining the Belt and Road construction makes me feel proud. Not only have I enriched my knowledge, but also improved my professional skills,"" said Qiu.
Being the first overseas route connecting with the railway system in China using Chinese technology and equipment, China-Laos railway is a major project in infrastructure inter-connectivity between China and neighboring countries, and a major project in implementing the Belt and Road Initiative.
Ground-breaking ceremony of the railway was held in December 2015, and the construction of the whole route officially started a year later, while the railway is expected to open to traffic in December 2021.
The China-Laos railway has a length of over 414 km with bridges of 62 km, tunnels of 198 km under construction, linking Mohan-Boten border gate in northern Laos and capital Vientiane. Operating speed on the route is designed at 160 km per hour.

""Although the conditions are difficult, joining the Belt and Road construction makes me feel proud. Not only have I enriched my knowledge, but also improved my professional skills,"" said Qiu. Being the first overseas route connecting with the railway system in China using Chinese technology and equipment, China-Laos railway is a major project in infrastructure inter-connectivity between China and neighboring countries, and a major project in implementing the Belt and Road Initiative. Ground-breaking ceremony of the railway was held in December 2015, and the construction of the whole route officially started a year later, while the railway is expected to open to traffic in December 2021. The China-Laos railway has a length of over 414 km with bridges of 62 km, tunnels of 198 km under construction, linking Mohan-Boten border gate in northern Laos and capital Vientiane. Operating speed on the route is designed at 160 km per hour.  "	CCTV

President Xi Jinping delivered a speech to mark the occasion, in which he said that China would keep up with people's ever-growing need for a better life, continue to strive for the complete reunification of the nation, and work to build a shared future for humanity with people from all of the world's countries.
The founding of the People's Republic of China 70 years ago brought to an end China's hundred years of humiliation. Since then, the Chinese people, through concerted effort and hard work, have accomplished achievements on a scale rarely seen before. They've taken the country through a bleak recession to prosperity, and from being almost ""expelled from the earth"" to moving closer and closer to the world's center stage. China has made significant contributions to the peaceful development of humanity, something the 1.4 billion Chinese people should rightfully be proud of.
As the country moves towards the goal of national rejuvenation, its people won't forget how far it has come on its journey, and why it chose to embark on this journey in the very beginning. President Xi's speech sent a clear message about China's determination to embrace the future with the ""Five Adherences"", of which adhering to the leadership of the Communist Party of China, ensuring the principal status of the people, and upholding the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the greatest inspiration it has drawn from its decades of development. As the white paper ""China and the World in the New Era"" recently released by the government makes clear, these are the fundamental factors that lie behind China's success.
The ""Five Adherences"" also includes adherence to the principle of peaceful reunification and ""one country, two systems"", an innovative solution that has been successfully implemented in Hong Kong and Macau. China is capable of maintaining the long-term prosperity and stability of these two special administrative regions. And it will promote the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, and in doing so will heal the scar on the Chinese nation. The reunification of the Chinese nation across the Taiwan Straits is an unstoppable historical trend.
Adherence to a path of peaceful development is a pledge that China has made to the world. It's not merely diplomatic language or makeshift rhetoric. Instead, it's an adamant strategic choice and steadfast commitment that China has made based on its understanding of global trends and its own development goals. It is also a path inspired by the heritage of Chinese civilization. As the Italian historian Davide Rossi has pointed out, China has always opposed hegemonism and power politics and has not interfered in the domestic affairs of other countries. And China will continue to contribute positive energy to the maintenance of world peace and development.
Over the past seven decades, the Chinese nation has united in the face of historic challenges, which include blockades by the West, earthquakes, floods, epidemics, and financial crises. This national unity is a guarantee for future development, as the People's Republic of China forges ahead 70 years on to tackle new challenges. The Chinese people remain faithful to the idea that as long as the nation upholds the ""Five Adherences"", no force can ever stop the Chinese people and the Chinese nation from marching forward. And as China adheres to the principle of peaceful development and win-win cooperation, it is bringing light to world peace and development.

Scientists discover highest energy cosmic gamma rays in Tibet
A joint research team made up of Chinese and Japanese scientists has discovered the highest energy cosmic gamma rays ever observed from an observatory in Tibet, opening a new window to explore the extreme universe.
The energy of the gamma rays is as high as 450 TeV, equivalent to 45 billion times of the energy of X-rays for medical diagnosis, researchers from the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences said at a press conference on Wednesday.

Citing the Paris police department, BFMTV news channel said 48 of the 137 individuals detained remained under police custody. They were suspected of committing violent acts in the fringe of the fresh rally. Police found in their bags materials that could be used as projectiles, including stones, slings and hammers, the report added. French authorities have banned rallies in the landmarked Champs Elysees Avenue and the Arc de Triomphe monument, which often became flashpoint of clashes between the police and protestors in recent protests. Some 30 metro stations were closed and many of shops were barricaded. In Paris, 7,500 police officers have been poured in and armored vehicles were deployed to handle more threats of rioting that, according to the government, risks to taint the social movement's 45th weekend of action, which coincided with a march for the climate and union-led demonstration against the pension reform. After a relatively calm debut, a brief standoff erupted early Saturday morning when anti-riot police fired tear gas to prevent some demonstrators from cruising to adjacent streets. Violence flared up after 1,000 anarchists, known as Black Blocs, infiltrated a march for climate. TV footages showed hooded men wearing in black are smashing a bank's window in the capital's fifth district. A motorcycle and bins were torched, forcing firefighters to intervene. More standoffs were reported as police officers, pelted with projectiles, fired tear gas to disperse the protestors. ""Yellow Vest"" movement, which got its name from the high-visibility vests drivers required to have in their cars, was created on social media November last year to protest against a rise in carbon tax, which Macron said was necessary to combat climate change. It has since turned into a bigger uprising denouncing the president's fiscal and economic policy which protestors say favors the rich. Some of them asked Macron to step down. As the social action has posed a serious challenge to his leadership, the head of state had offered a series of concessions that began with a drop of a planned high fuel tax, which inspired the nationwide uprising. Among other sweeteners, he proposed ""an economic and social emergency plan,"" worth 10 billion euros (11.02 billion U.S. dollars) to boost purchasing power.  "	CCTV

U.S. TYPICAL MAXIMUM-PRESSURE TRICK Ronald Wen, a Hong Kong-based senior banker, said the alleged currency manipulation is a new weapon used by the U.S. in the trade friction with China, sending a signal that the U.S.-waged trade war is being expanded to more fields, including forex and financial markets. The U.S. Treasury designation was seen by analysts as a new excuse for more protectionist measures. The Treasury move reeks of arbitrariness and unilateralism, and will disrupt international trade rules and order as well as dampened investors' confidence, experts said. ""By labeling China a currency manipulator, the U.S. is in fact continuing its maximum-pressure approach in trade talks,"" said Liao Qun, chief economist of the China CITIC Bank International. China and the U.S. have been locked up in drawn-out trade disputes since last year. On Monday, Chinese companies have halted purchases of U.S. farm produce after the U.S. decided to impose additional 10-percent tariffs on 300 billion U.S. dollars worth of Chinese imports, as the U.S. move seriously violated the consensus reached by the two heads of state in Osaka. NO INTENTION TO DEVALUATE CURRENCY China has long been committed to keeping the yuan's exchange rate basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level, the central bank said. The Chinese currency is the strongest among the G20 and is one of the currencies that has seen substantial appreciation. From the beginning of 2005 to June this year, the currency's nominal exchange rate appreciated 38 percent and real exchange rate strengthened 47 percent. Last month, the IMF found in its latest annual assessment that the renminbi exchange rate was broadly in line with fundamentals. From the macro perspective, the yuan's exchange rate is buoyed by the country's sound fundamentals, strong economic resilience, stable fiscal position, controllable financial risks, balanced cross-border capital movement and sufficient foreign exchange reserves. China has no intention to gain trade advantages by devaluing its currency, as the yuan's depreciation cannot necessarily lift exports, said Song Xiangyan, an analyst with the PBOC. A large devaluation probably leads to panic capital outflows and competitive currency devaluation of China's trading partners, which will undermine the country's financial stability and hurt imports, Song added. MARKET-DETERMINED EXCHANGE RATE SYSTEM China will be committed to the promises on exchange rates made at all G20 summits and abide by a market-determined exchange rate system, the PBOC governor Yi Gang said Monday. Refusing competitive devaluation, the country will not resort to exchange rates in handling external uncertainties such as trade disputes, Yi said. Looking ahead, Yi stressed the central bank, together with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, would maintain stability and continuity of the country's foreign exchange management policy and safeguard market entities' legitimate and reasonable demands for using foreign currencies. More efforts will be made to deepen the reform and opening up in the field of foreign exchange, promote the liberalization and facilitation of cross-border trade and investment and better serve the real economy and the country's comprehensive opening up, Yi pledged."

BEIJING, Aug. 29 -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday met with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, and the two leaders expressed their readiness to push forward ties.
""Under the two sides' joint efforts, bilateral ties smoothly realized taking an upturn and scoring consolidation and uplift, and continuously achieved tangible outcomes, during President Duterte's administration over the past three years,"" said Xi, expressing welcome for Duterte's visit.
""At present, the international and regional situations are undergoing profound and complex changes. However, peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit are still an irresistible trend of the times,"" said Xi.
Xi said he is willing to work with Duterte to continue to grasp the trend of the times from a strategic and long-term perspective, leading the sound development of bilateral ties. ""This will not only benefit the two countries and their peoples, but will also add positive energy to regional peace and stability.""
Xi said it is necessary to continue to promote the synergy between the Belt and Road Initiative and the Philippine ""Build, Build, Build"" program, and implement major cooperative projects in such areas as infrastructure construction, industrial parks, telecommunications and energy.
""China is willing to import more high-quality fruits and agricultural products from the Philippines, and will send experts to the Philippines to teach agricultural and fishery technology,"" said Xi.
On issues such as human rights, China will continue to firmly support the Philippines' efforts to safeguard national sovereignty and resist external interference, said the Chinese president.
On the South China Sea issue, Xi said China and the Philippines have been maintaining effective communication.
He said the two sides should set aside disputes, eliminate external interference, and concentrate on conducting cooperation, making pragmatic efforts and seeking development.
Xi said ""as long as the two sides handle the South China Sea issue properly, the atmosphere of bilateral ties will be sound, the foundation of the relationship will be stable, and regional peace and stability will have an important guarantee.""
Both sides can take a ""bigger step"" in the joint development of offshore oil and gas, said Xi.
""The Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea is a pioneering undertaking in establishing rules and regulations in the South China Sea, and China and the Philippines should be committed to promoting the adoption of the COC at an early date,"" said Xi, stressing an early adoption will demonstrate the firm position and positive stance of China and the Philippines to jointly safeguard the long-term stability of the region.
Duterte expressed congratulations on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, saying that China's successful development experience is worth learning from.
""I cherish the close friendship with President Xi,"" he said, adding that China means a lot to the Philippines and developing bilateral ties is a project lasting for generations.
He pledged to meet with Xi frequently, strengthen communication, and jointly promote the sound development of the two countries' ties so as to achieve win-win benefits.
Duterte expressed his hope that China will continue to help the Philippines in economic development and infrastructure construction, and thanked China for support in his country's human rights cause, post-quake reconstruction, and anti-terrorism and anti-narcotics endeavors.
Facts have proven that China is a sincere friend to the Philippines, he said, adding that the Philippines fully respects China's laws and the right to maintain law-based governance on the Hong Kong issue, he said.
Duterte expressed his view that the path to peacefully resolving the South China Sea disputes is through cooperation, rather than confrontation.
Maintaining friendly cooperation as well as peace and stability is in the interests of all the parties in the region, he said, while pledging to speed up joint maritime oil and gas exploration with China.
As the country coordinator for China-ASEAN relations, the Philippines is committed to advancing an early adoption of the Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea with relevant parties, Duterte said.
After the meeting, the two heads of state witnessed a ceremony for the exchange of bilateral cooperation deals.

Wang made the remarks when meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) foreign ministers' meeting and other related meetings.
The various consensus reached by Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump in Osaka, Japan in June set the direction of China-U.S. relations, Wang said.

Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi (L) meets with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Bangkok, Thailand, Aug. 1, 2019. (Xinhua/Zhang Keren)
It is the urgent matter at the moment that the United States meets China halfway to implement the consensus, manage and control the disputes on the basis of mutual respect, expand cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit, and jointly push forward the China-U.S. relationship featuring coordination, cooperation and stability as was agreed by leaders of both countries, Wang said.
Wang recognized Pompeo's recent remarks that although China and the United States have different values, both share common interests, and there is much room for cooperation.
China also believes that both sides should strengthen communication, reduce miscalculation, and seek a win-win situation for both China and the United States as well as for the world at large, which is in the interests of both sides and is also the common expectation of the international community, said Wang.
Both China and the United States should correctly view each other's strategic intentions, Wang said, adding that it is neither fair nor possible to try to obstruct China's development.
China also has the right to develop; its development, with strong endogenous momentum, is peaceful and unstoppable, Wang said.
The two sides should give full play to the strategic leading role of the head of state diplomacy in the China-U.S. relations, make good use of all high-level dialogue mechanisms, strengthen consultations in all fields, and translate into reality the vision of the leaders of the two countries that China and the United States can become cooperative partners, he said.
The two sides should properly handle differences and sensitive issues, the Chinese state councilor said, urging the United States to strictly abide by the one-China principle and the three joint communiques between the two countries and properly handle Taiwan-related issues.
Noting that the two sides should expand cooperation in all fields, Wang hoped that the United States will facilitate personnel exchanges between the two countries rather than create obstacles.
For his part, Pompeo said the recent meeting between the leaders of the two countries pointed out the direction for the future development of the bilateral relations.
Pompeo reaffirmed that U.S. President Donald Trump and the U.S. government have no intention to contain China's development and are willing to cooperate with China in various areas. He hoped that the China-U.S. economic and trade consultations move forward smoothly.
Pompeo said that the U.S. side is committed to the three joint communiques between the two countries and the one-China policy.
The United States supports enhancing the two countries' people-to-people exchanges and is willing to address issues from them, Pompeo said.
Both sides exchanged views on the Korean Peninsula issue. Wang said that China supports the important consensus reached by the leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the United States at their summit in Singapore on the complete denuclearization and establishment of a peace mechanism on the peninsula.
China hopes both the DPRK and the United States will seize the opportunity to meet each other halfway and accommodate each other's concerns in a bid to formulate a feasible roadmap and promote the political solution of the Korea Peninsula issue by taking phased and synchronized steps, Wang said.
China is willing to give support and assistance to restart the DPRK-U.S. consultations, he added.
Pompeo said the United States is ready to implement the agreement reached by the leaders of the two countries in the Panmunjom meeting and restart the working level contacts with the DPRK anytime.
With regard to the South China Sea issue as well as issues related to Xinjiang and Hong Kong, Wang urged the U.S. side to respect China's core interests and major concerns, and be prudent in words and deeds.
Both sides agreed to maintain contact on issues of mutual concern.

The planned meeting was announced at a time when the former justice secretary David Gauke said Sunday he believed the national interest would come first if he faced deselection for opposing a no-deal Brexit.
Gauke said he hoped Johnson would not follow through with reported threats that any Conservative member of parliament who voted against the government next week would face deselection at the next election.
""Sometimes there is a point where ... you have to judge between your own personal interests and the national interest. And the national interest has to come first,"" he told Sky News's Sophy Ridge.
Gauke is one of several ministers who resigned from the cabinet after Johnson became prime minister and is among a number of ex-cabinet ministers who will back moves in parliament next week to legislate against no deal.
Philip Hammond, former chancellor of the exchequer, is reported to be among the Brexit rebels to meet with the prime minister, ahead of parliament's return on Tuesday.
Hammond had previously said plans to withdraw the whip from Conservative members of parliament if they vote against the government's policy on Brexit were ""staggeringly hypocritical"" given that eight members of the current cabinet had defied the party whip this year.
A cross-party alliance of members of parliament opposed to no deal are expected to begin moves on Tuesday to table a bill mandating Johnson to ask the European Union (EU) for a further extension to the UK's EU membership.
Also on Sunday, EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier insisted in his article published in the London-based Sunday Telegraph that the Irish border backstop must stay, meaning his rejection of Johnson's request to the EU that the backstop arrangement must be ditched if a no-deal Brexit was to be avoided.
Johnson, who vowed to take his country out of the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a deal, has demanded that the backstop, a Brussels-insisted mechanism to ensure there is no hard border on the island of Ireland, must go as part of a new Brexit deal.
Members of parliament will return to Westminster on Tuesday after their long summer recess, with an attempt expected to be made to win support for legislation to prevent UK from leaving the EU on deadline date, Oct. 31, unless there is a deal in place with Brussels.
Thousands of demonstrators on Saturday took to the streets across Britain in protest against the prime minister's decision to suspend parliament.
Protesters gathered in dozens of locations around the country including London, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham, Brighton, Swansea, Bristol and Liverpool.

By CCTV.com reporter Zhou Fujing
The Fourth China-Arab States Expo, themed ""New Opportunities, New Future,"" opened in Yinchuan, the capital city of northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region on September 5.
The four-day expo includes eight exhibitions, displays and trade promotions, four summits and forums, and the promotion of Jiangsu Province. These activities demonstrate China and Arab countries’ cooperation and achievements in trade, cross-border e-commerce, intelligence manufacturing, infrastructure construction, agricultural cooperation and healthcare industry.
The fourth expo attracts the participation of 12,600 guests, including governmental officials, business people and representatives from international organizations or commerce chambers, from 89 countries, the largest scale since it was first held in 2013. It serves as an important platform that facilitates economic cooperation between China and Arab States and others taking part in the Belt and Road Initiative. The expo has been widely recognized and praised. 
World voices
Boydiel Houmeid, vice president of the National Assembly of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, addressed at the opening ceremony. He said, “The Mauritania National Assembly will firmly carry out the agreements reached by the two countries. Mauritania and China will usher in a new cooperation era with the ever-increasing economic and high-tech competitiveness. Arab people are willing to take part in cooperation and are looking forward to establishing an international cooperation mode that is free from exterior interference and based on mutual understanding, mutual respect and win-win.”
Iro Sani, first vice-President of the National Assembly of the Republic of Niger addressed at the opening ceremony. He said, “The international relations are now dominated by the US-China trade crisis and the safety crisis that has spread across the world. Though, China’s relations with developing countries, particularly the African countries, continue to deepen. The expo is a best proof. In recent years, China has become Niger’s largest investor and participant in public projects and Niger’s second largest trade partner. Thanks to the cooperation, Niger has possessed its own advanced infrastructures, including an international-level hospital, a joint petroleum enterprise which integrates exploitation, transportation and extraction, and a large power plant.”
Ahcène Boukhelfa, Algerian ambassador to China, said, “The expo will benefit Ningxia and will also bring interests for enterprises from both China and Arab States. It has contributed to the increasing of the bilateral China-Arab States trade volumes.”
Shi Taifeng, secretary of the CPC Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee said in his speech, “Ningxia will further open and make smooth the air, land and online passages to Arab countries, further improve the China-Arab capacity cooperation and technology cooperation mechanism, expand the cooperation in the fields of economy and trade, high technology, energy, agriculture and tourism.” 
Zhong Shilong, deputy director-general of the Information Development Bureau of the Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, said in his address at the Online Silk Road 2019 Conference, “Until now, China, together with seven countries, has launched the ‘Belt and Road’ Digital Economy International Cooperation Initiative and has signed the ‘Digital Silk Road’ Construction and Cooperation Memorandum with 16 Belt and Road countries, to further advance the China-Arab States online Silk Road construction.”
Outcomes
The Third China-Arab States Technology Transfer Center and Innovation Cooperation Conference, one of the events at the expo, released 10 achievements in high-tech cooperation on September 5. They include the agricultural drones and agricultural production cloud platform monitoring system as well as the aviation flight and meteorological monitoring and warning system.

The third China-Arab States Business Summit, another event, released the Development Process of China-Arab States Economic and Trade Relation Annual Report 2018 and the Research Report on the Third-Party Market Cooperation Opportunities between China and Arab Countries.  By CCTV.com reporter Zhou Fujing The Fourth China-Arab States Expo, themed ""New Opportunities, New Future,"" opened in Yinchuan, the capital city of northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region on September 5. The four-day expo includes eight exhibitions, displays and trade promotions, four summits and forums, and the promotion of Jiangsu Province. These activities demonstrate China and Arab countries’ cooperation and achievements in trade, cross-border e-commerce, intelligence manufacturing, infrastructure construction, agricultural cooperation and healthcare industry. The fourth expo attracts the participation of 12,600 guests, including governmental officials, business people and representatives from international organizations or commerce chambers, from 89 countries, the largest scale since it was first held in 2013. It serves as an important platform that facilitates economic cooperation between China and Arab States and others taking part in the Belt and Road Initiative. The expo has been widely recognized and praised.  World voices Boydiel Houmeid, vice president of the National Assembly of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, addressed at the opening ceremony. He said, “The Mauritania National Assembly will firmly carry out the agreements reached by the two countries. Mauritania and China will usher in a new cooperation era with the ever-increasing economic and high-tech competitiveness. Arab people are willing to take part in cooperation and are looking forward to establishing an international cooperation mode that is free from exterior interference and based on mutual understanding, mutual respect and win-win.” Iro Sani, first vice-President of the National Assembly of the Republic of Niger addressed at the opening ceremony. He said, “The international relations are now dominated by the US-China trade crisis and the safety crisis that has spread across the world. Though, China’s relations with developing countries, particularly the African countries, continue to deepen. The expo is a best proof. In recent years, China has become Niger’s largest investor and participant in public projects and Niger’s second largest trade partner. Thanks to the cooperation, Niger has possessed its own advanced infrastructures, including an international-level hospital, a joint petroleum enterprise which integrates exploitation, transportation and extraction, and a large power plant.” Ahcène Boukhelfa, Algerian ambassador to China, said, “The expo will benefit Ningxia and will also bring interests for enterprises from both China and Arab States.

Noting that this year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and next year will mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the UN, Zhang said that China's cooperation with the organization is ""standing at a new starting point.""

Britain's highest court, the Supreme Court in London, is hearing two separate appeals linked to the way Johnson prorogued, or suspended parliament for five weeks.
Hours after the British government's own lawyer in the case argued that legal cases from the past showed the suspension of parliament had been used by British governments to gain a legislative and political advantage.
James Eadie, the barrister representing the British government argued that courts do not have the right to rule the suspension of parliament unlawful because Johnson was using a prerogative power that is not subject to an adjudication by the courts.
Aidan O'Neill, representing Joanna Cherry, MP for the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP), used his closing speech to attack Johnson.
Cherry and the other parliamentarians first took the case to the Scottish Court of Session, the highest court in Scotland which ruled that the suspension of the British Parliament by Johnson had been unlawful.
In a reference to Johnson, he told 11 of the most senior judges in Britain: ""Rather than allowing lies to triumph, listen to the angels of your better nature and rule that this prorogation is unlawful and an abuse of power which has been entrusted to the government.""
He said Johnson's government was showing itself unworthy of trust as it used the powers of its office in a manner that is corrosive of the constitution and destructive of the system of parliamentary representative democracy on which the polity of the UK is founded.
O'Neill said it appeared the prime minister's actions in proroguing parliament has had the intent and effect of preventing parliament, impeding parliament, from holding the government politically to account at a time when the government is taking decisions which will have constitutional and irreversible impacts on the country.
Legal and media commentators following the case described O'Neill's speech as the most passionate and outspoken of the four submissions heard so far by the court.
The court will conclude the case Thursday, with a ruling to come later.
Meanwhile Simon Byrne, the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland, said Wednesday his police officers could be killed if they had to patrol checkpoints along the border with the Irish Republic in the event of a hard Brexit.
Byrne told the London-based Guardian newspaper he opposed officers having to patrol checkpoints on a physical border, adding his officers who were already under huge strain would be placed in danger policing any checkpoints.
Byrne said: ""People do not want a return to the images of 20-30 years ago, where history shows us that far more police officers and 20,000 soldiers could not protect the border, so I doubt we are going to do it now.""
He described how the 500-kilometer border was porous, with half a field in one country, and half in another.
They want to carry on with the fact they can take the kids to school without going through checkpoints and all that sort of anxiety.
He warned there could be ""civil protest where people from the farming community, for example, block roads.
""We are also looking at the potential for protest in different forms, depending on which community sees Brexit in terms of winners and losers,"" added Byrne.

Such a move would be ""mostly a symbolic gesture"" that cannot cause ""significant ramifications"" against China, and the intensifying trade war would hamper U.S. and global growth momentum, according to some U.S. financial professionals and scholars.
U.S. LABELING A SYMBOLIC GESTURE
The U.S. Treasury has designated China as a currency manipulator, citing the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. Under the law, the treasury should initiate negotiations first through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or bilaterally, which normally takes a year.
""Opening an investigation through the IMF is mostly symbolic as the IMF is unlikely to declare China as a currency manipulator,"" said a group of economists at Bank of America (BofA) Merrill Lynch in a report on Tuesday.
There is the potential for the U.S. administration ""to invoke other trade laws, but they would also be generally symbolic with few significant ramifications,"" said the BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research report.
That's because the IMF estimated that the Chinese currency was appropriately valued relative to fundamentals, while the U.S. dollar was 6-12 percent overvalued in a report last month.
""In the meantime, the question is what this means for the likelihood that the U.S. will take steps to intervene in the FX (foreign exchange) market and weaken the dollar in response,"" said the economists.
In this regard, Jeffrey Sachs, a senior United Nations advisor and renowned economics professor at Columbia University, held that the weakening of the CNY does not suggest China is manipulating its currency.
""This is true even according to the arbitrary standards of America's own trade laws, much less according to objective standards,"" Sachs said in a published article on Tuesday.
He further pointed out that the U.S. Treasury acknowledged in its report in May that China does not meet the criteria of a currency manipulator, because there is no sign China tried to expand its current account surplus through currency manipulation and the country's foreign exchange reserves have been stable for the past two years.
The Treasury's reversal yesterday is arbitrary, just as the U.S. imposition of new tariffs against China was last week, said the scholar.
Similarly, investment strategists with the Swiss investment bank UBS also cautioned in a research report on Tuesday against framing the depreciation of the CNY as the start of a competitive devaluation, as the yuan's fall reflected ""worsening economic fundamentals and rising trade tariff risks.""
They also mentioned that Chinese policymakers appeared ""wary of unhinging expectations for yuan stability,"" because Beijing ""is well aware of the negative costs linked to currency depreciation, from capital markets to capital outflows.""
""We would view Monday's moves as a reminder that the yuan exchange rate may reflect external headwinds, rather than the start of a competitive devaluation policy,"" they said.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC), or China's central bank, said Tuesday that China will not use the currency as a tool to deal with trade disputes and the U.S. label does not meet the quantitative criteria for the so-called ""currency manipulator"" set by the U.S. Treasury.
""Though the U.S. has continued to escalate the trade dispute since early 2018, China has kept its promise of not carrying out competitive devaluation. China has never used and will not use the RMB exchange rate as a tool to deal with the trade frictions,"" the PBOC said in an online statement.
Although the CNY would be under downward pressure in the short term because of the ongoing trade war, it still has some space to fluctuate, Tim Fang, head of global markets of Hong Kong-based investment bank AMTD International, told Xinhua on Monday.
""I believe in PBOC's capability (in keeping the yuan stable). I'm not very concerned,"" he said.
RISING TRADE WAR TO HAMPER GROWTH POTENTIAL
The current developments over tariffs and currency would ""present a significant headwind for global growth, corporate profits, and markets,"" said UBS strategists.
The ""unexpected"" U.S. labeling has caught global financial markets off guard, fueling market panic over a long-term U.S.-China trade dispute, Fang said.
""It is irresponsible of the U.S. administration to designate China as a currency manipulator,"" Fang said. ""The U.S. government once took the initiative to depreciate the U.S. dollar to incentivize economic recovery, especially after the financial crisis. But it was seldom questioned.""
What's worse, Steven Gu, a Tennessee-based attorney and certified public accountant, told Xinhua that he remained gravely concerned over the global economic growth potential, as the U.S.-China trade war has deteriorated at a much faster speed that exceeded most people's expectations.
U.S. financial services firm Moody's also said in a note that the escalation of trade tensions would increasingly weigh on the global economy and supply chains ""in an environment of already decelerating growth in the U.S., the euro area and China, with the uncertainty dampening business investment and trade flows.""
An extended period of trade conflicts could cause ""more downward pressure on global trade and growth momentum,"" said BofA Merrill Lynch economists, adding that there would be greater uncertainty that weighs on business investment, and tighter financial conditions if markets continue to react negatively.
""With no end in sight, there are significant downside risks to our forecasts for U.S. and global growth. If the trade war escalates -- this could include a more explicit currency war -- uncertainty would be considerably higher and financial conditions much tighter,"" they cautioned.
""Consumers will also be hit more directly from this latest round of tariffs since there is a greater share of consumer goods in this basket of imports,"" they added.
More significantly, from Sachs' perspective, U.S. protectionist policies represent ""the biggest threat"" to the global open system in modern times, as international trade is based on a mutually beneficial, not winner-or-loser mentality.
""Trade wars are bad, and easy to lose. In fact, everybody is losing,"" Sachs wrote.

Turkey's top electoral body ruled on Monday to scrap after complaints of corruption the result of the March 31 local elections in the country's biggest city, lost by Erdogan's candidate, and decided for a fresh Istanbul mayoral contest on June 23.
 
Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), whose candidate Ekrem Imamoglu had narrowly won the first vote, condemned the ruling and vowed to re-win in the June vote.
 
The party also ruled out on Tuesday a boycott of the fresh elections, suggested by some observers and party members.
 
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) had appealed for an election re-run after weeks of debate, controversy and several recounts showed that it had lost control of Istanbul for the first time in 25 years, an unexpected defeat for Erdogan who was the mayor of the populous city in the 1990s.
 
Footage on social media showed hundreds of protesters took to the streets in different neighborhoods of Istanbul late Monday, chanting slogans against the government and elections authorities while some residents beat pots and pans in sign of protest.

Imamoglu made a strong speech to several thousand supporters after his mandate was annulled, emphasizing that he will not bow down.
 
""We will never compromise on our principles,"" he told the crowd, adding ""we will win again and we will fight until the last moment.""
 
The election board's decision to renew Istanbul elections has meanwhile dealt a fresh blow to the already vulnerable Turkish currency lira, sending it to the lowest point in seven months. The lira was trading Tuesday afternoon at 6.14 against U.S. dollar.
 
Erdogan is still the most popular leader of the NATO country, but economic woes affecting Turkey since a currency meltdown last summer have triggered a recession, the first in a decade, eroding some of his support in big cities, where rising inflation and unemployment are a major concern.
 
In the first reaction after Monday's much-awaited decision, the Turkish strongman defended the re-run of Istanbul election.
 
Speaking at a parliamentary meeting of his party, Erdogan said that re-doing the vote was the ""best step"" for the country.
 
""We see this decision as the best step that will strengthen our will to solve problems within the framework of democracy and law,"" he said.
 
The Turkish president insisted there was ""illegality"" in the vote and said a re-run would represent ""an important step to strengthen our democracy.""
 
Istanbul with 15 million residents is particularly crucial for Erdogan as it accounts for a third of Turkey's economy and is the true economic powerhouse of Turkey, controlling a major chunk of public spending.
 
Erdogan himself said prior to the elections that ""whoever wins Istanbul, wins Turkey,"" indicating that he would not take a defeat in this home city lying down.
 
""We will knock on everybody's door until June 23 and win their hearts, especially those who preferred not to vote for us or who abstained for some reason,"" said an AKP official to Xinhua, pointing out that his party is as much resolved as the opposition to win Istanbul.

And to win, Erdogan could have more than one card up his sleeve, according to unconfirmed reports moving around in political circles in Ankara.
 
He may well use the ""Kurdish vote"" to win as for the first time in years. The jailed leader of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), Abdullah Ocalan, was granted access to his lawyers and conveyed a statement to the public on Monday, just hours before the Istanbul elections were annulled.
 
This has been seen as Erdogan's intention to recapture Istanbul by pacifying the city's Kurdish opposition, who, according to surveys, voted largely for Imamoglu.
 
""People who didn't vote for the CHP or abstained for some reason will, I think, support Imamoglu like some voters of AKP would do who think that he was unjustly treated,"" said political analyst and Sozcu daily columnist Deniz Zeyrek to Xinhua.
 
""A new defeat would be even more difficult for Erdogan who has created a leader in the person of Imamoglu who can challenge him in the future for the post of president as the opposition seems consolidated,"" argued Zeyrek, adding that Imamoglu had reached out beyond his base and this feature would widen his win in the re-run.

The South Korean navy said in a statement that it would stage the ""territory defense exercises"" in the East Sea from Sunday to Monday.
Participating in the maritime drills in the eastern waters would be battleships from the navy and the coast guard, warplanes from the navy and the air force, and service members from the army and the marine corps.
Given the meaning and scale, the drills were named as the ""East Sea territory defense exercises"" instead of Dokdo defense exercises, the navy noted.
The South Korean maritime forces had conducted the defense drills on and around the country's easternmost islets of Dokdo, called Takeshima in Japan, twice a year, mostly in June and December.
This year's drills were delayed amid the rising trade spat between South Korea and Japan and the controversy over historical issues.
South Korea on Thursday terminated the GSOMIA, which was signed in November 2016 with Japan to share military intelligence on nuclear and missile programs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
The termination came as Japan removed South Korea earlier this month from its whitelist of trusted trading partners that are given preferential export procedure. In response, Seoul dropped Tokyo off its whitelist of trusted export partners.
Last month, Japan tightened regulations on its export to South Korea of three materials vital to produce memory chips and display panels, triggering the trade dispute between the two countries.
Japan's export curbs came in an apparent protest against the South Korean top court's ruling that ordered some of Japanese companies, including Nippon Steel and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries among others, to pay compensation to the South Korean wartime forced labor victims.
Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans were forced by Imperial Japan into hard labor without pay during World War II. The Korean Peninsula was colonized by Japan from 1910 to 1945.

After an informal welcome at the landmark lighthouse overlooking the extremely heavily secured small town, French President Emmanuel Macron and his guests -- Angela Merkel (Germany), Boris Johnson (Britain), Justin Trudeau (Canada), Giuseppe Conte (Italy), Shinzo Abe (Japan) and Donald Trump (the United States) -- will strive to search for common ground amid worsening divergency in next two days.
Tough issues piled on the agenda: tightened trade tensions, trans-Atlantic relations at historical low, climate challenges with unprecedented fires in Amazon rainforest, Brexit with a highly probable scenario of no-deal, Iran nuclear deal at stake, Russia-Europe relations as well as digital taxation dividing not only Brussels and Washington but also members within Europe, just to name a few.
""This meeting is useful, important ... otherwise we would have to divide among ourselves,"" said Macron in a televised speech earlier in the day.
Conflicts relating ""Iran, Syria, Libya, Ukraine and several other international crisis"" will be discussed. ""Tensions, especially commercial ones, are bad for everyone. We must succeed in reaching a de-escalation, stabilise things and avoid this trade war which is already taking place everywhere,"" he added.
On climate and biodiversity, Marcon urged the summit to answer the emergency calls of the ocean and the forests burning in Amazon while regretting the division between Europe and the U.S.
The trans-Atlantic rift cuts even deeper days ahead of the summit as Trump offered to buy Denmark's Greenland and, when rejected, called the Danish prime minister's statement ""nasty"" and cancelled, via a tweet, his planned visit to the European country.
On the eve of the summit he reiterated criticism of a French proposal to levy a tax aimed at big U.S. technology companies and threatened again to retaliate by taxing French wine. Last month, he blasted Macron's ""foolishness"" in a tweet.
EU will respond in kind if Trump slaps tariffs on French wine, warned Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, in his pre-summit briefing earlier this morning.
""If Trump uses tariffs for political reasons, it could be dangerous for the whole world, including the EU,"" he added. ""Trade wars among G7 members will lead to eroding the already weakened trust among us.""
""It is increasingly difficult, for all of us, to find common language and the world needs more of our cooperation, not less,"" he said, adding ""this may be the last moment to restore our political community.""
Upon arrival at Biarritz airport, Johnson also said he would be telling Trump to pull back from a trade war which is already destabilising economic growth around the world.
""I am very worried about the way it's going, the growth of protectionism, of tariffs that we're seeing,"" he told reporters.
""Trump would not expect any kind of warm welcome in Biarritz. He does not really care much about G7. He is very much defiant to all international bodies in in general, and he knew in the first place that other leaders in the G7 would be very much opposed to him,"" Remi Bourgeot, an economist and associate fellow at The French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs (IRIS), told Xinhua.
At noon, Marcon and Trump had an unscheduled work lunch. Hours later, European leaders Merkel, Macron, Tusk, Johnson and Conte held a pre-summit coordinating meeting.
On Sunday, leaders of the G7, partner countries and international organizations invited by France will start their work sessions. Presentation of a report on equality, work sessions on climate and bilateral meetings are programmed.
On Sunday evening, the heads of the delegations will pose for their traditional family photo. They will give a concluding press conference on Monday afternoon.
Last year's Quebec summit in Canada ended without a communique, the first time in G7's history since 1975. Trump put the group's solidarity at question by leaving early.
In 2017 the summit in Italy ended with stalemate over Paris climate accord. Weeks later, Trump pulled the U.S. out of the agreement.
Foreseeing the rowing pals would not reach any substantial consensus, the French presidency had stressed on the ""very informal"" character of the gathering.
""We will talk about strategic issues of security, trade and world economy in a very informal way. We will see whether there is question of issuing communique,"" Macron told media earlier this week.
About 30 km away from Biarritz, alter-globalisation activists are organizing their counter-summit on the French-Spanish border. On Friday night, protesters clashed with the security forces, resulting in 17 arrests and several police lightly wounded.
To neutralize all violent protests is one of the top priorities of the heavily armed security forces, including 13,200 paramilitary, according to the French authorities. BIARRITZ, France, Aug. 24 -- Leaders from the world's seven most industrialized countries started the divided group's 45th summit, clouded by a pile of tough issues with trade tensions high on agenda, on Saturday evening at the French seaside resort Biarritz. After an informal welcome at the landmark lighthouse overlooking the extremely heavily secured small town, French President Emmanuel Macron and his guests -- Angela Merkel (Germany), Boris Johnson (Britain), Justin Trudeau (Canada), Giuseppe Conte (Italy), Shinzo Abe (Japan) and Donald Trump (the United States) -- will strive to search for common ground amid worsening divergency in next two days. Tough issues piled on the agenda: tightened trade tensions, trans-Atlantic relations at historical low, climate challenges with unprecedented fires in Amazon rainforest, Brexit with a highly probable scenario of no-deal, Iran nuclear deal at stake, Russia-Europe relations as well as digital taxation dividing not only Brussels and Washington but also members within Europe, just to name a few. ""This meeting is useful, important ... otherwise we would have to divide among ourselves,"" said Macron in a televised speech earlier in the day. Conflicts relating ""Iran, Syria, Libya, Ukraine and several other international crisis"" will be discussed. ""Tensions, especially commercial ones, are bad for everyone. We must succeed in reaching a de-escalation, stabilise things and avoid this trade war which is already taking place everywhere,"" he added.

CAIRO, June 17 -- Egypt's former President Mohamed Morsi died on Monday in court after the conclusion of a trial session in an espionage lawsuit, the state TV reported.
 
""The former president had asked to speak and the judge gave him the permission,"" said the state TV.
 
Morsi fainted later and his body was taken to hospital, it added.
 
Local media said the former president suffered a heart attack.
 
He had been attending a retrial session in Cairo criminal court along with 22 other people.
Nabil Sadek, the public prosecutor, said in a statement that Morsi collapsed in a defendants' cage in the courtroom after speaking for five minutes and was pronounced dead in hospital at 4:50 p.m. local time (1450 GMT).
 
""The initial medical examination of Morsi showed that he had no pulse, no indications of breathing and his eyes were open and unresponsive to light or stimuli,"" the statement said.
 
An autopsy showed no signs of recent injury on his body, Sadek said.

Sadek has ordered examination of Morsi's body, the check of footage from surveillance cameras at the court, as well as investigation of those who were present at the time of the former president's death.
 
According to informed judicial sources, Morsi was treated in accordance with the law while in detention, and was being examined by doctors on a regular basis, state-run Ahram website reported.
 
Morsi, 67, who took office in 2012, was ousted by the army in 2013 in response to mass protests against his rule.
 
Since then, Morsi and top leaders of his Muslim Brotherhood group have been kept in prison, facing trials over charges of murder, violence and spy.

Morsi was serving a 20-year jail sentence for inciting deadly clashes between his supporters and opponents in late 2012, and a 25-year jail term for leaking classified documents to Qatar. He denied all these charges.
 
The Muslim Brotherhood has been outlawed by the Egyptian government since 2014.

A bid by delegates to force Labour to back Britain remaining in the European Union (EU) ahead of a likely snap general election failed in a controversial vote in the conference hall.
Conference delegates agreed a Corbyn-backed proposition that will see Labour postponing a decision on Brexit until after a general election.
It meant party members endorsing Corbyn's stance to stay neutral while negotiating a new deal if Labour wins the next election. The party would then put the deal to a new referendum, with an option to stay in the EU on the ballot paper.
""We would put both views and say look, this is the best deal we could get; this is the remain and hopefully reform option. These are the choices before you,"" said Corbyn.
While Corbyn's name echoed around the chamber from a chorus of supporters, there were howls of protests arguing that the vote had been too close to call. The chair of the proceedings faced calls for a recount.
There were calls for a card vote from some in the hall -- a formal ballot which is held at Labour conferences when votes are seen to be close. However, these calls were in vain and the proceedings moved on.
Conference chair Wendy Nichols ruled that the show of hands indicated the call for an immediate remain stance on Brexit had been lost.
The Guardian in London commented that if the remainers call for the party to immediately campaign for Remain, it would have been seen by the media as a terrible defeat for Corbyn.
The Guardian commented that remainers think Labour will haemorrhage votes to the Liberal Democrats and the Greens at the general election under Corbyn policy that will now remain unchallenged until the election.
""The Corbynites think turning Labour into a remain-only party would be even more disastrous. There is no way of knowing which analysis is more correct,"" added the commentary.
While the conference decision has clarified the main opposition approach to the Brexit impasse, there was criticism of the vote away from Brighton.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he did not believe the decision reflected the views of the overwhelming majority of Labour members ""who desperately want to stop Brexit.""

Michael Gove, the cabinet minister tasked by Prime Minister Boris Johnson with preparing for a no-deal departure by Britain from the European Union, commented after details from the dossier were published in London by the Sunday Times.
The Times said the report has been compiled by the Cabinet Office and offered a rare glimpse into the covert planning being carried out by the government to avert a catastrophic collapse in the nation's infrastructure.
The confidential report, codenamed Operation Yellowhammer, warned of shortages of foods and medicines, with food prices rising. It also said Britain could face months of disruption at its seaports after a no-deal Brexit. It also spoke of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after plans to avoid checks fail, sparking protests.
There would also be the possibility of delays at EU airports, the Channel Tunnel and at Dover, the main port from Britain for mainland Europe.
Gove said the government study was old, and since Johnson took over at 10 Downing Street, planning for a no-deal Brexit has been accelerated.
He added that very significant steps have been taken in the last three weeks to accelerate Brexit planning.
Gove, in a message on his social media website, said: ""We don't normally comment on leaks - but a few facts - Yellowhammer is a worst case scenario. Very significant steps have been taken in the last three weeks to accelerate Brexit planning.""
Interviewed by journalists outside his London home, Gove said: ""It's certainly the case that there will be bumps in the road, some element of disruption in the event of no-deal. But the document that has appeared in the Sunday Times was an attempt, in the past, to work out what the very, very worst situation would be so that we could take steps to mitigate that. And we have taken steps.""
The Daily Telegraph said it had been told by Downing Street that the dossier had been leaked by a former minister in an attempt to influence discussions with EU leaders.
Later this week Johnson is to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, with media reports in London saying he will insist there must be a new Brexit deal to avert a no-deal Brexit.
The minority Liberal Democrats said the Operation Yellowhammer documents revealed that a no-deal Brexit had ""wartime implications, in peacetime, all of them self-inflicted"".
Tom Drake, the party's Brexit spokesman at Westminster, said: ""People will be horrified that Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are willing to pursue a plan that will lead to shortages of medicines, food and fuel.""

Voting among 160,000 Conservative Party members closed at 5 p.m. local time, just hours after Foreign Office Minister Sir Alan Duncan resigned his government job in protest against Boris Johnson likely to be the person to enter 10 Downing Street.
Other senior ministers, including Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond and Justice Secretary David Gauke have both said publicly they would resign if Johnson is declared the winner on Tuesday.
Party officials will count the votes from around the country during the night before the results expected on Tuesday.
Wednesday is already lined up as an historic day in British politics, with Theresa May making her last ever appearance at Prime Minister's Question Time in the House of Commons. She is also expected to make a farewell speech.
Early Wednesday afternoon May will travel to Buckingham Palace to offer her resignation as prime minister to Queen Elizabeth. An hour later the winner of the leadership contest will also travel to the palace to be appointed as prime minister by the British monarch.
The winner will then head to 10 Downing Street where a speech will be made in front of one of the world's most famous front doors at around 5 p.m.
The Daily Telegraph reported Monday that should Johnson win, his girlfriend Carrie Symonds will not join him for his big moment entering Downing Street as prime minister.
The Telegraph said Johnson will enter his new home alone as Symonds does not want to become a distraction ""on the most important day of his life"".
During early Wednesday evening the new prime minister is expected to start the task of assembling a new cabinet, with the great offices of state, foreign secretary, home secretary and defense secretary all likely to be among the first to be appointed.
The handing out of jobs, ranging from secretaries of state to junior ministers is expected to take several days before the full team is finalized.
Political commentators say one of the problems for Johnson to navigate, if he wins the contest, will be the arrival of heavyweights such as Hammond, Gauke and Duncan on the back benches in the House of Commons. There, they will no longer be shackled by the assumed rules of collective responsibility, expected of government ministers.
Further down the line, he has vowed to bring Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31, with or without a deal with Brussels.

One major topic discussed during the 12th round of talks was China purchasing more American agricultural products. The United States is expected to facilitate conditions favoring such procurement. Both sides decided to hold the next round of talks in the United States in September.
The latest development didn’t come easy as both sides witnessed ups and downs since trade talks began in February 2018. The negotiations suffered a big setback after Washington moved unilaterally to impose extra tariffs on 200 billion US dollars’ worth of Chinese goods in May, disregarding protestations from Beijing. The move, which went against the consensus reached by the two heads of state at the G20 Argentina Summit late last year, also had a negative impact on the world economy. In its latest world economic outlook report, the International Monetary Fund revised its forecasts for global growth to 3.2 percent in 2019 and 3.5 percent in 2020, both down 10 basis points from its April projections.
History has proved that there are no winners in trade wars and cooperation is the only correct choice for both China and the United States. The two state leaders agreed to get back on the right track and resume trade talks on the basis of equality and mutual respect at the G20 Osaka Summit in June. Such a consensus was reflected by discussion over China increasing its purchase of U.S. agricultural products in accordance with domestic demand and the United States creating preferential circumstances for this to take place. In addition, the two sides agreed to continue high-level consultations in the United States in a little over a month’s time. Both parties again demonstrated their willingness to meet each other half way and keep up the momentum for further dialogue until the disputes are settled. Beijing and Washington have every reason to push things forward.
The outcome of the latest round of talks shows that the two sides didn’t shy away from sensitive and thorny issues, but rather exchanged views on a number of subjects including their core concerns. This reflected the pragmatic manner both sides held in resolving problems and contradictions.
The latest talks were held in Shanghai, a city that witnessed the signing of the Shanghai Communique, or the China-US Joint Communique, 47 years ago, which opened the door to the normalization of bilateral relations. Shanghai is also the frontier for China’s opening up to the outside world with over 4,800 U.S. companies operating and profiting here. The city has now witnessed the Sino-U.S. trade talks getting back on track. To keep up the positive momentum, once again, the key lies in putting the Osaka consensus into practice, adherence to the principle of equality and mutual respect, as well as respecting each other's legitimate concerns. Intense pressure would only lead to more unpredictable scenarios which are most likely unconducive to solving the problem. In the meantime, Beijing has long voiced its position on major issues concerning its bottom line, upon which the Chinese side is unlikely to compromise in future talks.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang meets with Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea (ROK) Kang Kyung-wha and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, who are here to attend the ninth meeting of foreign ministers of China, Japan and the ROK, in Beijing, capital of China, Aug. 22, 2019. (Xinhua/Shen Hong)
BEIJING, Aug. 22 -- China attaches great importance to cooperation with the Republic of Korea (ROK) and Japan and is ready to make joint efforts to pursue a higher level of trilateral cooperation with its two neighbors, Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday.

Li called on the three countries to safeguard the rules-based multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, and work on reaching a comprehensive and high-level free trade agreement at an early date to promote the liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment.
The Chinese premier also called on the three countries to jointly promote technological innovation to share development opportunities and innovative achievements, work together to advance development and prosperity to push forward East Asian cooperation, and jointly maintain regional peace and stability to contribute to a political resolution to the Korean Peninsula issue, so as to achieve denuclearization and lasting peace on the peninsula.
Li also called for increased people-to-people exchanges to improve mutual understanding of the three peoples and cement foundation for trilateral cooperation.
Kang Kyung-wha commended the progress of the meeting and wished the meeting among leaders of the three countries, which is due to be held in China later this year, a success. The ROK is confident of the prospects for cooperation with China, she added.
Taro Kono said Japan is ready to closely work with China and the ROK to guarantee the success of the leaders' meeting and his country is willing to work with China to promote a lasting, healthy and stable development of bilateral relations.

The U.S. government has approved a possible 500-million-U.S. dollar military sale to Taiwan, claiming that the move will help to improve the security and defensive capability of the recipient.
Subsequently, Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen expressed ""gratitude,"" saying that the arms sale was ""timely.""
The situation across the Taiwan Strait, which is already complicated and grim, is worsening as the United States has been using Taiwan to contain China while the Taiwan administration kept seeking foreign intervention.
The Taiwan question concerns China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and is the most important and sensitive issue in China-U.S. relations.
The U.S. arms sales to Taiwan constitutes a serious violation of international law, the basic norms governing international relations, the one-China principle and the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and undermine China's sovereignty and security interests.
China's firm opposition to such arms sales is consistent and firm.
Since the current U.S. administration took office, it has constantly played the ""Taiwan card"" to contain China, especially in arms sales to Taiwan and military exchanges between the United States and Taiwan.
This has seriously damaged China-U.S. relations and jeopardized peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.
The Taiwan question, which concerns China's core interests and the national bond of the Chinese people, brooks no external interference.
The U.S. administration has once again stirred up sensitive nerves in the Taiwan Strait. Its gross interference in China's internal affairs has aroused the strong indignation of the Chinese people on both sides of the Strait.
Some Taiwan organizations and people protested outside the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) in Taipei, condemning U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and demanding ""no war, only peace,"" and ""Taiwan is not a pawn for the United States.""
Therefore, we would like to advise the U.S. side to clearly recognize the high sensitivity and serious harm of arms sales to Taiwan, correct mistakes, honor its commitments and handle Taiwan-related issues in a prudent and proper manner in accordance with the one-China principle and the provisions of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques.
Taiwan's current Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration, which is teetering on the brink of collapse, was overjoyed at the U.S. arms sales as if it had been given a ""straw to save its life.""
Tsai Ing-wen and the DPP administration have escalated provocations against the Chinese mainland, created disturbances recently and cooperated with the United States in vigorously clamoring the so-called ""military threat"" from the mainland.
In the face of next year's general election on the island, Tsai and the DPP will not hesitate to let Taiwan serve as a pawn for forces of external interference in order to protect their power, regardless of the safety and well-being of the Taiwanese people.
This party has not only misjudged the situation but also deviated from the people's heart.
U.S. weapons cannot guarantee Taiwan's security. Tsai and the DPP cannot secure their power and position by seeking foreign interference or threatening the people.
Tsai, the DPP and ""Taiwan independence"" separatist elements should not play with fire or even think about it. They are doomed to be alone in the face of the pressure of their own actions.
On April 17, 124 years ago, the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed, securing foreigner's occupation of Taiwan for half a century. It left lasting, painful memories for all Chinese.
Today's China will never allow the historical tragedy of national division to repeat itself.

He said China stands ready to work with Croatia to strengthen mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation and carry on friendship on the basis of mutual respect, equity and mutual trust, so as to explore new dimensions for bilateral relations and push forward bilateral cooperation to a new level. On practical cooperation, Li said China is ready to expand the scale of two-way trade, boost the level of two-way investment, and increase the import of Croatian specialty products that suit the demands of the Chinese market, and deepen people-to-people exchanges including culture and tourism. ""China will support its companies to participate in the construction of Croatian ports and railways in line with market principles,"" Li said. The Chinese premier is scheduled to inspect the Peljesac Bridge project with his Croatian counterpart on Thursday. The bridge, which used European Union (EU) standards and funds, is contracted by a Chinese company through bidding. ""The Peljesac Bridge project is a model of tripartite cooperation among China, Croatia and the EU, and realizes mutual benefits and win-win results,"" Li said. Li stressed that the 16+1 cooperation mechanism has played an important role in enhancing cooperation between China and 16 Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC) and cementing the European integration process. China appreciates Croatia's work on facilitating 16+1 cooperation and is ready to make joint efforts with Croatia toward a successful China-CEEC leaders' meeting, Li said. This is the first time ever by a Chinese premier to visit Croatia since the establishment of diplomatic ties. Plenkovic welcomed Li on the visit and said Croatia stands ready to strengthen the understanding of China's history and culture, share China's development opportunities, support the building of the Belt and Road so as to benefit the two countries and peoples. Noting the high-level development of bilateral relations, Plenkovic said Croatia and China will ink a series of cooperation documents during Premier Li's visit, which demonstrates the latest achievements of practical cooperation between the two sides. ""The Peljesac Bridge is highly rated by the Croatian people and China is Croatia's important partner on infrastructure construction,"" said the Croatian prime minister, adding that Croatia is willing to further enhance cooperation with China in politics, economy, culture, tourism and port infrastructure. Saying he is looking forward to co-chairing the eighth leaders' meeting of China-CEEC, Plenkovic also commended positively the outcomes of the 21st China-EU leaders' meeting and said as an EU member, Croatia stands ready to play an active and constructive role in cementing the development of EU-China ties. After the meeting, Li and Plenkovic witnessed the signing of multiple bilateral cooperation documents in areas including trade and investment, tourism, quality inspection and sports. The two sides also released a joint communique between the two governments. Prior to the meeting, Plenkovic held a grand welcome ceremony at the St. Mark's Square for Li."	CCTV

His dramatic statement came after MPs voted by 328 to 321 to put forward an emergency bill Wednesday to block Johnson from taking Britain out of the European Union (EU) on Oct. 31 without a deal.
Johnson said if MPs vote for the no deal bill, the only way forward would be for the people to decide.
He said: ""Let there be no doubt Parliament is on the brink of wrecking any deal with Brussels.""
An election could take place on Oct. 14, but no potential date has yet been agreed.
Addressing a packed House of Commons, Johnson said he does not want an election but if MPs vote for the no-deal bill on Wednesday the public will have to choose who goes to Brussels on Oct. 17.
""If Jeremy Corbyn (the Labour leader) goes to Brussels, he will do what the EU wants,"" he said, adding that if he goes, he will get a deal from the EU.
Rebel Conservative MPs had been warned ahead of the vote they would be kicked out of the party if they voted against the government. But it was confirmed by Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom that the rebels would be given a second chance to vote with the government during the Wednesday debate.
It they are suspended from the party, it would prevent them from standing as Conservatives in the general election.
During a day of high drama, as MPs returned to Westminster after their long summer break, Johnson suffered a blow when one of the Conservative MPs, Phillip Lee, defected to the minority Liberal Democrats.
His departure from the Conservative benches meant Johnson's government no longer has even its majority of one in the House of Commons.
If the emergency no-deal bill passes through both houses of parliament and receives Royal consent from Queen Elizabeth this week, it will halt Britain's planned departure from the EU on Oct. 31 unless there is a deal between Britain and Brussels.
Supports say the move is seen as potentially the last opportunity for MPs to prevent Britain leaving without a deal.
As MPs debated, hundreds of protesters chanting ""stop the coup"" marched past the Houses of Parliament. They blocked the road alongside the famous building, from Parliament Square to College Green in Westminster. Some held smoke-bombs as they shouted their messages.
It was a reaction to Johnson's decision to prorogue, or close down parliament next week for five weeks.
The debate Tuesday night was generated by Conservative rebel MP Oliver Letwin who said it would provide the government with the time to seek to solve the Brexit problem and enable parliament to help resolve an issue which has proved very difficult.
The bill to be debated Wednesday would pave the way for a Brexit extension to Jan. 31 if no deal with the EU is agreed by then.
In a noisy debate in the famous wood-panelled chamber, the Conservative Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg accused MPs wanting to block a no-deal Brexit of deliberately attempting to allow an extension long enough to allow a second piece of legislation, or to allow Brexit to be scrapped altogether.
Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, denied the emergency bill was not an attempt to reverse Brexit.
Corbyn said the bill, if passed this week, is about providing ""vital breathing space"" to allow MPs to find a way through ""this mess"".
The latest YouGov opinion poll continues to put Johnson's Conservatives ahead. Of people quizzed for the poll, 35 percent said they backed the Conservatives, a 2 percent rise over last week. The main opposition Labour Party has seen its share also go up by 3 percent to 25 percent. The minority Liberal Democrats, according to the poll, would see their share drop from 21 percent to 16 percent.

LONDON, Sept. 16 -- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ended a hectic day in Luxembourg Monday insisting Britain will leave the European Union on Oct. 31.
Johnson held talks with President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker. He gave an interview to British reporters to explain his side of how the day had progressed.
Johnson said there has been movement in talks in trying to find an alternative plan to the Irish backstop to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
He said: ""We are now at the stage where we need to start accelerating the work and that was the agreement today with Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier (the EU's chief Brexit negotiator).
""Yes there is a good chance of a deal, yes I can see the shape of it. Everybody can see roughly what could be done.""
Johnson said: ""I will uphold the constitution. I will obey the law but we will come out on October 31st. We're going to come out on October 31st and it's vital that people understand that the UK will not extend. We won't go on remaining in the EU beyond October. What on earth is the point?""
Ian Blackford, leader at Westminster of the Scottish National Party (SNP) was critical of Johnson's assessment, accusing him of being guilty of ""dealing in fiction, not in facts"".
He said the meeting between Johnson and Juncker confirmed the British government has failed to bring forward a single proposal to ""end the Brexit mess"". ""Boris Johnson must stop dealing in fiction and start addressing the facts,"" he added.
On the events in Luxembourg, the EU said the aim of what was the first meeting between Juncker and Johnson was to take stock of the ongoing technical talks between the EU and Britain and to discuss the next steps.
The statement added that Juncker recalled it is Britain's responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions that are compatible with the Brexit withdrawal agreement.
Juncker underlined the commission's continued willingness and openness to examine whether such proposals meet the objectives of the backstop.
""Such proposals have not yet been made,"" the statement said.
The statement added the European Council meeting on Oct. 17 will be an important milestone in the process, adding the 27 member states of the bloc remain united.
Juncker is to address the European parliament on Wednesday morning in Strasbourg, the statement concluded.
Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel went ahead with the media briefing, with the place prepared for Johnson left empty.
Bettel said the only solution that protected the EU's single market and prevented a hard Irish border was the Brexit withdrawal agreement that has already been rejected three times by politicians in Britain's House of Commons.
Johnson said he had cancelled attending the conference with Bettel because of concerns they would be ""drowned"" by protesters.
""I don't think it would have been fair to the Prime Minister of Luxembourg. I think there was clearly going to be a lot of noise,"" Johnson told British reporters.
In London, Downing Street described the meeting with Juncker as constructive, saying the pair agreed contact between Britain and the European Commission would be stepped up in the coming days.
Johnson's focus will switch Tuesday to the Supreme Court, Britain's highest legal chamber. A panel of judge will start to hear a case claiming that Johnson had been unlawful in the way he prorogued, or suspended, the British Parliament last week until Oct. 14.

(Xinhua/Joel Lerner)
CHICAGO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Two families filed lawsuits against Boeing in Chicago on Monday over the 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people, the same day when Boeing held its shareholders meeting at the James Simpson Theatre in the Field Museum of Natural History in downtown Chicago.
Manant Vaidya, the plaintiff, lost his father Pannagesh Bhaskar Vaidya, mother Hansini Pannagesh Vaidya, sister Kosha Pannagesh Vaidya, brother-in-law Preritkumar Dixit and two nieces, 14-year-old Ashka Dixit and and 13-year-old Anushka Dixit in the crash of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in March 2019.
""I lost three generations of my family, my parents, my sister, my nieces. If a person lost just one life, their whole life is shattered. But right now with me, I'm more like, I don't know. I'm completely lost right now,"" said Vaidya at a news conference held at the Clifford Law Offices room in downtown Chicago on Monday.
Paul Njoroge, another plaintiff, lost his wife Carolyne Nduta Karanja, mother-in-law Ann Karanja, 6-year-old son Ryan Njoroge Njuguna, 4-year-old daughter Kellie W. Pauls and 9-month-old infant daughter Rubi W. Pauls.
""I stay up all night crying, thinking of the horror that they must have endured as pilots struggled to keep the plane flying for six minutes,"" he said. ""The terror that my wife must have experienced with little Rubi on her lap ... Our two children beside her, crying for their daddy, my mom in law, feeling helplessness, those six minutes will forever be embedded in my mind. I was not there to help them. I couldn't save them.""
Njoroge choked several times while reading his statement, Vaidya stood up and walked over to pat him on the back at one point.
Kevin Durkin, a partner at Clifford Law Offices, promised that if Boeing denies its negligence in the crash, his firm would ""seek every single email, text message that was between them and the FAA"".
Alleged problems with the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) have been widely reported to be a likely contributor to the crashes.
In a written statement published earlier, Boeing President and CEO Dennis Muilenburg said, ""We at Boeing are sorry for the lives lost in the recent 737 MAX accidents ... All of us feel the immense gravity of these events across our company and recognize the devastation of the families and friends of the loved ones who perished.""
""We've had teams of our top engineers and technical experts working tirelessly in collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration and our customers to finalize and implement a software update that will ensure accidents like that of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 never happen again,"" the statement read.
Boeing said it remains confident in the aircraft and has promised software changes to the MCAS function. ""It will be among the safest airplanes ever to fly,"" read the statement from Muilenburg.
Muilenburg disputed the saying that the 737 MAX was rushed to market. ""It was a six-year development; 1,600 test-flights of the airplane; 3,700 flight hours of development on the Max, so it was thorough and it was disciplined,"" he told investors during a Q&A session at Boeing's annual shareholder meeting in Chicago on Monday.
Outside the Field Museum there were six protestors carrying the photographs of crash victims.
Laurie Engel carried photos of Bennet and Melvin Riffel, two brothers from California of the United States who lost their lives during the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash. She told Xinhua that she just wanted to raise the awareness of Boeing and ""not to put profit before people's safety"".
Tarek Milleron, uncle of 24-year-old Samya Stumo who was killed on the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, was among the protestors.
The crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 in October 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in March 2019 made headlines around the world, and finally led to the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft by European, Asian and American authorities. Boeing's stock lost 20 dollars per share of value since March 11, the day after the Ethiopian Airlines crash, equivalent to a 5 percent drop in the stock price.
The families' lawsuit was filed in the federal district court in Chicago.   Tarek Milleron (L), uncle of 24-year-old Samya Stumo who was killed on the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, protests outside the James Simpson Theatre in the Field Museum of Natural History, where Boeing holds its annual shareholders meeting, in Chicago, the United States, on April 29, 2019.

Laurie Engel carried photos of Bennet and Melvin Riffel, two brothers from California of the United States who lost their lives during the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash. She told Xinhua that she just wanted to raise the awareness of Boeing and ""not to put profit before people's safety"". Tarek Milleron, uncle of 24-year-old Samya Stumo who was killed on the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, was among the protestors. The crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 in October 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in March 2019 made headlines around the world, and finally led to the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft by European, Asian and American authorities. Boeing's stock lost 20 dollars per share of value since March 11, the day after the Ethiopian Airlines crash, equivalent to a 5 percent drop in the stock price. The families' lawsuit was filed in the federal district court in Chicago. "	CCTV

Several police officers were injured after they were attacked by rioters while they were on duty in Tsuen Wan. Hong Kong's Commissioner of Police Lo Wai-chung visited the injured officers in Princess Margaret Hospital on Sunday night.
Lo expressed strong anger and condemnation against the reckless, violent and unlawful acts and said the police force will strive to investigate all violent acts that have caused serious, even life-threatening injuries to the police officers.
Sunday's marches took place in Tsuen Wan and neighboring areas. After the marches ended, violent protesters deviated from their routes to attack police officers.
Some radical protesters hurled bricks and petrol bombs at police officers outside Yeung Uk Road Market in Tsuen Wan. They also aimed strong light beams at the officers and setting up barricades to confront the police.
Masked protesters, armed with poles and hats, escalated their violence in the afternoon and evening. They blocked various roads in Tsuen Wan, paralyzing traffic in the vicinity.
Having given repeated warnings to the protesters in vain, anti-riot officers fired tear gas and used minimum force to disperse them.
Some demonstrators also took down the national flag at the Kwai Chung Sports Ground, where the rally took place, and trampled on it, challenging the authority of the country and breaching the National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance, the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said in a statement.
The illegal and violent acts are appalling and they are pushing Hong Kong to a very dangerous edge. The government strongly condemns the violence, it said.
At the site, the police repeatedly unfurled signs for the demonstrators to leave, but demonstrators ignored the warning of the police. A police commander at the scene ordered to deploy at least two specialized crowd management vehicles, commonly known as the ""water cannon vehicles"", to disperse the crowd.
At around 7:30 p.m., many masked demonstrators who had been dispersed gathered again in Yi Pei Square of Tsuen Wan, holding iron bars, wooden sticks and bricks. They smashed doors and windows of several shops and broke some closed-circuit televisions.
About half an hour later, several anti-riot police officers arrived at the scene where shops were vandalized, and were immediately surrounded and assaulted brutally by a large group of masked radicals holding long metal rods.
With only small shields for defense, the police officers tumbled backward along the Sha Tsui Road, with the violent protesters chasing after them. In face of the extremely dangerous situation, a police officer fired a warning shot into the sky.
Superintendent Leung Kwok-wing of the New Territories South Regional Crime Headquarters said the police fired the shot as his life was in danger.

In a Nov. 15 speech at the Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy, the top U.S. diplomat once again blasted China over Hong Kong, saying that the Communist Party of China is ""inconsistent"" with what it has promised regarding the policy of ""one country, two systems.""
For the record, since Hong Kong's return to China 22 years ago, China's central government has been faithfully implementing the ""one country, two systems"" policy in strict accordance with the constitution and the Basic Law.
Since this June, Beijing has been consistent with its sturdy support to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government and local police force to end violence and restore order in the city.
Yet certain U.S. politicians like Pompeo have refused to acknowledge that fact.
As a matter of fact, the kind of ""one country, two systems"" they want the Chinese government to be consistent with is to deny Beijing's due constitutional rights and sovereign responsibilities over part of its own territory. In their mind, Hong Kong's autonomy and Beijing's legitimate jurisdiction are mutually exclusive.
That is deliberate distortion. The policy endows Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy, but that autonomy only happens within the framework of one country. Any attempt to erode that principle will not be allowed.
Also in his remarks, Pompeo talked about his government's intention to encourage the Hong Kong issue to be resolved in a ""nonviolent"" way.
If Washington is truly interested in ending violence in Hong Kong, it had better stop acting as the talisman of those Hong Kong separatists and rioters who have kept trashing the rule of law and disrupting social order with their violent acts.
Since June, violent protesters in Hong Kong have vandalized shops, attacked police officers, blocked roads, torched mass transit railway stations, turned universities into strongholds, forced classes to be suspended, and committed such horrendous crimes as stabbing and burning people who disagree with them.
Instead of encouraging those rioters to use nonviolent means, some U.S. politicians like Pompeo have chosen to add fuel to the fire. They met Joshua Wong Chi-fung and other like-minded separatists, have been pushing the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, and are going to greater and greater lengths in their rumor-mongering campaign on the Hong Kong issue.
Some sanctimonious U.S. lawmakers including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi even showed sympathy for the fanatic rioters and called their atrocities ""a beautiful sight to behold,"" while others defamed Hong Kong police and judicial bodies who have been strictly enforcing the law. Their practices of hypocrisy and double standard are too obvious to miss.
Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs and brook no interference from any foreign forces. And Beijing will continue to live up to its commitment to ""one country, two systems.""

HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam told a press conference that the government has invoked the power under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance and make a new regulation in the name of prohibition on face covering regulation, to ""create a deterrent effect against masked, violent protesters and rioters.""
The ban, designed to end violence and restore order, will come into effect on Friday midnight, Lam said.
The move added Hong Kong to the list of countries and regions that have anti-mask legislations, including France, Canada and many states in the United States. In Canada, those breaking the anti-mask law during a riot or unlawful assembly face up to 10 years in prison.
Unrest has raged for more than three months in Hong Kong as radical protesters, often black-clad and masked, set fires on streets, vandalized public facilities including metro stations, and assaulted police, civilians and businesses.
Advocates for the ban said masks have been used by rioters to conceal identities and escape legal penalties in the drawn-out unrest, leading to a higher level of aggression on their part.

Since then, there have been ongoing violent protests and hundreds of arrests in Barcelona. Spanish Home Affairs Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska warned of heavy sentences of up to six years in prison for those arrested, saying the government was ""going to apply the penal code with all of its strength against the violent separatism which attacks the law."" In contrast to the support shown for the Hong Kong riots, western governments and media have for the most part kept silent on the ongoing Catalan situation. Gavin Newlands, a member of the Scottish parliament, said on his Twitter account that ""as of 0707 there was still nothing on the events in Catalonia last night on BBC News. But there is a piece on Hong Kong politicians shouting in Parliament."" M D Nalapat, an Indian scholar from Manipal University, commented in an article published in the Pakistan Observer that ""there are moments when silence is shameful, and this is what is happening in the wake of the Madrid Court showing a contempt for the very European values that Brussels prides itself on."" The way media organizations from western countries address the issues in Hong Kong and Catalonia shows the double standards that are applied in interfering in other countries' internal affair to suit their own interests. There seems to be a western media blackout on the Catalonia situation due to concerns that the violent acts will spread out to other places. Whereas in Hong Kong, they are thinking and doing the complete opposite. They put up the pretense of ""wishing the best for Hong Kong,"" but are actually secretly hoping for the riots to escalate and hinder China's development. However, history has proven that their double standards will not help maintain their interests, and will backfire on them. With the latest protests in other part of the world, it is apparent that violent acts by radical Hong Kong protesters are being copied by people in western countries. Apart from the separatist acts in Spain, radical environmentalists from western countries have also staged ""Extinction Rebellion"" protests in over 20 cities around the world, with some of their strategies and methods reportedly coming from Hong Kong protesters. As much as the rule of law is respected and valued in western countries, no country that governs with law will allow situations similar to that of Hong Kong to happen. Those countries which help fan the violence in Hong Kong are hurting themselves and will be crushed by their own weight."	CCTV

The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, drawing condemnation from Beijing. The act, if it passes the Senate and then becomes law, will not only harm relations between China and the United States and severely damage Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, but also cause boomerang effects to the United States itself.
The act requires Washington to review Hong Kong's autonomy annually to justify the special trading status the city receives under United States law. This is de facto interference in China's domestic affairs, and is contrary to the basic principles and promises Washington made when it established diplomatic relations with Beijing.
What Hong Kong needs most right now is an end to the riots and violence, the restoration of public order, and maintenance of the rule of law. Intervention by the United States in the affairs of Hong Kong will only inflame the rioter's aggression and aggravate the already challenging public security situation. This would further damage Hong Kong's development at a time when some institutions are already predicting that Hong Kong's economy will flatline or contract this year.
As one of the major trading partners of the United States in Asia, disorder in Hong Kong offers no benefits to America's economy. Over the past decade, the United States enjoyed a surplus of some 297 billion U.S. dollars from its trade with Hong Kong – the surplus was nearly 34 billion U.S. dollars last year alone. Scrapping Hong Kong's special trading status will only make Washington's trade deficit worse. Hong Kong is also a major destination for investment by the United States: In 2017, its direct investments in the city surpassed 81 billion U.S. dollars. And a loss of stability in Hong Kong will undermine the interests of the 85,000 American nationals living in the city and the 1,300-plus American companies operating there.
Washington needs to put an end to the efforts to bring the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act into law. The support it would provide to rioters in the city harms the interests of the people of Hong Kong as well as the interests of the United States.

It's clear to anyone looking at the situation through fair eyes that the city enjoys a high degree of autonomy.
The string of violent incidents that have rocked Hong Kong over the past four months has put a serious strain on the city's social cohesion and economic health.

Tang Ping-keung, deputy commissioner of police, said at a press briefing on Monday that during the series of protests, radical protesters acted lawlessly and escalated the level of violence. They have spread the violent acts across Hong Kong, causing serious inconvenience towards the general public's daily life and posing threats to people's safety.
The 149 people, arrested between Aug. 9 and Aug. 12, comprise 111 male and 38 female, aged between 15 to 53. They were suspected of crimes including unlawful assembly, assault on policemen, obstruction of police in the execution of duty, possession of offensive weapons and dangerous objects.
Tang said that on Aug. 11, some people turned a deaf ear to the police's objection and got involved in unauthorized rallies. Some of the protesters later went to different places all over Hong Kong and blocked main roads and thoroughfares, besieged police stations and damaged police vehicles.
In Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon Peninsula, a mob threw petrol bombs into the police station, and the legs of a policeman were burnt by fire consequently.
The police noticed that some protesters were involved in extremely violent activities, and therefore they carried out intelligence-led operations and arrested 15 core members of the mobs on Aug. 11 in Causeway Bay, the Hong Kong Island.
Tang called on protesters to stop using violence to disturb Hong Kong's social order and he hoped that the Hong Kong society can soon restore calm.

The 149 people, arrested between Aug. 9 and Aug. 12, comprise 111 male and 38 female, aged between 15 to 53. They were suspected of crimes including unlawful assembly, assault on policemen, obstruction of police in the execution of duty, possession of offensive weapons and dangerous objects. Tang said that on Aug. 11, some people turned a deaf ear to the police's objection and got involved in unauthorized rallies. Some of the protesters later went to different places all over Hong Kong and blocked main roads and thoroughfares, besieged police stations and damaged police vehicles. In Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon Peninsula, a mob threw petrol bombs into the police station, and the legs of a policeman were burnt by fire consequently. The police noticed that some protesters were involved in extremely violent activities, and therefore they carried out intelligence-led operations and arrested 15 core members of the mobs on Aug. 11 in Causeway Bay, the Hong Kong Island. Tang called on protesters to stop using violence to disturb Hong Kong's social order and he hoped that the Hong Kong society can soon restore calm."	CCTV

The statement was made in response to an open letter from a group of overseas politicians and persons to the HKSAR chief executive. The HKSAR government firmly refutes unfounded and misguided claims in the letter.
In the statement, a spokesperson of the HKSAR government said that over the past six months violence had escalated and reached an alarming level.
Masked rioters vandalized public facilities and shops, committed arson, hurled petrol bombs as well as wantonly attacked police officers and people with different views, the spokesperson said.
An innocent man was set on fire in broad daylight by protesters while a government contract cleaner was killed by a brick thrown at him. So far, 520 police officers have been injured on duty. Meanwhile, no protesters were killed as a result of direct police action.
The extent of students and minors being involved in such violent protests is particularly worrying, the spokesperson added.
On New Year's Eve, rioters hurled petrol bombs in various districts, causing damage to a police vehicle and three private cars, according to Hong Kong police.
Despite the rampant violence, police exercised restraint in law enforcement, the spokesperson said, noting that police did not initiate actions against protesters and only responded with appropriate and proportionate force when protesters took part in illegal activities.
The actions and response of police over the Christmas period, and at all times over the past six months, were only in response to the blatant disregard for public safety and order by radical protesters, the spokesperson said, adding that police acted with restraint and the minimum force necessary to restore law and order.
The spokesperson further stated that the HKSAR government is determined to safeguard the core values of Hong Kong at all times as they are ""the cornerstone of our long-term prosperity and stability.""
Noting that the extensive media coverage -- local, international and in the digital world -- about the protests and events, the spokesperson said it is ""unprecedented in Hong Kong's history.""
""That in itself is evidence enough that the freedom of the press is well protected, and citizens of Hong Kong continue to enjoy the freedom of participating in lawful and peaceful demonstrations to express their views,"" the spokesperson said.
