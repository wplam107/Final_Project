The event in Edinburgh Place in Central, which organisers said was attended by 380 social work students and social workers at its peak, came two weeks after social worker Jackie Chen Hung-sau, who claimed she had been trying to defuse tensions at a protest, was arrested and charged with rioting, an offence punishable by 10 years in prison. “Police officers have been using unreasonable charges to arrest frontline social workers, such as Chen, in the protests,” said Kelvin Chan, a 25-year-old social work student from Hong Kong College of Technology. “They do not understand the roles of not only social workers, but also that of journalists and lawmakers.” On Sunday night, Democratic Party lawmaker Ted Hui Chi-fung, who was seen telling officers not to use excessive force on protesters in North Point, was taken to a police station.

On Monday, lawyers for Education University’s student union president Kex Leung Yiu-ting asked the High Court to order the MTR Corporation to keep unedited footage taken from two stations linked to the police operation on August 31. But the railway operator questioned if the court had the jurisdiction to grant the injunctive relief, and said the footage would be kept for three years, as it had previously assured the public it would. Mr Justice Anderson Chow Ka-ming acknowledged that the court could only order the preservation when there is evidence MTR Corp may destroy the footage. The judge will hand down his decision on a later date.    Leung’s request was revealed a week after he took the rail operator to the same court demanding the compulsory disclosure of that footage to his lawyers, as he is considering a separate legal action against police.

A front-page advertisement, placed by Hong Kong’s largest pro-Beijing party in a local newspaper on Wednesday and calling on the government to seize private developers’ land for public housing, set many talking. Some say the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) made that move to woo voters ahead of upcoming district council elections, knowing that its popularity has slipped since it took the government’s side in the extradition bill saga that triggered the ongoing protests. Others say the politicians are helping to divert attention from the civil unrest that has gone on for more than three months and become increasingly violent. What raised eyebrows, however, was the way mainland China’s state mouthpieces chorused on Friday that unaffordable and inadequate housing was a cause of the protests. They endorsed the DAB suggestion to use the Lands Resumption Ordinance to seize private owners’ land, and urged the city’s big developers to “show their sincerity” and help the government out of the ongoing crisis.    Hong Kong developers are estimated to own a huge land bank of 1,000 hectares of abandoned farmland. If the government seizes 150 hectares of usable land, it would be able to build 170,000 public homes within 10 years.	SCMP

Yet questions about the effectiveness of the legislation, which failed to clear congressional hurdles in earlier versions, have increased in tandem with the mounting endorsements. Lawmakers from Texas, Arizona, Vermont and New Jersey co-sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, bringing the number of supporters to 25 Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives. Seven senators, including Texas Republican John Cornyn, have joined 10 who had already signed on to an identical bill in their chamber. Sponsors and other advocates say the unrest that has rocked Hong Kong for more than three months – intermittently paralysing transport links, shutting street-level commerce and slashing local tourism revenue – will prompt a “yes” vote before the end of the current congressional session.

What if protesters set fires in the street? We cannot let rioters have the opportunity to wreak havoc – and we also have to protect residents and travellers,” he said. Since Hong Kong was returned from British rule in 1997, the annual display has brought about 300,000 residents and tourists to both sides of Victoria Harbour for the visual experience. It was cancelled in 2013 because of the Lamma Island boat tragedy and in 2014 because of the Occupy protests.	SCMP

The Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) has received 42 complaints involving officers abusing reporters and cameramen over the past three months, but it believes it is just the tip of the iceberg. Together with the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association (HKPPA), the HKJA gave more details of police violence, in cases when a number of reporters were pepper-sprayed in Mong Kok last Saturday, and reporters being called “black reporters” by officers, and having bright torches trained on them to make filming difficult. “There are growing hostile elements among the police force, or at least a sizeable segment of it, towards journalists, as shown in their deeds and words,” HKJA chairman Chris Yeung Kin-hing said. “Press freedom is under threat.” Both associations rejected police’s claims that there were “fake reporters” and that reporters had blocked police operation. Yeung said they had found only one single case of an allegedly fake press card over the past months. They had reported the case to the police, which rejected a formal investigation and only followed the case up after the HKJA issued a public statement in mid-August.

The additional congressional support for the bill, which would require the US government to assess Hong Kong’s level of political autonomy annually to determine whether it should continue to have a special trade status, comes as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee works to bring the legislation to a vote.

Keith Fong Chung-yin, president of the student union of Baptist University (HKBU), where 150 people joined an hour-long class boycott rally at noon, warned of staging another mass protest with other university students if the governments fails to meet all five demands of protesters by Friday. An estimated 30,000 university students staged a mass rally at Chinese University on September 2 to launch the protests in campuses across the city, with thousands forming human chains and a smaller number boycotting classes in the past week. Despite Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s announcement last week that she would formally withdraw the bill, protesters say that the government acceding to one of their five demands was too little, too late.    Demonstrators also want an inquiry into the police’s response to the protests; amnesty for arrested protesters; authorities to stop characterising the protests as riots; and universal suffrage.	SCMP
