Mainland China on Monday tried to brush aside the landslide defeat for the pro-establishment camp in Hong Kong’s district council elections, but scholars and analysts have called on Beijing to review the election setbacks and adjust its strategy for the city. China’s official media carried only brief reports of the vote – which saw the pro-democracy camp taking control of 17 out of 18 councils – without mentioning the results, but mainland analysts said the failure by pro-establishment candidates in the election should serve as a wake-up call to Beijing’s leaders. Song Sio-chong, professor of Shenzhen University’s Centre for Basic Laws of Hong Kong and Macau, said Beijing was puzzled by the strong support for pro-democracy candidates. “It appears that voters in Hong Kong cared less about the economy and livelihood issues and wanted to vent their anger at the government,” Song said. “If this is true, then the future governance of Hong Kong could become difficult and there is not much that Beijing can do.” Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections Hong Kong votes overwhelmingly for pro-democracy camp with record turnout in local elections But Song was not convinced the result would have a major impact on next year’s Legislative Council elections or the selection of future chief executives.

After nearly six months of unrelenting conflict, the elections – which are for the lowest tier of the administration – are seen as a barometer of support for the anti-government protest movement and de facto referendum on Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and her team. While district councils have been heavily dominated by her allies in the pro-Beijing camp, expectations are high that voters could side with more pan-democrats this time and send Lam a clear signal of how they view her government. As Hong Kong enjoyed a rare respite from chaotic protests for the fourth day in a row on Saturday, young voters were mobilising online, urging their peers to vote in the morning, rather than wait until later in the day as in previous elections.

Mainland officials have argued “only” the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) has the power to decide on issues of constitutionality.

A former Conservative Party chairman has joined the call for Johnson, who now leads the party, to correct the “historic error” of not giving BN(O) holders full citizenship, while the Liberal Democrats became the first major party to support in their election manifesto a “right of abode” for these Hongkongers. BN(O) passports are travel documents that the British government granted only to Hongkongers born before the 1997 handover. As they do not entail the right to live and work in Britain, there have been calls to upgrade BN(O)s to full citizenship status amid the protests and increasingly violent clashes with police in Hong Kong since June.

Senator Marco Rubio’s confidence over his bill’s prospects aligns with growing predictions from pundits, who say the president is in no position to push back, even if his signing of the bill that has angered Beijing complicates his efforts to bring a 17-month old trade war to an end. “My understanding is that they will sign” the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, Rubio said in a CNBC interview, after being asked about recent hawkish comments about China by Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. While Trump has not commented on the legislation recently, he discussed his trade war with China with reporters on Wednesday, saying: “I don’t think they’re stepping up to the level that I want.” Squawk Box

While US President Donald Trump is not expected to veto the bill, which enjoys broad bipartisan support, even the symbolic aspects may carry an extra significance – with a high-profile signing ceremony likely to further anger the Chinese government. “The Hong Kong issue has the potential to influence the process of the trade talks. China will have to respond … if Trump signs it into law,” said one person who is familiar with the trade talks.

Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu later softened his stance and said those under the age of 18 who left the campus would not be arrested for the time being, but that police would reserve the right to take follow-up action. Nearly 900 people had surrendered to police as of Wednesday morning, around 300 of them under 18, Lee said. Police in the evening said the figure had grown further to 1,000 with another 700 arrested.

Secretary for the Environment Wong Kam-sing made his comments on Wednesday, after wide discussions over whether firing of tear gas led to the emission of dioxins in the city’s air. The discussions were sparked after a frontline reporter, who frequently covered protests that were tear-gassed by police, said last week that he was diagnosed with chloracne – a skin condition linked to exposure to dioxins. But Senior Superintendent Wong Wai-shun, who claimed the amount of tear gas he had breathed in was far more than anyone, said he had not developed any chloracne at all.	SCMP

Central government officials criticised the court for failing to support the government in its efforts to end more than five months of increasingly violent social unrest. For the first time, they suggested that the city’s courts do not have the power to declare a local law invalid by checking it against the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution. China’s top legislative affairs body argued that only the national legislature had the right to decide on issues of constitutionality. Beijing’s reaction left its critics in Hong Kong fearing for the erosion of the city’s independent judiciary. They also feared that Beijing would decide to hand down its own interpretation of the Basic Law and overturn the court ruling. But members of the pro-establishment camp dismissed those concerns, saying Beijing was only reiterating its position. What are the key issues in the controversy over the court ruling? Why is the court’s decision controversial? Why is the court’s decision controversial? On October 4, after nearly four months of anti-government protests that were becoming increasingly violent, the Hong Kong government introduced a law banning the use of masks in public. It invoked the colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance, a bill which gave the chief executive far-reaching power to enact certain laws in the face of “public danger” and “emergency”. Protesters ignored the ban, but 25 pro-democracy lawmakers turned to the courts, upset that the government had implemented the law without consulting the legislature. On Monday, the High Court ruled that the law, when invoked on the grounds of public danger, was unconstitutional, and that the anti-mask law was excessive.

An officer was pierced in the calf by an arrow outside Polytechnic University on Sunday. Another policeman was hit by a metal ball. The mob rained petrol bombs on police, and even set an armoured riot-control truck ablaze. When a vehicle tried ramming into a group of officers, police responded by firing a live round.

It would be the first annual decline since 2009, when the world economy was reeling from the global financial crisis, and a government economist said things were unlikely to improve in the remainder of the year.

The initial estimate, before August, was 2 to 3 per cent. The year-on-year figure for the third quarter showed a drop of 2.9 per cent, the biggest such contraction in a decade.
