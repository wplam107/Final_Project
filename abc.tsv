Jane Poon, co-president of the Victoria Hongkongers Association, said police were detaining activists because they believed chances of backlash were low as people were mostly avoiding gathering in large groups. Beijing critic Jimmy Lai, the founder of Next Media, was arrested in Hong Kong last Friday. Labour Party vice-chairman Lee Cheuk-yan was also detained by police that day. Both men were held over their suspected involvement in an anti-extradition march in August last year but have been released.   Ms Poon, a former employee of Mr Lai's Next Media Group in Hong Kong, said Hong Kong authorities were using the stress of coronavirus to put more pressure on the pro-democracy groups. ""Less people are coming out because they are afraid of the coronavirus spreading in the community,"" she said. ""[The protesters] are under the stress of coronavirus and the Government still wants to put stress and pressure onto the community, onto the pro-democracy camp."" The Hong Kong Government dismissed the accusations. ""We reject the notion that prosecutions are undertaken for any purpose other than to uphold the rule of law in Hong Kong,"" a spokesman said. ""All the arrests were made based on evidence from investigations and strictly according to the laws in force."" An editorial in China's state-owned media outlet Global Times on the arrest of Mr Lai labelled him a ""modern-day new traitor"". ""No matter how later justice arrives, Lai will never escape punishment,"" it said.   The protests in Hong Kong started in June 2019 in response to a proposal to make controversial changes to Hong Kong's extradition laws.  The demonstrations continued and escalated into a political crisis.   Tom Grundy, editor-in-chief of Hong Kong Free Press, said he thought the Hong Kong Government would have used the lull in protester gatherings to concede to some of the pro-democracy group's demands, or de-escalate the situation. ""We've seen the opposite happen. And the arrest of those pro-democracy figures last week, it's probably a sign of more to come in terms of the crackdown here,"" he said. Mr Grundy said the built up public mistrust in the authorities has ""crashed headfirst into this virus outbreak"".   ""[Last weekend] there was one of the worst scenes of unrest we have seen for weeks in fact, because people just don't trust the Government,"" he said. ""This is a city that has been scarred by the SARS outbreak in 2003. ""It was felt the authorities and Carrie Lam did too little too late because they were fearful of offending China."" Ms Poon and Mr Grundy's comments come as Amnesty International called for an independent investigation into police violence during the Hong Kong protests.   The advocacy group released a new briefing paper on Thursday called Missing Truth, Missing Justice, arguing an independent commission of inquiry was needed to investigate human rights violations during the 2019 protests. ""Each passing day that the Hong Kong Government stubbornly resists establishing an independent inquiry adds to the accountability vacuum and erodes public trust further,"" said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International's regional director in Hong Kong. ""The mass protests that rocked Hong Kong in the latter half of 2019 are not over. ""The authorities may be counting on the coronavirus epidemic to extinguish the unrest, but unless they take action the demonstrations — and abuses linked to them — are eventually likely to return."" Hong Kong's Justice Department rejected Amnesty's call for an inquiry. ""Investigations into police actions and responses to protests will be processed under a statutory two-tier complaints system,"" a spokesman said. ""The two-tier complaints mechanism has been operating effectively under the Independent Police Complaints Council Ordinance which has a clear legal basis, thereby ensuring that complaints against police will be handled in a fair and just manner.""   Mr Grundy agreed that the protests were not over. ""I think judging by what happened in the aftermath of the Umbrella movement, the anger is still going to remain, and I think it's fair to say the protests are only somewhat in hibernation,"" he said. ""The anger is still there, it's still brewing."" There are 105 confirmed coronavirus cases in Hong Kong, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. There have been two deaths."	ABC (Australia)

For almost 11 months, pro-democracy protesters filled Hong Kong's streets, campaigning for a more democratic system of government. Train stations and traffic lights were frequently smashed and infrastructure set alight. Tear gas and water cannon were routinely deployed as the city's police force tried night after night to quell the unrest.   But according to Hong Kong teacher Lau Kam Fai, it has been the outbreak of coronavirus that has finally seen people withdraw from the streets. ""[There are] only a few lunch [protest] gatherings in the week for an hour or so,"" he said in a WhatsApp message. ""Nearly all people are avoiding crowded places or close gatherings or meetings. ""There are some infected cases in which people are affected in the same banquet or church, so people avoid gathering publicly.""   In an article for The Diplomat, Hong Kong-based political scientist Brian Fong said ""calm"" had been restored to Hong Kong's streets ""in an extraordinary way"". ""Since January, street protests have been almost completely halted to avoid the concentration of large crowds under the coronavirus crisis,"" he said. Hong Kong lawyer and political commentator Kevin Yam agreed. ""I think the protest movement was starting to go a little bit quiet anyway before the whole coronavirus situation,"" he said.   ""Then the whole outbreak happened and I think the whole idea of people trying not to congregate in large numbers in close proximity just made having mass protests that much more difficult. ""It's an uneasy calm, there's not much action but there's actually a lot of anger bubbling underneath.""   Mr Yam said Hong Kong's usually busy streets were dead. ""They're more dead now than at any time during the height of the violent protests and businesses, retailers, restaurants that I talk to are saying that, whereas during the protests, businesses were pretty much only down during the weekends,"" he said. ""Now every day is a bad business day for retailers and restaurateurs."" Vision obtained by the ABC of Hong Kong airport yesterday showed a completely empty terminal. South China Morning Post chief news editor Yonden Lhatoo said the anti-government movement had not been quelled, and expected protesters to return to the streets once the threat of coronavirus eased.   ""Oh yes absolutely, they'll be back with a vengeance, you can bet on that,"" he said. ""The minute this health crisis is over, bang, you'll see them all back on the streets, because nothing has been solved, nothing has been fixed, it's just the coronavirus coming along and interrupting everything."" Mr Lhatoo said the Hong Kong government's handling of the outbreak had increased public anger towards it.   ""We've had incidents where local residents have been up in arms about buildings in their neighbourhoods being designated as quarantine centres,"" he said. ""So they've come out to protest against that and when they've come out to protest against that it comes back to the same old problems regarding the anti-government movement. ""And then things get rowdy, police open fire with tear gas sometimes, pepper spray people, so that's still happening. ""Not on the industrial scale that you've seen over the past few months last year but it's still happening very much."" Joshua Wong, a 23-year-old activist and one of the most prominent faces of Hong Kong's protests, was adamant the fight for democracy in Hong Kong was not over. When approached for an interview about the coronavirus-related pause to the street protests, he rejected the suggestion they had come to an end. ""The protest didn't stop and we still continue the strike,"" he said in an email to the ABC.

2	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-27/badiucao-new-melbourne-exhibition-street-art-festival/11995456	February 27, 2020	Australian artist Badiucao's exhibition finally shown in Melbourne after China 'threat' ordeal	"This month, the art of Chinese dissident Badiucao has finally seen the light of day in Melbourne — more than a year after the Australian artist's Hong Kong exhibition was cancelled due to threats reportedly made by Chinese authorities. Reflecting on those past events, the Shanghai-born, Melbourne-based artist told ABC Melbourne: ""I would call it probably the darkest day in my life.""  Originally titled Gongle, the exhibition was supposed to be the kick-off event for Freedom of Expression Week in 2018, organised by the Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP), Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders.   ""It was meant to be a barometer for free expression in Hong Kong,"" Tom Grundy, editor-in-chief of HKFP told ABC Arts. Now retitled Made in Hong Kong, Banned in China, the exhibition features 19 works and sits at the entrance of The Facility in Kensington, where 150 street artists have taken over the three-storey, red brick warehouse and a 22-wagon freight train as part of Melbourne's inaugural 10-day urban art festival Can't Do Tomorrow. The exhibition has premiered at a tense moment in Chinese-Australian relations: this week the Chinese deputy ambassador defended China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak and accused Four Corners of fake news in a heated Q+A.   Badiucao is prolific, responding to global political affairs with his pen without missing a beat.  His portraits memorialise dissident figures and defenders of human rights, and his withering satirical cartoons lampoon Chinese leaders for censorship, rights violations and abuse of power, rendering an Orwellian portrait of life under the Communist Party regime. The Melbourne exhibition features a neon sculpture in tribute to Chinese dissident, human rights activist and Nobel Prize winner Liu Xiaobo and his wife Liu Xa, and a series of distinctly Badiucao cartoons, including a handcuffed Joshua Wong (a prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activist), and China's leader Xi Jinping holding a rifle and standing over a slain Winnie the Pooh (the much-loved honey-seeking bear was banned in China following a viral meme).   Badiucao's signature bold woodcut aesthetic references Communist propaganda art, but in fact owes a debt to German expressionist artist Käthe Kollwitz, known for her portrayal of the downtrodden, including peasants and working class people affected by poverty and hunger during wartime.  Badiucao says that in the 30s, writer Lu Xun (considered the father of modern Chinese literature) introduced Kollwitz's work to a group of Chinese left-wing artists who believed ""art should serve society"" and be a ""form of expression for the voiceless"" — sentiments the artist feels were lost when the Chinese Communist Party came into power in 1949. ""It [art] changed from an expression for the voiceless and became a voice of oppression, and became propaganda,"" Badiucao tells ABC Arts. Through his art, Badiucao hopes to bring Kollwitz's influence back to ""its original status as a voice for the voiceless"".   As the National Gallery of Victoria and four other Melbourne landmarks were illuminated in red and gold last Friday as ""a symbol of solidarity with Chinese Victorians"" during the coronavirus crisis, Badiucao offered his own tribute with two new works. On the opening night of his exhibition, the artist committed himself to a modified interrogation chair, also known as a tiger chair — a common instrument of interrogation in Chinese public security bureaus, according to a report by the Human Rights Watch. For three hours he read from his Wuhan Diary project, narrating a local's day-to-day existence under quarantine. In the exhibition space, a 12-metre paste-up mural featured faces rendered in black and white watercolour, four of them adorned with surgical masks inscribed with a message in Chinese characters which translates to: ""No I can't. No I don't understand."" The message references a document by Dr Li Wenliang — an early coronavirus whistleblower who was reprimanded by police and told to sign a letter that accused him of ""making false comments"" and spreading rumours. According to the BBC, the letter was shared on microblogging site Weibo at the start of January this year, a month before Dr Li succumbed to the disease and died. ""It's a huge tragedy,"" Badiucao told ABC Arts.   But everyday netizens have fought back with an online campaign: ""People are taking selfie[s] and on those face masks they are writing: 'No, I can't' and 'No, I don't understand',"" the artist said. ""They are saying no to [the] Chinese Government and saying yes to freedom of speech."" With the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak declared a global emergency by the World Health Organisation, the artist says the Chinese Government's control of information is ""pushing Chinese [people] to their limitation"". ""That's why we see people writing messages, posting selfies. Dr Li has become a hero, he is waking up [Chinese] people to see the truth about China.""   After his Gongle exhibition was called off, Badiucao went into hiding and withdrew from the internet. Badiucao had previously maintained anonymity, but then Chinese authorities ""actually found my family in China and threatened me through them,"" he told ABC in 2019. This presented him with a serious dilemma: remain silent, hide and hope for safety, or stand up and speak out. Six months after Gongle was cancelled, Badiucao appeared in ABC documentary China's Artful Dissident (which aired on the 2019 anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre) — in which he removed his mask and revealed his face for the first time. It was the same documentary that inspired Can't Do Tomorrow festival organisers to reach out to the artist on Twitter. ""Street and urban art are one of the oldest forms of public protest, and sometimes the most powerful work responds to the political and social world that we live in,"" festival director Zoe Paulsen told ABC Arts.   Not all the fall-out from the documentary has been positive, however: earlier this year, Badiucao withdrew from the Sydney exhibition, The Art of Defiance — Hong Kong: Revolution of Our Time, a group show about the Hong Kong protests, after the gallery owner watched the documentary and ""got scared and wanted to kill the whole show"". At first, the exhibition's organisers announced the show would continue with the omission of Badiucao's work, but after further negotiations, they reversed the decision.  Ultimately, the political cartoonist chose to boycott the exhibition in protest over the original decision to censor his work.   Buoyed by the exhibition finally opening in Melbourne, HKFP's Grundy says they will launch a public appeal to find space and finally display the political cartoonist's ""much needed"" work in Hong Kong ""before it's too late"". ""Humour and satire are the one thing that can undercut authoritarian regimes [like China],"" he told ABC Arts. Following Badiucao's decision to no longer be anonymous, he made the difficult decision to cut all ties to his family, in order to continue his fight for human rights, freedom and democracy.   When ABC Melbourne's Virginia Trioli asked him if creating art was worth that cost, he said: ""If no-one is standing up against it, the more people will have to suffer from it. ""I do hope my individual practice will awaken more people to join me. And only in that case, will we be free eventually."" Being an artist, he told ABC Arts, was ""something that's in my blood"". Made in Hong Kong, Banned in China runs until February 29 as part of Can't Do Tomorrow Urban Art Festival at The Facility in Melbourne.

China launches propaganda blitz to discredit Uyghur #StillNoInfo campaign	"Aydidar Kahar tucks her long hair behind her ear and smiles at the camera.   She takes the viewer on a tour of a mall in Xinjiang — decked out with luxury brands like Versace, Gucci and Dior — before the video abruptly cuts to her sitting at a desk, staring straight into the camera lens. ""Isn't the department store and the subway you just saw an epitome of the dramatic changes in Xinjiang?"" she said, in a video broadcast by Chinese state-owned Global Times. ""Grandma, you have been defaming Xinjiang … people in Xinjiang are living a decent life.""   Her sister Kedirya Keyser chimes in with a monologue of her own:  ""I learned about your misdeeds. You constantly accuse the Chinese Government of engaging in Uyghur cultural genocide. It's totally untrue."" The young women are the granddaughters of Rebiya Kadeer, an exiled Uyghur political activist based in the United States. Ms Kadeer, who was arrested in China in 1999 and later fled to the US, has highlighted the plight of the Uyghur people in China's far-north-western autonomous region of Xinjiang. More than 1 million people from the ethnic Muslim Turkic-speaking group have been rounded up in internment camps, the UN found, prompting allegations that China is committing ""cultural genocide"".   In December, Xinjiang Governor Shohrat Zakir told reporters that people held in detention camps have ""graduated"" and are now free ""to come and go"", but he did not provide evidence. That announcement sparked the hashtag #StillNoInfo, with Uyghurs the world over demanding news about their missing relatives.   The testimony from Ms Kadeer's granddaughters is the latest instalment of what Uyghur activists have called a ""propaganda blitz"" launched by China's state media.  Global Times and CGTN, the international arm of China Central Television (CCTV) news, have broadcast a slew of videos purporting to show the family members of Uyghurs abroad are safe and sound. The ramped-up coverage of Xinjiang is an overt attempt to counter narratives of widespread Uyghur oppression aired by Western media outlets like the New York Times, BBC and CNN.  Paired with the testimonials, in the past month CGTN has also aired ""documentaries"" about fighting terrorism in Xinjiang — which has long been China's justification for what it calls ""vocational centres"" and ""boarding schools"", not ""camps"". But some observers say the propaganda is backfiring and it reveals just how concerned the Chinese Communist Party is about international condemnation of Xinjiang. With Chinese media so closely entwined with the state — it is often seen as the ""throat and tongue"" of the Party — academics said their reports lack credibility.  The Uyghur Human Rights Project executive director Omer Kanat slammed ""China's propaganda videos"" as ""ineffective"".   ""No objective observer can believe that Ms Kadeer's relatives are speaking freely,"" he said. ""They are hostages, in effect, and the video is yet another source of emotional pain for their family members abroad."" Ms Kadeer is not alone — in recent months relatives of Uyghurs including Ferkat Jawdat, Arfat Erkin and World Uyghur Congress President Dolkun Isa, and more recently Aziz Isa Elkun, have appeared in videos circulated by state media. Journalist and academic Louisa Lim pointed out family members of outspoken Uyghurs are often used as ""bargaining chips"". ""This type of coverage undoubtedly depends on coercion, or intimidation, of family members in Xinjiang,"" she told the ABC.  ""There have recently been a lot of reports, for example by the New York Times and others, about how people are selectively and temporarily released from camps in order to say they are safe and sound."" Magnus Fiskesjo, associate professor of anthropology at Cornell University, described the recent videos as ""a sign of desperation"", especially after damning leaks revealed the scale of China's crackdown on the Muslim minority.    ""The regime is noticing that people hear about the abuses in Xinjiang and it is having an effect, so they try to counter that by spreading this sort of propaganda,"" he said.  ""There's definitely an information war that's going on — disinformation warfare attempts on the part of the Chinese Government."" Dr Fiskesjo has studied Chinese televised forced confessions and said videos of relatives discrediting their family members' accounts often took on an awkward, scripted quality.  ""There's just no way that they can say no, because they know that if they did, they would personally end up in camps or in prison,"" he said.  In the past month, CGTN has also released two slick productions, Fighting Extremism in Xinjiang and The Black Hand, which highlighted past terrorist attacks in Xinjiang. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying admonished reporters for not watching the programs last month.   ""I want to do a survey on the spot. How many of you, my foreign friends from the press, have watched these two documentaries? Please raise your hand. Anyone? No. None of you, actually. I'm disappointed,"" she said. ""When those ill-intentioned spread lies about Xinjiang, you flock to hear them. But when the facts and truth are readily available at hand, you sidestep it. Why is that?"" One video highlights the 2009 Urumqi riots, where nearly 200 people — most of them Han Chinese — were killed, and the 2014 stabbing rampage in Kunming, in a bid to justify ""counter-terrorism"" measures.   But Numuhammad Majid, president of the East Turkistan Association Australia in Adelaide, said a handful of violent incidents didn't justify the mass incarceration of more than a million people based on their ethnicity and religious beliefs. CGTN has a vast reach, with 92 million followers on Facebook, and is beamed into more than 100 countries across the globe. Last year, the UK broadcasting regulator launched investigations into CGTN after allegations it aired prisoners' forced confessions and breached impartiality with its coverage of Hong Kong protests. Chinese President Xi Jinping during a media tour in 2016 urged journalists to ""tell true stories of China"", with the understanding that the media ""must love the Party, protect the Party and closely align themselves with the Party leadership in thought, politics and action"". A leaked 2013 document repudiated ""the West's idea of journalism"", saying it undermines ""our country's principle that the media should be infused with the spirit of the Party"".   CGTN has also broadcast panels asking why the West ""ignores the truth"" about Xinjiang, and accusing the US of double standards on countering terrorism. In one, law professor Huo Zhengxin said the documentaries provide ""a lot of concrete evidence to justify the Chinese policy and the measures taken in Xinjiang"", while Global Times reporter Wang Cong said that when it comes to China, Western media outlets ""cherry-pick information that suits the narrative that suits them"". CGTN, The Global Times, and China's Embassy in Australia were approached for comment but did not respond by deadline.  Earlier this month, CNN reported more than 100 Uyghur cemeteries have been destroyed in Xinjiang, investigating satellite imagery and building on other reports from French news agency AFP last year.    But this week, CGTN accused CNN of ""fake news"", claiming human remains and gravesites weren't destroyed, just removed to a new location.    They tracked down Hepizem Nizamidin, the mother of London-based Uyghur poet and academic Aziz Isa Elkun, who told CNN he didn't know what had happened to his deceased father's remains and he hadn't been able to contact his mother in years.  The program criticises him for not calling his mother and shows her gesturing to a new grave where she says her husband's remains rest. CGTN says the old gravesite was ""dusty and unkempt"" and susceptible to erosion, so Mr Elkun's family applied to relocate to ""a standard, concrete cemetery"" close by.  Mr Elkun's distrust of Chinese state media runs deep — ""I don't believe what they claim,"" he told the ABC. He said he had mixed feelings about seeing his 78-year-old mother on screen.  ""CGTN, they forced my poor mother to give an interview … I feel very angry and sad about this reality,"" he said.  ""I was glad to hear my mother's voice — she's alive, but she's very fragile. You can see from my mum's expression, and my sister, clearly they were forced to speak to the media.""   The story, he said, also spells out a fundamental problem, in that China maintains a chokehold on information — Uyghurs overseas have been cut off from contact with their loved ones, sometimes fearing a simple phone call could land their relative in detention.    Rian Thum, a senior research fellow at the University of Nottingham, said the CGTN story in fact showed an admission that traditional Uyghur burial sites had been demolished — even if human remains have been relocated as the report claims.   ""They actually accept that these sacred places have had been flattened,"" he said.  The scale and regularity ""clearly demonstrates that this is an intentional and systematic program of removing traditional-style graveyards and moving the remains to new facilities that fit more of a Chinese cultural expectation of graveyards,"" he said.  He said the CGTN story missed the point about how the destruction of such sites, which hold historical and religious significance and included the graves of saints, was an affront to Uyghur culture.  The Chinese Communist Party has dramatically expanded its global megaphone through propaganda and censorship, according to a report by Freedom House released this week. Senior analyst Sarah Cook, who authored a report, told the ABC that a key tactic of the CCP was to sprinkle in elements of truth to add a hint of authenticity.    ""With this type of propaganda, it's not that it's all false — it's not that it's all completely made up,"" she said.  With CGTN's videos, she said there can be a mixture of real events and victims but this can then be distorted by the framing, or false points of information can be injected into the narrative. Dr Fiskesjo pointed to the case of Uyghur poet Abdurehim Heyit, who was reported dead but then appeared on Chinese state media saying he was ""in good health"", as an example of how China could sow seeds of uncertainty. ""There can always be a kernel of truth in the propaganda, which is then twisted in favour of the CGTN purpose,"" he said. He said the CCP has taken a leaf out of Russian President Vladimir Putin's playbook, deploying a ""tactic of not necessarily denying something but spreading 20 different theories about it"". ""They don't necessarily hope that each and every counter-move they make will be a fatal blow,"" he said.    ""They decided to produce a lot of this stuff and then send it out again and again in different versions, and hope that this creates enough of a question mark around facts."" For Mr Majid in Adelaide, this issue is not merely an academic question but an intensely personal one.   He told the ABC he fears 10 of his immediate family members were incarcerated in re-education camps. ""Uyghurs are at risk of extinction at this stage,"" he said. He added it was devastating for family members to be cut off from their loved ones for three years, only to see them paraded in front of the cameras for political purposes. ""In the morning, we wake up with a worry about our family members. At night time, before we go to bed, the worry still comes into our minds,"" he said. ""Miraculously, we are still living, but with a hope that the situation could change.""

Across the globe, iconic buildings and landmarks exploded in colour and light as fireworks displays marked the end of a decade that will be remembered for the rise of social media, the Arab Spring, the #MeToo movement and, of course, US President Donald Trump.   Auckland was one of the first cities to welcome 2020 with a fireworks display launched from the city's Sky Tower.   About a million revellers gathered in Sydney Harbour and nearby districts to watch more than 100,000 fireworks explode above the city, even as thousands of people along Australia's eastern seaboard sought refuge from the bushfires on beaches. Controversy overshadowed the iconic harbour celebrations amid calls for the display to be cancelled in solidarity with fire-hit areas in New South Wales.   Elsewhere, protests and tear gas rang in the New Year. Thousands of Hongkongers welcoming 2020 on neon-lit promenades in the picturesque Victoria Harbour broke into pro-democracy chants shortly after the countdown to midnight. Hong Kong authorities cancelled the main midnight fireworks display for the first time in a decade, citing security concerns.   A Symphony of Lights took place instead, involving projections on the city's tallest skyscrapers, while smaller-scale pyrotechnics were launched from waterfront rooftops. Pyongyang, the capital of isolated North Korea, welcomed the new year with fireworks displays, while in Seoul, thousands gathered for a traditional bell-tolling ceremony and hung notes of new year's wishes.     In the Philippines, people set off firecrackers in the belief that this will drive away bad spirits and bring good luck. During New Year's Eve, Filipinos gathered for a midnight feast that symbolises their hopes for prosperity and an abundant year ahead.   Thousands of Indians ushered in the New Year by demonstrating against a citizenship law despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attempts to dampen protests that have run for nearly three weeks.   In Pakistan, children held a candlelight vigil to pay tribute to victims of terrorism in 2019.   Russians began the world's longest continuous New Year's Eve with fireworks and a message from President Vladimir Putin urging them to work together in the coming year. Mr Putin made a short speech broadcast on television just before the stroke of midnight in each of Russia's 11 time zones.     For nearly 10 minutes, fireworks lit the sky over Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, as hundreds of thousands gathered downtown to watch the spectacular display. To keep the massive crowds safe, police created walkways around the Burj Khalifa tower for male-only groups to separate them from families and women.   Celebrations have now begun across Europe with fireworks exploding above iconic buildings and statues. Londoners were making their way to the banks of the River Thames to jostle for position to watch a spectacular fireworks display launched from the London Eye and barges near Parliament.     In New York, crowds gathered early in anticipation of the famous 60-second ball drop that will count in the new year at midnight local time, as 1,360 kilograms of confetti falls on Times Square. While Samoa is one of the first places to mark the new year, neighbouring American Samoa — about 100 kilometres away but on the other side of the International Date Line — is one of the last, celebrating 25 hours later. But the party is subdued in Samoa as the country recovers from a measles epidemic in late 2019 that claimed 81 lives, mostly children under 5. ABC/wires	ABC (Australia)
5	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-12/tourism-australia-social-media-influencers/11785634	December 12, 2019	Tourism Australia splashes cash on social media stars, led by one linked to Hong Kong protests	"Tourism Australia splashed more than half a million dollars on social media influencers in 2018-19, alongside other government enterprises such as Australia Post.   But the organisation turned its back on social media stars from Australia's biggest source of tourists, China. Instead, it gave $112,500 in taxpayer funding — the highest amount for any individual — to a Hong Kong singer who has been reportedly dubbed a ""secessionist mouse dropping"" by a Chinese military newspaper. Hins Cheung was born in mainland China but expressed sympathy for pro-democracy protestors of the so-called umbrella movement in Hong Kong in 2014. He has subsequently denied he supports Hong Kong independence. Tourism Australia said all influencers were approved by two managers under an internal framework, but would not confirm whether the risk of upsetting mainland Chinese was considered in its risk assessment. ""He was engaged on the basis that he is a popular Hong Kong singer and TV personality with a strong social media profile and would resonate with the target market of the campaign which was young, fashion-conscious Hong Kong travellers,"" a spokesman said, noting no complaints about Cheung had been received.   ""The results of the broader campaign exceeded all targets, in terms of media coverage, social media exposure and resulting visitor arrivals."" The decision to engage Cheung was made prior to the recent round of protests in Hong Kong. Patrick L'Espoir Decosta, a senior lecturer in tourism at the ANU, said as the marketing was focused narrowly at the Hong Kong audience, the likelihood of a backlash was low — but he noted paying social media influencers was risky. ""Beyond the value that social media influencers may create for brands, products, and so on, the content of what they create on social media is often out of the company or organisation's control. ""This is also true for behaviour which, if it is perceived by the market as negative, can damage the brand."" Alongside radio DJ Ronald Tong, Hins Cheung filmed four short videos that promoted experiences in Sydney and Port Stephens. The footage was broadcast on lifestyle news platform HK01 and Hins Cheung's social media platform. A video shot in Port Stephens has been viewed almost 60,000 times on YouTube, while another set in Bondi has attracted close to 380,000 views.   China provides the largest number of visitors to Australia. Its residents took 126,500 short trips to Australia in September according to the ABS, more than New Zealand (118,00) and the US (69,100). Those from Hong Kong took close to 30,000 trips. No social media influencers targeting China were used in 2018-19, but Tourism Australia confirmed some have been used in the past. ""Approximately 90 per cent of our Greater China marketing budget is spent in mainland China, going towards a range of activities which typically include high-profile broadcast projects, hosting international media and various types of paid-for advertising,"" Tourism Australia's spokesman said. ""Our overseas markets each determine how they allocate their local marketing budgets, depending on where they see the best potential return on investment.""   Tourism Australia's other influencer campaigns targeted India, Japan and Germany. Those paid included Indian internet celebrities Kusha Kapila and Dolly Singh ($20,000 combined), as well as cricketer Shikhar Dhawan ($45,400). ""Social media essentially provides the platforms for e-word of mouth and through pictures, comments, and videos can become convincing, cheap marketing tools for brands, products and destinations,"" Mr Decosta said. Tourism Australia assesses each influencer for reach, whether their reputation is on the rise, how well they fit with Tourism Australia, and how risky they are. The Department of Health spent $266,000 on influencers in 2018 for campaigns such as ""Girls Make Your Move"".   Australia Post has also used social media influencers, paying celebrities such as Angie Kent more than $300,000 since July 2018.   The National Film and Sound Archive spent less, paying $300 in total for a single post about the Heath Ledger exhibition to fashion blogger Janette Wojtaszak.

6	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-09/hong-kong-protest-reporter-yuli-riswati-deported/11669194	December 09, 2019	Hong Kong protest reporter, Indonesian citizen journalist Yuli Riswati, deported after detention	"As Hong Kong's protests grew more violent last month, the ABC had sought to profile Yuli Riswati, an award-winning citizen journalist risking her safety to bring updates to Indonesian migrant workers in their own language.   Despite working six days a week as a domestic worker, she had agreed to do an interview. But when the ABC reached out again, there was silence. As it turned out, Ms Riswati had been arrested and was being detained in Castle Peak Bay Immigration Centre — a facility where abuses including beatings and torture have taken place, according to local lawyers. Her phone had been confiscated, effectively cutting her off from the outside world for most of the 29 days she was in custody before being deported to Indonesia on December 2.   Ms Riswati claims to have been strip-searched by a male doctor upon entering detention. ""Even my family has never seen me naked, so I felt like something was taken from me,"" she said. A report from the Hong Kong Human Rights Commission in 2008 reported that ""strip searches are conducted routinely [by immigration] for people entering or returning to the institution."" The ABC has asked the Government for clarification. Ms Riswati had moonlighted as a journalist for the Indonesian-language publication Migran Pos, which provides news for Hong Kong's large Indonesian migrant population including how to stay safe amid increasingly violent pro-democracy protests that have frequently paralysed the Asian financial hub. ""Hong Kong is my second home along with Indonesia,"" she told the ABC. Before her deportation, Ms Riswati, who has lived in Hong Kong for 10 years, provided an interview to Chinese-language newspaper Ming Pao Daily in which she expressed support for the anti-Beijing movement.   ""I support the pro-democracy movement because it's not just a struggle for them alone,"" Ms Riswati told the ABC. ""My friends and I in Hong Kong will be affected by whether or not there is democracy in Hong Kong.""   Authorities justified her subsequent arrest and detention on the grounds she did not have relatives or a place to live in Hong Kong, despite her employers writing numerous letters expressing their willingness to offer Ms Riswati ongoing employment, food and accommodation. While Ms Riswati's work visa expired in July, her employers had provided a contract until 2021. ""What Yuli faced is unusual practice of the Immigration Department and probably unlawful,"" said Fish Ip, a spokeswoman for the International Domestic Workers Federation in a statement.   ""It is clearly a political suppression against Yuli for her writing, for her speaking up for the Hong Kong protesters."" Hong Kong's Immigration Department told the ABC that it ""does not comment on individual cases"", but that it is authorised to arrest, detain and prosecute ""any person who contravenes a condition of stay"" in the territory. It added that in handling each case, it ""will take into full account the relevant circumstances in reaching an appropriate decision in a fair, just and impartial manner, and strictly according to all relevant laws and established procedures"".   In late September, another Indonesian journalist, Veby Mega Indah, was shot in the face with a rubber bullet by Hong Kong police, blinding her in one eye.   ""Violence against the press in Hong Kong reaches a new high with a reporter being left with a permanent disability,"" Cedric Alviani, a spokesman for Reporters Without Borders, said of the shooting. A full-time reporter with Suara Hong Kong News, Indah has vowed to continue reporting from the city.  She recently filed an application to the High Court to have Hong Kong's police commissioner identify the officer who shot her. Investigating and holding police officers accountable for alleged brutality is one of the five demands of Hong Kong's protest movement. Some observers see Ms Riswati's case as further evidence of eroding freedom of speech in Hong Kong, as the Chinese Communist Party seeks to tighten its grip over the semi-autonomous territory.   ""The information provided by Yuli was very useful for all those who want to get first-hand information from people on the ground, rather than the standard information and warnings from the Indonesian consulate,"" said Wahyu Susilo, director of the non-profit organisation Migrant Care, in a statement provided to the ABC. ""This case shows that there is a threat to freedom of expression for migrant workers from Indonesia and other countries in Hong Kong, and is a violation of human rights."" Freedom of speech advocacy group PEN International's Hong Kong chapter said in a statement it was ""appalled and alarmed"" to hear about Ms Riswati's detention.  ""We condemn this action which may be intended to intimidate non-permanent residents and deter them from involvement in or documenting and commenting on political events in Hong Kong,"" it said.   According to official figures, there are about 385,000 migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong — a number projected to reach 460,000 by 2030.  A vast majority are women from Indonesia and the Philippines. While they are vulnerable to poor living conditions, underpayment and abuse, domestic workers like Ms Riswati — known locally as ""helpers"" — are a significant portion of Hong Kong's cosmopolitan population.   For many, Sunday is their only day off, and they are known for transforming the streetscape of Causeway Bay once a week while catching up with friends and calling family back home. With rallies regularly held on Sundays, it has become more difficult even for those wanting to enjoy their limited time off.   Ms Riswati would regularly forgo her time off to hit the streets and report. ""Some migrants don't like Migran Pos because they feel we shouldn't be involved in politics [in Hong Kong],"" she told the ABC. ""But most of them feel after reading Migran Post they understand more and can keep safe [amid the protests].""   Stories have emerged of migrant workers being inadvertently caught up in mass demonstrations. Some have been teargassed and even arrested. ""It feels ironic to watch Hong Kong citizens' bloody fight for democracy, when my country is a democracy but a democracy that is corrupted,"" said Ms Riswati, whose comments to Hong Kong media came as Indonesia's Government faced large-scale protests in late September. ""If only Indonesians had the spirit of democracy that Hongkongers have, it would be better.""   Back in Indonesia, Ms Riswati said she had ""a lot of plans for the future"". ""I will definitely keep working as a citizen journalist and writing to tell stories, because it's part of my life,"" she told the ABC. Her writing was recognised when she won the Taiwan Literature Award for Migrants in 2018. ""I've already been brave enough to take huge risks,"" she added. ""There's nothing left I'm afraid of. I'll keep speaking out.""  "	ABC (Australia)
7	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-07/hong-kong-unrest-batch-processing-young-protester-cases/11768420	December 07, 2019	Hong Kong's young protesters face years in prison as courts begin batch-processing cases	"'Jimmy' is not sleeping so well these days. At night the 15-year-old boy's mind dwells on the 30 hours he spent in police detention after being arrested during a Hong Kong protest in October.   ""When I sleep at night what happened to me comes back to me. I have nightmares,"" Jimmy, as we've agreed to call him, said.  Jimmy is currently on bail and is unsure if he will be charged with unlawful assembly and contravening the mask law when he is next summoned. The maximum penalty for unlawful assembly in Hong Kong is three to five years in jail, while wearing a mask is punishable by up to a year in prison.  Juveniles given a custodial sentence are likely to serve it in a rehabilitation or youth detention centre.   ""I'm worried about what will happen now. I'm worried that the judge will treat me unjustly,"" he said.  Jimmy and kids like him now rely on a network of support services including legal advice, which is often provided pro-bono. Sally Wong, a 26-year-old barrister, is part of a group of lawyers providing free support for young people who have been arrested in the course of the protests.   ""I see that there are many young people, like 13 or 14, and I think it's quite sad to see them charged with such serious offences,"" she said. ""We think that these young people are fighting for our society … they are willing to take risks of imprisonment for us, so why would I choose not to sacrifice my time for it?""    For Ms Wong and a network of lawyers, supporting children facing custodial sentences is a big job. Approximately 5,800 people have been arrested in Hong Kong in the past six months, and more than 900 of them have been charged. During the recent siege of the Polytechnic University, Sally Wong and her colleagues worked around the clock for several days, going to the police station, and then briefing and advising those arrested and detained. At bail hearings, large groups detained at the same time and for the same charge are being processed through the court system in batches. In one hearing the ABC attended, 15 young people charged with rioting had their bail extended, as did 11 others, including several under the age of 18, charged with unlawful assembly.   Among them was a 17-year-old girl whose parents and brother came to court with her. Her father, who wants to be known only as Terence, said he had warned his daughter the day she went to the protest not to get into any trouble. ""[I said] 'Don't do any violence, don't … attack the police or damage any facilities,'"" he said.   ""My last words to my daughter … on that day [were] 'be safe.'"" Ms Wong said she believed the courts would not show leniency. ""The judge said that we are taking these offences very seriously because we think they really breached the peace of the society, and imposed stringent bail conditions, so I think the court will be stringent,"" Ms Wong said.  A few cases have already been decided.   This week, two teenagers were fined $50,000 and told they would receive a custodial sentence for vandalising a train station. A 16-year-old was sentenced to at least three months in a rehabilitation centre after being found guilty of possessing offensive weapons, including a laser pointer, which protesters have used to disorient police. The most serious charge looming for some protesters is rioting, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years. The protesters have five formal demands of the Government, which include an amnesty for all those arrested and the declassification of the protests as riots.   Hong Kong-Australian lawyer and commentator Kevin Yam is comparing how the courts dealt with similar charges during protests in 2014 and 2016 to today.   ""When it comes to the sentencing from riots a couple of years back, the court is taking a tougher approach,"" he said.  ""From that perspective, that probably gives us a taste of what's to come.""  He said he doubted those convicted of rioting would get the full 10-year sentence. ""But they might get …four, five, six years. If that's a case, that's a chunk off their youth,"" he said. ""We may or may not agree with their methods, but whatever happens to them is just going to be very sad and devastating.""

The man was struck in the head with a drain cover by a masked assailant in the early hours of Sunday morning.  Video posted online shows the man standing among a crowd of black-clad men attempting to record a scene with his phone when the assailant runs up and strikes him.  Police have ""seriously condemned"" the brazen attack, which has been classified as an assault.  In the largest of the three protests, a key thoroughfare along the waterfront on the Kowloon side of Victoria Harbour was packed with demonstrators ranging from hardened masked protesters in all-black outfits to families and the elderly.    They chanted ""five demands, not one less"" and ""disband the police force"" as they marched, in reference to the protest movement's five formal demands of the Government.  So far, only one has been met — the formal removal of a extradition bill that would have allowed people within Hong Kong to be arrested and tried in mainland Chinese courts.  The remaining demands include granting Hongkongers universal suffrage, the release of all imprisoned protesters, the de-classification of a June protest as a ""riot"", and the formation of an independent commission of inquiry into police behaviour. That rally followed two other marches earlier Sunday as protesters sought to keep the pressure on city leader Carrie Lam after the recent win by the pro-democracy camp in district council elections and the gaining of US support for their cause. ""If we don't walk out, the Government will say it's just a youth issue, but this is a Hong Kong problem that affects all of us,"" said Lily Chau, 30, as she pushed her toddler in a stroller at the march in Kowloon.  ""If we are scared, the Government will continue to trample on our rights.""   Police estimated that 16,000 people attended the Kowloon rally. Slogans spray-painted along walls and on sidewalks reminded the crowd that ""freedom is not free"" and pledged ""victory at all costs."" The Kowloon march was cut short after riot police fired tear gas and arrested a few people.  A police statement said minimum force was deployed after ""hundreds of rioters hurled smoke bombs"" and bricks.   Marchers berated police as they scrambled to flee the tear gas, shouting ""dirty cops"" and ""are you trying to kill us?""  Some protesters dug up paving stones and threw them on the street to try and slow the police down. More tear gas was fired at night after dozens of hardcore protesters set up roadblocks and vandalised some shops and restaurants linked to China. Hong Kong's protests have been relatively peaceful during the two weeks around the November 24 elections, but Sunday's disruption indicated there might be more violence if Ms Lam failed to yield to protesters' demands.   Ms Lam has said she will accelerate dialogue but has refused to offer any new concessions since the elections.  Her Government has accepted only one demand — withdrawing extradition legislation that would have sent suspects to mainland China for trial. Elaine Wong, an office worker who was at the Kowloon march, called the recent election win ""an empty victory"". ""We have in actual fact not won any concessions for our demands,"" she said.  ""We must continue to stand out to remind the Government of our unhappiness.""   The two earlier marches Sunday appealed to US President Donald Trump for help and demanded that police stop using tear gas. Waving American flags, black-clad protesters marched to the US consulate to thank Mr Trump for signing into law last week legislation supporting their cause and urged him to swiftly sanction Ms Lam and other officials for suppressing human rights. Some held banners reading, ""Let's make Hong Kong great again"" — a riff on Trump's 2016 campaign pledge to ""make America great again"".  One showed him standing atop a tank with ""Trump"" emblazoned on the front and side. At the other small rally, a peaceful crowd of about 200 adults and young children marched to Government headquarters in the morning and chanted, ""No more tear gas"".  ""A lot of parents are worried that their children are affected, because their children are coughing, breaking out in rashes and so forth,"" said social worker and march organiser Leo Kong.   In Geneva, China accused the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, of emboldening ""radical violence"" in Hong Kong. In an opinion piece published Saturday in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper, Ms Bachelet called for an ""independent and impartial judge-led investigation into reports of excessive use of force by the police.""   She also said that Ms Lam's Government must prioritise ""meaningful, inclusive"" dialogue to resolve the crisis. China's UN mission in Geneva said the article interfered in China's internal affairs and exerted pressure on Hong Kong's Government and police, which ""will only embolden the rioters to conduct more severe radical violence"". It said Ms Bachelet made ""inappropriate comments"" on Hong Kong's crisis and that the Chinese side had lodged a strong protest in response. ABC/Reuters"	ABC (Australia)

Jane Poon, co-president of the Victoria Hongkongers Association, said police were detaining activists because they believed chances of backlash were low as people were mostly avoiding gathering in large groups. Beijing critic Jimmy Lai, the founder of Next Media, was arrested in Hong Kong last Friday. Labour Party vice-chairman Lee Cheuk-yan was also detained by police that day. Both men were held over their suspected involvement in an anti-extradition march in August last year but have been released.   Ms Poon, a former employee of Mr Lai's Next Media Group in Hong Kong, said Hong Kong authorities were using the stress of coronavirus to put more pressure on the pro-democracy groups. ""Less people are coming out because they are afraid of the coronavirus spreading in the community,"" she said. ""[The protesters] are under the stress of coronavirus and the Government still wants to put stress and pressure onto the community, onto the pro-democracy camp."" The Hong Kong Government dismissed the accusations. ""We reject the notion that prosecutions are undertaken for any purpose other than to uphold the rule of law in Hong Kong,"" a spokesman said. ""All the arrests were made based on evidence from investigations and strictly according to the laws in force."" An editorial in China's state-owned media outlet Global Times on the arrest of Mr Lai labelled him a ""modern-day new traitor"". ""No matter how later justice arrives, Lai will never escape punishment,"" it said.   The protests in Hong Kong started in June 2019 in response to a proposal to make controversial changes to Hong Kong's extradition laws.  The demonstrations continued and escalated into a political crisis.   Tom Grundy, editor-in-chief of Hong Kong Free Press, said he thought the Hong Kong Government would have used the lull in protester gatherings to concede to some of the pro-democracy group's demands, or de-escalate the situation. ""We've seen the opposite happen. And the arrest of those pro-democracy figures last week, it's probably a sign of more to come in terms of the crackdown here,"" he said. Mr Grundy said the built up public mistrust in the authorities has ""crashed headfirst into this virus outbreak"".   ""[Last weekend] there was one of the worst scenes of unrest we have seen for weeks in fact, because people just don't trust the Government,"" he said. ""This is a city that has been scarred by the SARS outbreak in 2003. ""It was felt the authorities and Carrie Lam did too little too late because they were fearful of offending China."" Ms Poon and Mr Grundy's comments come as Amnesty International called for an independent investigation into police violence during the Hong Kong protests.   The advocacy group released a new briefing paper on Thursday called Missing Truth, Missing Justice, arguing an independent commission of inquiry was needed to investigate human rights violations during the 2019 protests. ""Each passing day that the Hong Kong Government stubbornly resists establishing an independent inquiry adds to the accountability vacuum and erodes public trust further,"" said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International's regional director in Hong Kong. ""The mass protests that rocked Hong Kong in the latter half of 2019 are not over. ""The authorities may be counting on the coronavirus epidemic to extinguish the unrest, but unless they take action the demonstrations — and abuses linked to them — are eventually likely to return."" Hong Kong's Justice Department rejected Amnesty's call for an inquiry. ""Investigations into police actions and responses to protests will be processed under a statutory two-tier complaints system,"" a spokesman said. ""The two-tier complaints mechanism has been operating effectively under the Independent Police Complaints Council Ordinance which has a clear legal basis, thereby ensuring that complaints against police will be handled in a fair and just manner.""   Mr Grundy agreed that the protests were not over. ""I think judging by what happened in the aftermath of the Umbrella movement, the anger is still going to remain, and I think it's fair to say the protests are only somewhat in hibernation,"" he said. ""The anger is still there, it's still brewing."" There are 105 confirmed coronavirus cases in Hong Kong, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. There have been two deaths."	ABC (Australia)

For almost 11 months, pro-democracy protesters filled Hong Kong's streets, campaigning for a more democratic system of government. Train stations and traffic lights were frequently smashed and infrastructure set alight. Tear gas and water cannon were routinely deployed as the city's police force tried night after night to quell the unrest.   But according to Hong Kong teacher Lau Kam Fai, it has been the outbreak of coronavirus that has finally seen people withdraw from the streets. ""[There are] only a few lunch [protest] gatherings in the week for an hour or so,"" he said in a WhatsApp message. ""Nearly all people are avoiding crowded places or close gatherings or meetings. ""There are some infected cases in which people are affected in the same banquet or church, so people avoid gathering publicly.""   In an article for The Diplomat, Hong Kong-based political scientist Brian Fong said ""calm"" had been restored to Hong Kong's streets ""in an extraordinary way"". ""Since January, street protests have been almost completely halted to avoid the concentration of large crowds under the coronavirus crisis,"" he said. Hong Kong lawyer and political commentator Kevin Yam agreed. ""I think the protest movement was starting to go a little bit quiet anyway before the whole coronavirus situation,"" he said.   ""Then the whole outbreak happened and I think the whole idea of people trying not to congregate in large numbers in close proximity just made having mass protests that much more difficult. ""It's an uneasy calm, there's not much action but there's actually a lot of anger bubbling underneath.""   Mr Yam said Hong Kong's usually busy streets were dead. ""They're more dead now than at any time during the height of the violent protests and businesses, retailers, restaurants that I talk to are saying that, whereas during the protests, businesses were pretty much only down during the weekends,"" he said. ""Now every day is a bad business day for retailers and restaurateurs."" Vision obtained by the ABC of Hong Kong airport yesterday showed a completely empty terminal. South China Morning Post chief news editor Yonden Lhatoo said the anti-government movement had not been quelled, and expected protesters to return to the streets once the threat of coronavirus eased.   ""Oh yes absolutely, they'll be back with a vengeance, you can bet on that,"" he said. ""The minute this health crisis is over, bang, you'll see them all back on the streets, because nothing has been solved, nothing has been fixed, it's just the coronavirus coming along and interrupting everything."" Mr Lhatoo said the Hong Kong government's handling of the outbreak had increased public anger towards it.   ""We've had incidents where local residents have been up in arms about buildings in their neighbourhoods being designated as quarantine centres,"" he said. ""So they've come out to protest against that and when they've come out to protest against that it comes back to the same old problems regarding the anti-government movement. ""And then things get rowdy, police open fire with tear gas sometimes, pepper spray people, so that's still happening. ""Not on the industrial scale that you've seen over the past few months last year but it's still happening very much."" Joshua Wong, a 23-year-old activist and one of the most prominent faces of Hong Kong's protests, was adamant the fight for democracy in Hong Kong was not over. When approached for an interview about the coronavirus-related pause to the street protests, he rejected the suggestion they had come to an end. ""The protest didn't stop and we still continue the strike,"" he said in an email to the ABC.

11	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-27/badiucao-new-melbourne-exhibition-street-art-festival/11995456	February 27, 2020	Australian artist Badiucao's exhibition finally shown in Melbourne after China 'threat' ordeal	"This month, the art of Chinese dissident Badiucao has finally seen the light of day in Melbourne — more than a year after the Australian artist's Hong Kong exhibition was cancelled due to threats reportedly made by Chinese authorities. Reflecting on those past events, the Shanghai-born, Melbourne-based artist told ABC Melbourne: ""I would call it probably the darkest day in my life.""  Originally titled Gongle, the exhibition was supposed to be the kick-off event for Freedom of Expression Week in 2018, organised by the Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP), Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders.   ""It was meant to be a barometer for free expression in Hong Kong,"" Tom Grundy, editor-in-chief of HKFP told ABC Arts. Now retitled Made in Hong Kong, Banned in China, the exhibition features 19 works and sits at the entrance of The Facility in Kensington, where 150 street artists have taken over the three-storey, red brick warehouse and a 22-wagon freight train as part of Melbourne's inaugural 10-day urban art festival Can't Do Tomorrow. The exhibition has premiered at a tense moment in Chinese-Australian relations: this week the Chinese deputy ambassador defended China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak and accused Four Corners of fake news in a heated Q+A.   Badiucao is prolific, responding to global political affairs with his pen without missing a beat.  His portraits memorialise dissident figures and defenders of human rights, and his withering satirical cartoons lampoon Chinese leaders for censorship, rights violations and abuse of power, rendering an Orwellian portrait of life under the Communist Party regime. The Melbourne exhibition features a neon sculpture in tribute to Chinese dissident, human rights activist and Nobel Prize winner Liu Xiaobo and his wife Liu Xa, and a series of distinctly Badiucao cartoons, including a handcuffed Joshua Wong (a prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activist), and China's leader Xi Jinping holding a rifle and standing over a slain Winnie the Pooh (the much-loved honey-seeking bear was banned in China following a viral meme).   Badiucao's signature bold woodcut aesthetic references Communist propaganda art, but in fact owes a debt to German expressionist artist Käthe Kollwitz, known for her portrayal of the downtrodden, including peasants and working class people affected by poverty and hunger during wartime.  Badiucao says that in the 30s, writer Lu Xun (considered the father of modern Chinese literature) introduced Kollwitz's work to a group of Chinese left-wing artists who believed ""art should serve society"" and be a ""form of expression for the voiceless"" — sentiments the artist feels were lost when the Chinese Communist Party came into power in 1949. ""It [art] changed from an expression for the voiceless and became a voice of oppression, and became propaganda,"" Badiucao tells ABC Arts. Through his art, Badiucao hopes to bring Kollwitz's influence back to ""its original status as a voice for the voiceless"".   As the National Gallery of Victoria and four other Melbourne landmarks were illuminated in red and gold last Friday as ""a symbol of solidarity with Chinese Victorians"" during the coronavirus crisis, Badiucao offered his own tribute with two new works. On the opening night of his exhibition, the artist committed himself to a modified interrogation chair, also known as a tiger chair — a common instrument of interrogation in Chinese public security bureaus, according to a report by the Human Rights Watch. For three hours he read from his Wuhan Diary project, narrating a local's day-to-day existence under quarantine. In the exhibition space, a 12-metre paste-up mural featured faces rendered in black and white watercolour, four of them adorned with surgical masks inscribed with a message in Chinese characters which translates to: ""No I can't. No I don't understand."" The message references a document by Dr Li Wenliang — an early coronavirus whistleblower who was reprimanded by police and told to sign a letter that accused him of ""making false comments"" and spreading rumours. According to the BBC, the letter was shared on microblogging site Weibo at the start of January this year, a month before Dr Li succumbed to the disease and died. ""It's a huge tragedy,"" Badiucao told ABC Arts.   But everyday netizens have fought back with an online campaign: ""People are taking selfie[s] and on those face masks they are writing: 'No, I can't' and 'No, I don't understand',"" the artist said. ""They are saying no to [the] Chinese Government and saying yes to freedom of speech."" With the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak declared a global emergency by the World Health Organisation, the artist says the Chinese Government's control of information is ""pushing Chinese [people] to their limitation"". ""That's why we see people writing messages, posting selfies. Dr Li has become a hero, he is waking up [Chinese] people to see the truth about China.""   After his Gongle exhibition was called off, Badiucao went into hiding and withdrew from the internet. Badiucao had previously maintained anonymity, but then Chinese authorities ""actually found my family in China and threatened me through them,"" he told ABC in 2019. This presented him with a serious dilemma: remain silent, hide and hope for safety, or stand up and speak out. Six months after Gongle was cancelled, Badiucao appeared in ABC documentary China's Artful Dissident (which aired on the 2019 anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre) — in which he removed his mask and revealed his face for the first time. It was the same documentary that inspired Can't Do Tomorrow festival organisers to reach out to the artist on Twitter. ""Street and urban art are one of the oldest forms of public protest, and sometimes the most powerful work responds to the political and social world that we live in,"" festival director Zoe Paulsen told ABC Arts.   Not all the fall-out from the documentary has been positive, however: earlier this year, Badiucao withdrew from the Sydney exhibition, The Art of Defiance — Hong Kong: Revolution of Our Time, a group show about the Hong Kong protests, after the gallery owner watched the documentary and ""got scared and wanted to kill the whole show"". At first, the exhibition's organisers announced the show would continue with the omission of Badiucao's work, but after further negotiations, they reversed the decision.  Ultimately, the political cartoonist chose to boycott the exhibition in protest over the original decision to censor his work.   Buoyed by the exhibition finally opening in Melbourne, HKFP's Grundy says they will launch a public appeal to find space and finally display the political cartoonist's ""much needed"" work in Hong Kong ""before it's too late"". ""Humour and satire are the one thing that can undercut authoritarian regimes [like China],"" he told ABC Arts. Following Badiucao's decision to no longer be anonymous, he made the difficult decision to cut all ties to his family, in order to continue his fight for human rights, freedom and democracy.   When ABC Melbourne's Virginia Trioli asked him if creating art was worth that cost, he said: ""If no-one is standing up against it, the more people will have to suffer from it. ""I do hope my individual practice will awaken more people to join me. And only in that case, will we be free eventually."" Being an artist, he told ABC Arts, was ""something that's in my blood"". Made in Hong Kong, Banned in China runs until February 29 as part of Can't Do Tomorrow Urban Art Festival at The Facility in Melbourne.

China launches propaganda blitz to discredit Uyghur #StillNoInfo campaign	"Aydidar Kahar tucks her long hair behind her ear and smiles at the camera.   She takes the viewer on a tour of a mall in Xinjiang — decked out with luxury brands like Versace, Gucci and Dior — before the video abruptly cuts to her sitting at a desk, staring straight into the camera lens. ""Isn't the department store and the subway you just saw an epitome of the dramatic changes in Xinjiang?"" she said, in a video broadcast by Chinese state-owned Global Times. ""Grandma, you have been defaming Xinjiang … people in Xinjiang are living a decent life.""   Her sister Kedirya Keyser chimes in with a monologue of her own:  ""I learned about your misdeeds. You constantly accuse the Chinese Government of engaging in Uyghur cultural genocide. It's totally untrue."" The young women are the granddaughters of Rebiya Kadeer, an exiled Uyghur political activist based in the United States. Ms Kadeer, who was arrested in China in 1999 and later fled to the US, has highlighted the plight of the Uyghur people in China's far-north-western autonomous region of Xinjiang. More than 1 million people from the ethnic Muslim Turkic-speaking group have been rounded up in internment camps, the UN found, prompting allegations that China is committing ""cultural genocide"".   In December, Xinjiang Governor Shohrat Zakir told reporters that people held in detention camps have ""graduated"" and are now free ""to come and go"", but he did not provide evidence. That announcement sparked the hashtag #StillNoInfo, with Uyghurs the world over demanding news about their missing relatives.   The testimony from Ms Kadeer's granddaughters is the latest instalment of what Uyghur activists have called a ""propaganda blitz"" launched by China's state media.  Global Times and CGTN, the international arm of China Central Television (CCTV) news, have broadcast a slew of videos purporting to show the family members of Uyghurs abroad are safe and sound. The ramped-up coverage of Xinjiang is an overt attempt to counter narratives of widespread Uyghur oppression aired by Western media outlets like the New York Times, BBC and CNN.  Paired with the testimonials, in the past month CGTN has also aired ""documentaries"" about fighting terrorism in Xinjiang — which has long been China's justification for what it calls ""vocational centres"" and ""boarding schools"", not ""camps"". But some observers say the propaganda is backfiring and it reveals just how concerned the Chinese Communist Party is about international condemnation of Xinjiang. With Chinese media so closely entwined with the state — it is often seen as the ""throat and tongue"" of the Party — academics said their reports lack credibility.  The Uyghur Human Rights Project executive director Omer Kanat slammed ""China's propaganda videos"" as ""ineffective"".   ""No objective observer can believe that Ms Kadeer's relatives are speaking freely,"" he said. ""They are hostages, in effect, and the video is yet another source of emotional pain for their family members abroad."" Ms Kadeer is not alone — in recent months relatives of Uyghurs including Ferkat Jawdat, Arfat Erkin and World Uyghur Congress President Dolkun Isa, and more recently Aziz Isa Elkun, have appeared in videos circulated by state media. Journalist and academic Louisa Lim pointed out family members of outspoken Uyghurs are often used as ""bargaining chips"". ""This type of coverage undoubtedly depends on coercion, or intimidation, of family members in Xinjiang,"" she told the ABC.  ""There have recently been a lot of reports, for example by the New York Times and others, about how people are selectively and temporarily released from camps in order to say they are safe and sound."" Magnus Fiskesjo, associate professor of anthropology at Cornell University, described the recent videos as ""a sign of desperation"", especially after damning leaks revealed the scale of China's crackdown on the Muslim minority.    ""The regime is noticing that people hear about the abuses in Xinjiang and it is having an effect, so they try to counter that by spreading this sort of propaganda,"" he said.  ""There's definitely an information war that's going on — disinformation warfare attempts on the part of the Chinese Government."" Dr Fiskesjo has studied Chinese televised forced confessions and said videos of relatives discrediting their family members' accounts often took on an awkward, scripted quality.  ""There's just no way that they can say no, because they know that if they did, they would personally end up in camps or in prison,"" he said.  In the past month, CGTN has also released two slick productions, Fighting Extremism in Xinjiang and The Black Hand, which highlighted past terrorist attacks in Xinjiang. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying admonished reporters for not watching the programs last month.   ""I want to do a survey on the spot. How many of you, my foreign friends from the press, have watched these two documentaries? Please raise your hand. Anyone? No. None of you, actually. I'm disappointed,"" she said. ""When those ill-intentioned spread lies about Xinjiang, you flock to hear them. But when the facts and truth are readily available at hand, you sidestep it. Why is that?"" One video highlights the 2009 Urumqi riots, where nearly 200 people — most of them Han Chinese — were killed, and the 2014 stabbing rampage in Kunming, in a bid to justify ""counter-terrorism"" measures.   But Numuhammad Majid, president of the East Turkistan Association Australia in Adelaide, said a handful of violent incidents didn't justify the mass incarceration of more than a million people based on their ethnicity and religious beliefs. CGTN has a vast reach, with 92 million followers on Facebook, and is beamed into more than 100 countries across the globe. Last year, the UK broadcasting regulator launched investigations into CGTN after allegations it aired prisoners' forced confessions and breached impartiality with its coverage of Hong Kong protests. Chinese President Xi Jinping during a media tour in 2016 urged journalists to ""tell true stories of China"", with the understanding that the media ""must love the Party, protect the Party and closely align themselves with the Party leadership in thought, politics and action"". A leaked 2013 document repudiated ""the West's idea of journalism"", saying it undermines ""our country's principle that the media should be infused with the spirit of the Party"".   CGTN has also broadcast panels asking why the West ""ignores the truth"" about Xinjiang, and accusing the US of double standards on countering terrorism. In one, law professor Huo Zhengxin said the documentaries provide ""a lot of concrete evidence to justify the Chinese policy and the measures taken in Xinjiang"", while Global Times reporter Wang Cong said that when it comes to China, Western media outlets ""cherry-pick information that suits the narrative that suits them"". CGTN, The Global Times, and China's Embassy in Australia were approached for comment but did not respond by deadline.  Earlier this month, CNN reported more than 100 Uyghur cemeteries have been destroyed in Xinjiang, investigating satellite imagery and building on other reports from French news agency AFP last year.    But this week, CGTN accused CNN of ""fake news"", claiming human remains and gravesites weren't destroyed, just removed to a new location.    They tracked down Hepizem Nizamidin, the mother of London-based Uyghur poet and academic Aziz Isa Elkun, who told CNN he didn't know what had happened to his deceased father's remains and he hadn't been able to contact his mother in years.  The program criticises him for not calling his mother and shows her gesturing to a new grave where she says her husband's remains rest. CGTN says the old gravesite was ""dusty and unkempt"" and susceptible to erosion, so Mr Elkun's family applied to relocate to ""a standard, concrete cemetery"" close by.  Mr Elkun's distrust of Chinese state media runs deep — ""I don't believe what they claim,"" he told the ABC. He said he had mixed feelings about seeing his 78-year-old mother on screen.  ""CGTN, they forced my poor mother to give an interview … I feel very angry and sad about this reality,"" he said.  ""I was glad to hear my mother's voice — she's alive, but she's very fragile. You can see from my mum's expression, and my sister, clearly they were forced to speak to the media.""   The story, he said, also spells out a fundamental problem, in that China maintains a chokehold on information — Uyghurs overseas have been cut off from contact with their loved ones, sometimes fearing a simple phone call could land their relative in detention.    Rian Thum, a senior research fellow at the University of Nottingham, said the CGTN story in fact showed an admission that traditional Uyghur burial sites had been demolished — even if human remains have been relocated as the report claims.   ""They actually accept that these sacred places have had been flattened,"" he said.  The scale and regularity ""clearly demonstrates that this is an intentional and systematic program of removing traditional-style graveyards and moving the remains to new facilities that fit more of a Chinese cultural expectation of graveyards,"" he said.  He said the CGTN story missed the point about how the destruction of such sites, which hold historical and religious significance and included the graves of saints, was an affront to Uyghur culture.  The Chinese Communist Party has dramatically expanded its global megaphone through propaganda and censorship, according to a report by Freedom House released this week. Senior analyst Sarah Cook, who authored a report, told the ABC that a key tactic of the CCP was to sprinkle in elements of truth to add a hint of authenticity.    ""With this type of propaganda, it's not that it's all false — it's not that it's all completely made up,"" she said.  With CGTN's videos, she said there can be a mixture of real events and victims but this can then be distorted by the framing, or false points of information can be injected into the narrative. Dr Fiskesjo pointed to the case of Uyghur poet Abdurehim Heyit, who was reported dead but then appeared on Chinese state media saying he was ""in good health"", as an example of how China could sow seeds of uncertainty. ""There can always be a kernel of truth in the propaganda, which is then twisted in favour of the CGTN purpose,"" he said. He said the CCP has taken a leaf out of Russian President Vladimir Putin's playbook, deploying a ""tactic of not necessarily denying something but spreading 20 different theories about it"". ""They don't necessarily hope that each and every counter-move they make will be a fatal blow,"" he said.    ""They decided to produce a lot of this stuff and then send it out again and again in different versions, and hope that this creates enough of a question mark around facts."" For Mr Majid in Adelaide, this issue is not merely an academic question but an intensely personal one.   He told the ABC he fears 10 of his immediate family members were incarcerated in re-education camps. ""Uyghurs are at risk of extinction at this stage,"" he said. He added it was devastating for family members to be cut off from their loved ones for three years, only to see them paraded in front of the cameras for political purposes. ""In the morning, we wake up with a worry about our family members. At night time, before we go to bed, the worry still comes into our minds,"" he said. ""Miraculously, we are still living, but with a hope that the situation could change.""

Across the globe, iconic buildings and landmarks exploded in colour and light as fireworks displays marked the end of a decade that will be remembered for the rise of social media, the Arab Spring, the #MeToo movement and, of course, US President Donald Trump.   Auckland was one of the first cities to welcome 2020 with a fireworks display launched from the city's Sky Tower.   About a million revellers gathered in Sydney Harbour and nearby districts to watch more than 100,000 fireworks explode above the city, even as thousands of people along Australia's eastern seaboard sought refuge from the bushfires on beaches. Controversy overshadowed the iconic harbour celebrations amid calls for the display to be cancelled in solidarity with fire-hit areas in New South Wales.   Elsewhere, protests and tear gas rang in the New Year. Thousands of Hongkongers welcoming 2020 on neon-lit promenades in the picturesque Victoria Harbour broke into pro-democracy chants shortly after the countdown to midnight. Hong Kong authorities cancelled the main midnight fireworks display for the first time in a decade, citing security concerns.   A Symphony of Lights took place instead, involving projections on the city's tallest skyscrapers, while smaller-scale pyrotechnics were launched from waterfront rooftops. Pyongyang, the capital of isolated North Korea, welcomed the new year with fireworks displays, while in Seoul, thousands gathered for a traditional bell-tolling ceremony and hung notes of new year's wishes.     In the Philippines, people set off firecrackers in the belief that this will drive away bad spirits and bring good luck. During New Year's Eve, Filipinos gathered for a midnight feast that symbolises their hopes for prosperity and an abundant year ahead.   Thousands of Indians ushered in the New Year by demonstrating against a citizenship law despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attempts to dampen protests that have run for nearly three weeks.   In Pakistan, children held a candlelight vigil to pay tribute to victims of terrorism in 2019.   Russians began the world's longest continuous New Year's Eve with fireworks and a message from President Vladimir Putin urging them to work together in the coming year. Mr Putin made a short speech broadcast on television just before the stroke of midnight in each of Russia's 11 time zones.     For nearly 10 minutes, fireworks lit the sky over Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, as hundreds of thousands gathered downtown to watch the spectacular display. To keep the massive crowds safe, police created walkways around the Burj Khalifa tower for male-only groups to separate them from families and women.   Celebrations have now begun across Europe with fireworks exploding above iconic buildings and statues. Londoners were making their way to the banks of the River Thames to jostle for position to watch a spectacular fireworks display launched from the London Eye and barges near Parliament.     In New York, crowds gathered early in anticipation of the famous 60-second ball drop that will count in the new year at midnight local time, as 1,360 kilograms of confetti falls on Times Square. While Samoa is one of the first places to mark the new year, neighbouring American Samoa — about 100 kilometres away but on the other side of the International Date Line — is one of the last, celebrating 25 hours later. But the party is subdued in Samoa as the country recovers from a measles epidemic in late 2019 that claimed 81 lives, mostly children under 5. ABC/wires	ABC (Australia)
14	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-12/tourism-australia-social-media-influencers/11785634	December 12, 2019	Tourism Australia splashes cash on social media stars, led by one linked to Hong Kong protests	"Tourism Australia splashed more than half a million dollars on social media influencers in 2018-19, alongside other government enterprises such as Australia Post.   But the organisation turned its back on social media stars from Australia's biggest source of tourists, China. Instead, it gave $112,500 in taxpayer funding — the highest amount for any individual — to a Hong Kong singer who has been reportedly dubbed a ""secessionist mouse dropping"" by a Chinese military newspaper. Hins Cheung was born in mainland China but expressed sympathy for pro-democracy protestors of the so-called umbrella movement in Hong Kong in 2014. He has subsequently denied he supports Hong Kong independence. Tourism Australia said all influencers were approved by two managers under an internal framework, but would not confirm whether the risk of upsetting mainland Chinese was considered in its risk assessment. ""He was engaged on the basis that he is a popular Hong Kong singer and TV personality with a strong social media profile and would resonate with the target market of the campaign which was young, fashion-conscious Hong Kong travellers,"" a spokesman said, noting no complaints about Cheung had been received.   ""The results of the broader campaign exceeded all targets, in terms of media coverage, social media exposure and resulting visitor arrivals."" The decision to engage Cheung was made prior to the recent round of protests in Hong Kong. Patrick L'Espoir Decosta, a senior lecturer in tourism at the ANU, said as the marketing was focused narrowly at the Hong Kong audience, the likelihood of a backlash was low — but he noted paying social media influencers was risky. ""Beyond the value that social media influencers may create for brands, products, and so on, the content of what they create on social media is often out of the company or organisation's control. ""This is also true for behaviour which, if it is perceived by the market as negative, can damage the brand."" Alongside radio DJ Ronald Tong, Hins Cheung filmed four short videos that promoted experiences in Sydney and Port Stephens. The footage was broadcast on lifestyle news platform HK01 and Hins Cheung's social media platform. A video shot in Port Stephens has been viewed almost 60,000 times on YouTube, while another set in Bondi has attracted close to 380,000 views.   China provides the largest number of visitors to Australia. Its residents took 126,500 short trips to Australia in September according to the ABS, more than New Zealand (118,00) and the US (69,100). Those from Hong Kong took close to 30,000 trips. No social media influencers targeting China were used in 2018-19, but Tourism Australia confirmed some have been used in the past. ""Approximately 90 per cent of our Greater China marketing budget is spent in mainland China, going towards a range of activities which typically include high-profile broadcast projects, hosting international media and various types of paid-for advertising,"" Tourism Australia's spokesman said. ""Our overseas markets each determine how they allocate their local marketing budgets, depending on where they see the best potential return on investment.""   Tourism Australia's other influencer campaigns targeted India, Japan and Germany. Those paid included Indian internet celebrities Kusha Kapila and Dolly Singh ($20,000 combined), as well as cricketer Shikhar Dhawan ($45,400). ""Social media essentially provides the platforms for e-word of mouth and through pictures, comments, and videos can become convincing, cheap marketing tools for brands, products and destinations,"" Mr Decosta said. Tourism Australia assesses each influencer for reach, whether their reputation is on the rise, how well they fit with Tourism Australia, and how risky they are. The Department of Health spent $266,000 on influencers in 2018 for campaigns such as ""Girls Make Your Move"".   Australia Post has also used social media influencers, paying celebrities such as Angie Kent more than $300,000 since July 2018.   The National Film and Sound Archive spent less, paying $300 in total for a single post about the Heath Ledger exhibition to fashion blogger Janette Wojtaszak.

15	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-09/hong-kong-protest-reporter-yuli-riswati-deported/11669194	December 09, 2019	Hong Kong protest reporter, Indonesian citizen journalist Yuli Riswati, deported after detention	"As Hong Kong's protests grew more violent last month, the ABC had sought to profile Yuli Riswati, an award-winning citizen journalist risking her safety to bring updates to Indonesian migrant workers in their own language.   Despite working six days a week as a domestic worker, she had agreed to do an interview. But when the ABC reached out again, there was silence. As it turned out, Ms Riswati had been arrested and was being detained in Castle Peak Bay Immigration Centre — a facility where abuses including beatings and torture have taken place, according to local lawyers. Her phone had been confiscated, effectively cutting her off from the outside world for most of the 29 days she was in custody before being deported to Indonesia on December 2.   Ms Riswati claims to have been strip-searched by a male doctor upon entering detention. ""Even my family has never seen me naked, so I felt like something was taken from me,"" she said. A report from the Hong Kong Human Rights Commission in 2008 reported that ""strip searches are conducted routinely [by immigration] for people entering or returning to the institution."" The ABC has asked the Government for clarification. Ms Riswati had moonlighted as a journalist for the Indonesian-language publication Migran Pos, which provides news for Hong Kong's large Indonesian migrant population including how to stay safe amid increasingly violent pro-democracy protests that have frequently paralysed the Asian financial hub. ""Hong Kong is my second home along with Indonesia,"" she told the ABC. Before her deportation, Ms Riswati, who has lived in Hong Kong for 10 years, provided an interview to Chinese-language newspaper Ming Pao Daily in which she expressed support for the anti-Beijing movement.   ""I support the pro-democracy movement because it's not just a struggle for them alone,"" Ms Riswati told the ABC. ""My friends and I in Hong Kong will be affected by whether or not there is democracy in Hong Kong.""   Authorities justified her subsequent arrest and detention on the grounds she did not have relatives or a place to live in Hong Kong, despite her employers writing numerous letters expressing their willingness to offer Ms Riswati ongoing employment, food and accommodation. While Ms Riswati's work visa expired in July, her employers had provided a contract until 2021. ""What Yuli faced is unusual practice of the Immigration Department and probably unlawful,"" said Fish Ip, a spokeswoman for the International Domestic Workers Federation in a statement.   ""It is clearly a political suppression against Yuli for her writing, for her speaking up for the Hong Kong protesters."" Hong Kong's Immigration Department told the ABC that it ""does not comment on individual cases"", but that it is authorised to arrest, detain and prosecute ""any person who contravenes a condition of stay"" in the territory. It added that in handling each case, it ""will take into full account the relevant circumstances in reaching an appropriate decision in a fair, just and impartial manner, and strictly according to all relevant laws and established procedures"".   In late September, another Indonesian journalist, Veby Mega Indah, was shot in the face with a rubber bullet by Hong Kong police, blinding her in one eye.   ""Violence against the press in Hong Kong reaches a new high with a reporter being left with a permanent disability,"" Cedric Alviani, a spokesman for Reporters Without Borders, said of the shooting. A full-time reporter with Suara Hong Kong News, Indah has vowed to continue reporting from the city.  She recently filed an application to the High Court to have Hong Kong's police commissioner identify the officer who shot her. Investigating and holding police officers accountable for alleged brutality is one of the five demands of Hong Kong's protest movement. Some observers see Ms Riswati's case as further evidence of eroding freedom of speech in Hong Kong, as the Chinese Communist Party seeks to tighten its grip over the semi-autonomous territory.   ""The information provided by Yuli was very useful for all those who want to get first-hand information from people on the ground, rather than the standard information and warnings from the Indonesian consulate,"" said Wahyu Susilo, director of the non-profit organisation Migrant Care, in a statement provided to the ABC. ""This case shows that there is a threat to freedom of expression for migrant workers from Indonesia and other countries in Hong Kong, and is a violation of human rights."" Freedom of speech advocacy group PEN International's Hong Kong chapter said in a statement it was ""appalled and alarmed"" to hear about Ms Riswati's detention.  ""We condemn this action which may be intended to intimidate non-permanent residents and deter them from involvement in or documenting and commenting on political events in Hong Kong,"" it said.   According to official figures, there are about 385,000 migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong — a number projected to reach 460,000 by 2030.  A vast majority are women from Indonesia and the Philippines. While they are vulnerable to poor living conditions, underpayment and abuse, domestic workers like Ms Riswati — known locally as ""helpers"" — are a significant portion of Hong Kong's cosmopolitan population.   For many, Sunday is their only day off, and they are known for transforming the streetscape of Causeway Bay once a week while catching up with friends and calling family back home. With rallies regularly held on Sundays, it has become more difficult even for those wanting to enjoy their limited time off.   Ms Riswati would regularly forgo her time off to hit the streets and report. ""Some migrants don't like Migran Pos because they feel we shouldn't be involved in politics [in Hong Kong],"" she told the ABC. ""But most of them feel after reading Migran Post they understand more and can keep safe [amid the protests].""   Stories have emerged of migrant workers being inadvertently caught up in mass demonstrations. Some have been teargassed and even arrested. ""It feels ironic to watch Hong Kong citizens' bloody fight for democracy, when my country is a democracy but a democracy that is corrupted,"" said Ms Riswati, whose comments to Hong Kong media came as Indonesia's Government faced large-scale protests in late September. ""If only Indonesians had the spirit of democracy that Hongkongers have, it would be better.""   Back in Indonesia, Ms Riswati said she had ""a lot of plans for the future"". ""I will definitely keep working as a citizen journalist and writing to tell stories, because it's part of my life,"" she told the ABC. Her writing was recognised when she won the Taiwan Literature Award for Migrants in 2018. ""I've already been brave enough to take huge risks,"" she added. ""There's nothing left I'm afraid of. I'll keep speaking out.""  "	ABC (Australia)
16	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-07/hong-kong-unrest-batch-processing-young-protester-cases/11768420	December 07, 2019	Hong Kong's young protesters face years in prison as courts begin batch-processing cases	"'Jimmy' is not sleeping so well these days. At night the 15-year-old boy's mind dwells on the 30 hours he spent in police detention after being arrested during a Hong Kong protest in October.   ""When I sleep at night what happened to me comes back to me. I have nightmares,"" Jimmy, as we've agreed to call him, said.  Jimmy is currently on bail and is unsure if he will be charged with unlawful assembly and contravening the mask law when he is next summoned. The maximum penalty for unlawful assembly in Hong Kong is three to five years in jail, while wearing a mask is punishable by up to a year in prison.  Juveniles given a custodial sentence are likely to serve it in a rehabilitation or youth detention centre.   ""I'm worried about what will happen now. I'm worried that the judge will treat me unjustly,"" he said.  Jimmy and kids like him now rely on a network of support services including legal advice, which is often provided pro-bono. Sally Wong, a 26-year-old barrister, is part of a group of lawyers providing free support for young people who have been arrested in the course of the protests.   ""I see that there are many young people, like 13 or 14, and I think it's quite sad to see them charged with such serious offences,"" she said. ""We think that these young people are fighting for our society … they are willing to take risks of imprisonment for us, so why would I choose not to sacrifice my time for it?""    For Ms Wong and a network of lawyers, supporting children facing custodial sentences is a big job. Approximately 5,800 people have been arrested in Hong Kong in the past six months, and more than 900 of them have been charged. During the recent siege of the Polytechnic University, Sally Wong and her colleagues worked around the clock for several days, going to the police station, and then briefing and advising those arrested and detained. At bail hearings, large groups detained at the same time and for the same charge are being processed through the court system in batches. In one hearing the ABC attended, 15 young people charged with rioting had their bail extended, as did 11 others, including several under the age of 18, charged with unlawful assembly.   Among them was a 17-year-old girl whose parents and brother came to court with her. Her father, who wants to be known only as Terence, said he had warned his daughter the day she went to the protest not to get into any trouble. ""[I said] 'Don't do any violence, don't … attack the police or damage any facilities,'"" he said.   ""My last words to my daughter … on that day [were] 'be safe.'"" Ms Wong said she believed the courts would not show leniency. ""The judge said that we are taking these offences very seriously because we think they really breached the peace of the society, and imposed stringent bail conditions, so I think the court will be stringent,"" Ms Wong said.  A few cases have already been decided.   This week, two teenagers were fined $50,000 and told they would receive a custodial sentence for vandalising a train station. A 16-year-old was sentenced to at least three months in a rehabilitation centre after being found guilty of possessing offensive weapons, including a laser pointer, which protesters have used to disorient police. The most serious charge looming for some protesters is rioting, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years. The protesters have five formal demands of the Government, which include an amnesty for all those arrested and the declassification of the protests as riots.   Hong Kong-Australian lawyer and commentator Kevin Yam is comparing how the courts dealt with similar charges during protests in 2014 and 2016 to today.   ""When it comes to the sentencing from riots a couple of years back, the court is taking a tougher approach,"" he said.  ""From that perspective, that probably gives us a taste of what's to come.""  He said he doubted those convicted of rioting would get the full 10-year sentence. ""But they might get …four, five, six years. If that's a case, that's a chunk off their youth,"" he said. ""We may or may not agree with their methods, but whatever happens to them is just going to be very sad and devastating.""

The man was struck in the head with a drain cover by a masked assailant in the early hours of Sunday morning.  Video posted online shows the man standing among a crowd of black-clad men attempting to record a scene with his phone when the assailant runs up and strikes him.  Police have ""seriously condemned"" the brazen attack, which has been classified as an assault.  In the largest of the three protests, a key thoroughfare along the waterfront on the Kowloon side of Victoria Harbour was packed with demonstrators ranging from hardened masked protesters in all-black outfits to families and the elderly.    They chanted ""five demands, not one less"" and ""disband the police force"" as they marched, in reference to the protest movement's five formal demands of the Government.  So far, only one has been met — the formal removal of a extradition bill that would have allowed people within Hong Kong to be arrested and tried in mainland Chinese courts.  The remaining demands include granting Hongkongers universal suffrage, the release of all imprisoned protesters, the de-classification of a June protest as a ""riot"", and the formation of an independent commission of inquiry into police behaviour. That rally followed two other marches earlier Sunday as protesters sought to keep the pressure on city leader Carrie Lam after the recent win by the pro-democracy camp in district council elections and the gaining of US support for their cause. ""If we don't walk out, the Government will say it's just a youth issue, but this is a Hong Kong problem that affects all of us,"" said Lily Chau, 30, as she pushed her toddler in a stroller at the march in Kowloon.  ""If we are scared, the Government will continue to trample on our rights.""   Police estimated that 16,000 people attended the Kowloon rally. Slogans spray-painted along walls and on sidewalks reminded the crowd that ""freedom is not free"" and pledged ""victory at all costs."" The Kowloon march was cut short after riot police fired tear gas and arrested a few people.  A police statement said minimum force was deployed after ""hundreds of rioters hurled smoke bombs"" and bricks.   Marchers berated police as they scrambled to flee the tear gas, shouting ""dirty cops"" and ""are you trying to kill us?""  Some protesters dug up paving stones and threw them on the street to try and slow the police down. More tear gas was fired at night after dozens of hardcore protesters set up roadblocks and vandalised some shops and restaurants linked to China. Hong Kong's protests have been relatively peaceful during the two weeks around the November 24 elections, but Sunday's disruption indicated there might be more violence if Ms Lam failed to yield to protesters' demands.   Ms Lam has said she will accelerate dialogue but has refused to offer any new concessions since the elections.  Her Government has accepted only one demand — withdrawing extradition legislation that would have sent suspects to mainland China for trial. Elaine Wong, an office worker who was at the Kowloon march, called the recent election win ""an empty victory"". ""We have in actual fact not won any concessions for our demands,"" she said.  ""We must continue to stand out to remind the Government of our unhappiness.""   The two earlier marches Sunday appealed to US President Donald Trump for help and demanded that police stop using tear gas. Waving American flags, black-clad protesters marched to the US consulate to thank Mr Trump for signing into law last week legislation supporting their cause and urged him to swiftly sanction Ms Lam and other officials for suppressing human rights. Some held banners reading, ""Let's make Hong Kong great again"" — a riff on Trump's 2016 campaign pledge to ""make America great again"".  One showed him standing atop a tank with ""Trump"" emblazoned on the front and side. At the other small rally, a peaceful crowd of about 200 adults and young children marched to Government headquarters in the morning and chanted, ""No more tear gas"".  ""A lot of parents are worried that their children are affected, because their children are coughing, breaking out in rashes and so forth,"" said social worker and march organiser Leo Kong.   In Geneva, China accused the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, of emboldening ""radical violence"" in Hong Kong. In an opinion piece published Saturday in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper, Ms Bachelet called for an ""independent and impartial judge-led investigation into reports of excessive use of force by the police.""   She also said that Ms Lam's Government must prioritise ""meaningful, inclusive"" dialogue to resolve the crisis. China's UN mission in Geneva said the article interfered in China's internal affairs and exerted pressure on Hong Kong's Government and police, which ""will only embolden the rioters to conduct more severe radical violence"". It said Ms Bachelet made ""inappropriate comments"" on Hong Kong's crisis and that the Chinese side had lodged a strong protest in response. ABC/Reuters"	ABC (Australia)

Police on Tuesday fired tear gas in the heart of the central financial district and at two university campuses to break up pro-democracy protests. The clashes came a day after police shot a protester at close range and a man was doused with petrol and set on fire in some of the worst violence in the former British colony in decades. A flash mob of more than 1,000 protesters, many wearing office clothes and face masks, rallied in Central for a second day during their lunch hour, blocking roads below some of the city's tallest skyscrapers and most expensive real estate. Crowds blocked traffic on two major roads, with half a dozen of Hong Kong's famous trams lined up unable to move. After the crowds dispersed, officers fired tear gas at the remaining protesters on old, narrow Pedder Street and made more than a dozen arrests ""Our society has been pushed to the brink of a total breakdown,"" a police spokesman told a briefing, referring to the past two days of violence. He said masked ""rioters"" had committed ""insane"" acts, such as throwing trash, bicycles and other debris onto metro tracks and overhead power lines, paralysing the transport system. He said the man set on fire on Monday was still in critical condition and appealed for information about who was responsible.   On Monday police officers fired volley after volley of tear gas in the central financial district, where some protesters blocked streets lined with banks and jewellery shops. Most had their shutters down. Police also fired tear gas at City University in Kowloon Tong, beneath the Lion Rock, and at Chinese University on the other side of the mountain, where protesters threw petrol bombs and bricks at police. Protesters at City University stockpiled bricks and petrol bombs on the bridges and other approaches and were making small devices with nails, apparently to puncture tyres. Streets inside and outside the Chinese University campus entrance were littered with bricks, other debris and small street fires as police tackled some protesters to the ground. A van used as part of a street barricade was set ablaze. The university said some people had broken into a storeroom and taken bows, arrows and javelins that were later retrieved. ""It's crazy that police have been firing tear gas for more than 20 minutes. If they didn't come in, we wouldn't clash with them. It's our school. We need to protect our home,"" Candy, 20, a student, said. Several people were injured, including a student reporter hit in the eye, apparently by a brick, who was sitting in tears as friends offered comfort. Police also fired tear gas in the nearby new town of Tai Po, where protesters took shelter on the street behind umbrellas. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said protesters were being extremely selfish and she hoped universities and schools would urge students not to take part in the demonstrations. More than 260 people were arrested on Monday, police said, bringing the total number to more than 3,000 since the protests escalated in June.   Protesters are angry about what they see as police brutality and meddling by Beijing in the freedoms guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" formula put in place when the territory returned to China from British rule in 1997. China denies interfering and has blamed Western countries including Britain and the United States for stirring up trouble. The US on Monday condemned ""unjustified use of deadly force"" in Hong Kong and urged police and civilians alike to de-escalate the situation. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang urged Britain and the United States not to intrude, saying: ""Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs that allow no foreign interference."" ""We urge the United States, United Kingdom and other countries to earnestly respect China's sovereignty,"" he said. He also told a briefing in Beijing that China's Government firmly supported Ms Lam's administration and the Hong Kong police ""in law enforcement, maintaining social order and protecting the safety of citizens"".

ASX futures were slightly higher but the gains failed to materialise — by 10.40am (AEDT) the ASX 200 was down 0.25 per cent to 6,755 points, while the All Ordinaries had fallen 16 points to 6,860. After closing at record highs last week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq lost ground, after weekend comments from US President Donald Trump dampened hopes of progress in US-China trade talks. The US President said negotiations were moving along ""very nicely"" but more slowly than he would have liked. The blue chip Dow Jones index was boosted by a strong rise in Boeing shares (+4.5 per cent) and managed to eke out a 10-point gain. The plane manufacturer said it expected its grounded 737 MAX aircraft to resume service in January, subject to approval by US regulators. US bond markets were closed for the Veterans Day holiday, making it a relatively quiet session. Global investor sentiment was also hit by escalating violence in Hong Kong, as police shot a protestor during the latest clashes. ""The protests in Hong Kong seem to be increasing the worries of a trade deal, but I think it's just an excuse to take some money off the table,"" Peter Cardillo from Spartan Capital Securities told Reuters. ""We have been quite strong at those market highs last week, so it's just a minor pullback, and I don't think it's going to be enduring."" Yesterday, stocks in Hong Kong fell heavily, with the Hang Seng index losing 2.6 per cent. ""It is the 24th week of unrest and it is still very unclear what can de-escalate the situation. Nevertheless, for as long as Beijing gives Hong Kong latitude to deal with the protests, it is likely the unrest will only have an isolated impact on financial markets,"" said NAB economist Tapas Strickland. The British pound received a boost, hitting a six-month high against the Euro, after Nigel Farage's Brexit Party revealed it would not contests seats won by the Conservative Party at the last election at the upcoming December 12 poll. The pound rose on the news, which is seen as a boost for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his promise to deliver Brexit. Data showed Britain's economy growing at its slowest annual pace since 2010. Quarterly GDP rose 0.3 per cent, which was below expectations, but avoided slipping into recession after a negative result the previous quarter. ""The result took annual growth down to 1 per cent, the weakest in nearly a decade, driven by weak business investment and industrial production — unsurprising given the Brexit uncertainty,"" said Mr Strickland.

Police made arrests and fired tear gas to break up rallies as black-clad activists blocked roads and trashed shopping malls across Hong Kong on the 24th-straight weekend of anti-government protests. Protesters vandalised a train station in the central new town of Sha Tin and smashed up a restaurant perceived as being pro-Beijing, just two weeks before planned district council elections, the lowest tier of voting in the Chinese-ruled city. Now TV showed pictures of a huge red welt on the upper arm of one of its reporters, who said she had been hit by a tear gas canister in Tsuen Wan, to the west of the New Territories.   The rail station was closed in Sha Tin amid scuffles between police and protesters young and old, on a day of planned shopping mall protests throughout the territory. Shopping districts across the harbour on the main island were quiet. ""Radical protesters have been gathering in multiple locations across the territories,"" police said in a statement.   ""They have been loitering in several malls and vandalising shops and facilities therein, neglecting the safety of members of the public."" Protesters daubed graffiti on shopfronts in Kowloon Tong and ""stormed"" shops in Tsuen Wan, police said. Last weekend, anti-government protesters crowded into a shopping mall when a man slashed people with a knife and bit off part of a politician's ear. Hong Kong is in the sixth month of protests that began in June over a proposed extradition law and have expanded to include demands for greater democracy and other grievances. The protesters are furious at what they see as police brutality and meddling by Beijing in the former British colony's freedoms, guaranteed by the ""one country, two systems"" formula in place since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies interfering in Hong Kong and has blamed Western countries for stirring up trouble. Thousands of people gathered on Saturday night at a vigil for ""martyrs"", after a student died in hospital this week following a high fall.   Though the vigil ended peacefully, many attendees called for revenge after the student's death from injuries sustained during a protest. Seven pro-democracy city politicians have been detained or face arrest and are due to appear in court on Monday on charges of obstructing a May meeting of the local assembly, police and several of the politicians said. ""We believe that the government together with the police, as well as the pro-establishment camp, they are trying to escalate the anger of Hong Kong people in order to cancel or even to postpone the upcoming district council election,"" Tanya Chan, a pro-democracy politicians, told reporters on Saturday. One of the arrested politicians, Gary Fan, said the detentions were the result of ""political prosecutions and judicial crackdowns"" by Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam. The elections are due on November 24. Protesters have also called for a general strike on Monday and for people to block public transport, although such calls in the past have often come to nothing. Protesters have thrown petrol bombs and rocks at police who have responded with tear gas, pepper spray, water cannon, rubber bullets and several rounds of live ammunition. They deny using excessive force. Reuters/AP"	ABC (Australia)

Chow Tsz-lok died on Friday after a fall at a building earlier in the week.  The centre of violence was on Nathan Road, in the Kowloon district of Mong Kok, one of the most densely populated locations in the world, where activists built barricades and trashed an entrance to a metro station. Police used a robot to detonate a suspected explosive device after at least three blasts in the area amid a standoff with petrol bomb-throwing protesters. Police fired tear gas there and in Tseung Kwan O, to the east of the Kowloon peninsula, where the student Mr Chow fell from the third to the second floor of a parking lot in the early hours of Monday. Mr Chow, 22, who studied at the University of Science and Technology (UST), fell as protesters were being dispersed by police.   He died on Friday — graduation day for many UST students. His death is likely to fuel anger at police, who are under pressure over accusations of excessive force as the former British colony grapples with its worst political crisis in decades. Police denied they played any part in Mr Chow's death, saying officers were not in the carpark when he fell. UST students trashed a campus branch of Starbucks, part of a franchise perceived to be pro-Beijing, and rallies are expected across the territory over the weekend. ""Condemn police brutality,"" they wrote on the restaurant's glass wall. Hundreds of students, most in masks and carrying candles, then lined up in silence at UST to lay white flowers in tribute. Thousands also left flowers at the spot where Mr Chow fell at the car park, occasionally singing hymns.   In the shopping district of Causeway Bay, hundreds lined the streets in silence, with the eerie hum of the city in the background. Then the mood changed. People started shouting abuse at ""black police"", referring to perceived brutality, and blocked streets in Causeway Bay. In Mong Kok, dozens of activists barricaded off Nathan Road, which leads south to the harbour, and vandalised a closed metro entrance, throwing bricks, there they also destroyed a phone booth in a small explosion.  In Tseung Kwan O, where people had been leaving flowers and silently crying for hours, people screamed encouragement and abuse after a traffic light was set on fire. Mr Chow's friend and fellow UST student, Ben, 25, said the computer science undergraduate liked playing netball and basketball. ""We played netball together for a year,"" he said while crying.  ""I hope he can rest in peace. I really miss him.""   Students and young people have been at the forefront of the hundreds of thousands who have taken to the streets since June to seek greater democracy, among other demands, and rally against perceived Chinese meddling in the Asian financial hub. The protests were ignited by a now-scrapped extradition bill allowing people to be sent to mainland China for trial, but have evolved into wider calls for democracy. They pose one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took charge in 2012. Since June, protesters have thrown petrol bombs and vandalised banks, stores and metro stations. Police have fired rubber bullets, tear gas, water cannons and, in some cases, live ammunition. In June, Marco Leung, 35, fell to his death from construction scaffolding after unfurling banners against the extradition bill. Several young people who have taken their own lives have been linked to the protests. Mr Chow was the first person to die during crowd dispersal operations. The university called for an independent investigation into Mr Chow's death, saying an ambulance was blocked by police cars and ambulance officers had to walk to the scene, causing a delay of 20 minutes. The government expressed ""great sorrow and regret"". A police spokeswoman, tears in her eyes, said officers would find out the truth as soon as possible and urged the public to be ""calm and rational"". Police have denied blocking an ambulance. The car park said it would release CCTV footage as soon as possible. Protests scheduled over the weekend include rallies in shopping malls, some of which have previously descended into chaos as riot police stormed areas crowded with families and children.  Last weekend, anti-government protesters crowded a shopping mall in running clashes with police that saw a man slash people with a knife and bite off part of the ear of a local politician. Meanwhile, seven Hong Kong pro-democracy politicians were either detained or faced being arrested on Saturday; a police statement said three of the politicians had been detained and charged with obstructing the local assembly during a raucous May 11 meeting over the  now-shelved China extradition bill. The others received summons to attend police stations on Saturday to face arrest. ABC/wires"	ABC (Australia)

Mr Xi met Ms Lam on the sidelines of a trade event in Shanghai on Monday night (local time) amid signals from China's central Government that it may tighten its grip on Hong Kong to quell the unrest that has at times challenged Chinese rule. When asked if the meeting reflected Mr Xi's worry about Ms Lam's handling of the unrest, Hong Kong Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung said: ""The reverse is true."" ""The very fact that he is so busy, that he found time to meet, really is a vote of confidence in ourselves"" and underlined the importance that Beijing attaches to Hong Kong, Mr Cheung said at a news conference. Mr Xi ""has a high degree of confidence in the chief executive and also certainly the work of the present Government and the political team, so all these are pretty reassuring to us,"" he added. China's official Xinhua News Agency reported that Mr Xi expressed his Government's ""high degree of trust"" in Ms Lam to stabilise the situation after she briefed him on the crisis.   But Mr Xi also ""demanded unswerving efforts to stop and punish violent activities in accordance with the law"" as restoring order was a top priority for Hong Kong, Xinhua News Agency reported. He also called for more dialogue and efforts to improve people's livelihoods in one of the world's most expensive cities. China's Communist Party last week indicated it may try to find a way to enact anti-subversion laws in Hong Kong, after such measures were shelved previously due to public opposition.   Willy Lam, a Hong Kong-based expert on Chinese politics, said Beijing is showing support for the city's chief executive ""for the time being"". ""It doesn't mean that they like Carrie Lam, or it doesn't mean that they think highly of her performance,"" he said. ""It's just that if they don't seem to be supporting her, then it will be impossible for her to carry out her duty in Hong Kong,"" Mr Lam said. He added that Beijing wanted Hong Kong to enact national security legislation that would give police more power to punish protesters.   But Ms Lam could still be sacked within one year or during Beijing's annual legislative session in March, the expert said. The protests began in June against an extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent for trials in mainland China, which many saw as infringing on Hong Kong's judicial freedoms and other rights that were guaranteed when the former British colony returned to China in 1997.   Ms Lam abandoned the bill three months into the protests, but the movement by then had grown into calls for greater democracy and police accountability and had become the biggest challenge to Mr Xi since he came to power in 2012. The protests in recent weeks have been marked by violence as hardcore anti-government demonstrators set fires and trashed facilities in clashes with police who used tear gas, and as brawls occurred between the demonstrators and pro-Chinese activists.   More than 3,000 people have been arrested since June and in one incident of violence on Sunday, a knife-wielding man believed to be a Beijing supporter slashed two people after an argument and bit off part of a politician's ear outside a mall. Police said they arrested the assailant as well as two men who attacked him. On Saturday, a mob battered a Beijing supporter unconscious and stripped him naked in a scene captured by local media. Mr Cheung said the Government plans to hold a second community dialogue after the district elections on November 24. Ms Lam held her first town hall meeting on September 26, where she endured criticisms for more than two hours from some 150 people selected randomly. Mr Cheung said officials have also continued private talks with small groups of people to find a way out of the crisis, which helped push the city into a recession for the first time in a decade as it grapples with impact from the US-China trade war.

24	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-02/hong-kong-cathay-pacific-staff-speak-out/11657254	November 02, 2019	Cathay Pacific crew say fear of China is fuelling paranoia and sackings amid Hong Kong protests	"Rebecca Sy was wheeling her carry-on luggage through Hong Kong International Airport ready to board a flight to China when she received the message that changed her life.    The Cathay Pacific flight attendant with 17 years of experience had trekked through the terminal countless times before, across its hundreds of metres of tiles and travelators. But this walk to the gates was cut short.  ""I received a message that I needed to return home and wait for someone from the company to call,"" Ms Sy said.  She was summoned to a meeting the following day with Cathay Pacific executives. In the days before, China had made clear it had zero tolerance for staff supporting the pro-democracy protests that were shaking the airline's home city.   When she entered the conference room, she saw printed screenshots of her Facebook posts laid out on the table. She said one showed the words 'happy birthday' she had written on sticky notes for a colleague. Another printout was a screenshot from a Facebook Live story in which Ms Sy claims she had simply mourned the resignation of the company's chief executive.  The third, she said, informed her friends of an impending work trip to the mainland. Her Facebook profile was private, so she reasoned that the posts must have been sent to management by her own friends.    One of the managers asked Ms Sy whether the posts were hers, and she confirmed they were.  ""Then the guy immediately said, 'I have to start the process … you're going to be terminated with immediate effect.'"" Her career of nearly two decades was over.  Ms Sy insists the posts were innocuous, and she believes there was one real reason for her dismissal. Before she was sacked, Ms Sy was the chair of the union representing cabin crew at Cathay Dragon airlines, which operates most of the Cathay group's flights to mainland China.  As the protests unfolded, the union had released a statement defending Cathay staff's right to freedom of speech.   ""Of course … it is the pressure from the Chinese Government,"" she said.    Ms Sy said her termination hit the crew community ""like a bomb"".  ""[My colleagues] would think even the chairperson of a union can be terminated because of her social media accounts,"" she said.  ""That simply means everyone could be sacked as well."" Major demonstrations began in Hong Kong in June over an extradition bill, but have since morphed into a broader pro-democracy, anti-China campaign.    Several large companies have been squeezed between Hong Kong's citizens and China's desire to quell dissent.  But Cathay Pacific is uniquely vulnerable and the highest-profile victim.  Passenger numbers in September were down by about 7 per cent on the same month in 2018, and the airline conceded demand from mainland customers had fallen particularly sharply. Hong Kong's flagship carrier depends on China — and the one-party Communist state knows it. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) issued a ""safety"" directive banning crew who support or take part in demonstrations from landing in the mainland or using its airspace.   ""That changed the whole thing,"" said a current Cathay Pacific employee who wanted to be known only as Jane.  ""It has instilled a widespread mistrust and terror among colleagues,"" she said.  Jane agreed to talk to the ABC only if she could conceal her face with dark glasses and a hood, and if the interview occurred in a secret location in Hong Kong.  She is one of 27,000 Cathay Pacific employees in Hong Kong and has worked for the airline for more than a decade.  Cathay Pacific warns staff against breaching its strict code of conduct, which outlaws any activity that could prevent the airline meeting ""any applicable legal or regulatory requirements"". And whistleblowing policies encourage staff to confidentially report any suspected violation by another colleague.   That has fuelled paranoia and turned co-workers against one another, according to Jane.  She said ""people can no longer talk freely"" about anything political for fear of colleagues informing on them to management. ""It's like there is a dark hole there that everybody tries to avoid,"" Jane said.  ""I think all of us feel that Cathay is no longer the same company we have ever known.""   Some feel the scrutiny from mainland regulators and consumers is so intense that staff are being sacked over issues beyond their control.  A Cathay Dragon cabin crew member who wanted to be known only as Chloe said she lost her job after she discovered a leaking oxygen tank during a flight to Malaysia. She had heard a high-pitched noise during the flight and asked a colleague to double-check the canister.   The entire cabin crew on board the flight was suspended, and Chloe and the colleague who found the leaking tank were sacked three days later.  ""I'm the one who discovered it, I checked it, and I reported it,"" she told managers through tears after being fired. Chloe said Cathay Pacific was ""squeezing"" frontline employees who were ""so scared of doing anything wrong"". ""We are just a used tissue. They just throw you out,"" she said. In the space of just a few months, the airline has been transformed dramatically — and maybe permanently — by political events completely out of its control. Its workforce understands this, but many are also disappointed by the company's response.   Mixe Lee was sacked from his job as a Cathay Dragon crew member for condemning the harsh police response to protesters inside a local shopping mall on social media. ""Hong Kong is,"" he said, before correcting himself, ""was a place with freedom of speech, so I don't think expressing my political view will affect any relationship or especially my work"". ""I still think that the staff and the crews in this airline perform very well as always. But … this company did not deserve a crew like us."" Cathay Pacific declined to directly comment on any of the cases raised in this story. In a statement, a spokesperson for Cathay Pacific said that for staffing decisions, ""all relevant factors"" are taken into account, ""including necessary regulatory requirements as well as the employee's ability to perform their role"". ""Any actions taken by the group with regards to employees is always in strict accordance with the terms of their relevant employment contracts as well as all applicable laws and regulations."" The airline said it also must adhere to all global regulations, ""including those prescribed by the authorities in mainland China"". Most Cathay Pacific journeys pass through mainland Chinese-controlled airspace, including services to Europe and the United States, and the CAAC has demanded crew lists for all of these flights.   The CAAC has lifted inspections on Cathay's fleet, after officials scoured crew members' mobile phones for anti-China content.  The ABC sought interviews with Cathay Pacific's new CEO and chairman, along with the chairman of its largest shareholder, Hong Kong-based conglomerate Swire Pacific. No-one was available. The ABC also contacted the regulator and the Chinese embassy in Canberra, but did not receive a response before deadline.

Mr Wong, who was 17 when he became the face of the 2014 student-led Umbrella Movement, has not been a prominent figure in the current anti-government protests, which are largely leaderless, in the Chinese-ruled city. However, the bespectacled Mr Wong, now 23, holds a high profile internationally and described his disqualification — on the grounds that advocacy of Hong Kong's self-determination violates electoral laws — as political censorship. ""The decision to ban me from running for office is clearly politically driven,"" Wong said on Tuesday. ""The so-called reasons are judging subjectively on my intention to uphold basic law but everyone would know that the true reason is my identity, Joshua Wong."" This year's protests, which started over a now-withdrawn extradition bill, have evolved into calls for greater democracy. They have plunged the city into its biggest crisis in decades, taken a heavy toll on the economy and show little sign of letting up. They have also posed the biggest populist challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. Mr Wong said he was the only person disqualified out of more than 1,100 candidates in district council elections set for November.   Such votes have previously attracted little fanfare and been dominated by pro-Beijing candidates. But a summer of unrest has infused a new significance in the poll and prompted a record number of candidates and voters to register. ""It is questionable whether Mr Wong accepts the People's Republic of China's sovereignty over (Hong Kong) and whether he is of the view that independence and referendum would be options for Hong Kong,"" the returning officer for Mr Wong's district, Laura Aron, said on the decision to exclude him in a statement seen by Reuters. Hong Kong's Government said in a statement that one candidate was deemed invalid for contravening electoral laws that bar ""advocating or promoting 'self-determination'"". It did not identify Mr Wong by name. Mr Wong has said he supported the idea of a non-binding referendum for people to have a say over Hong Kong's future but that he is against independence, according to a post on his Facebook page on Saturday. Mr Wong's disqualification followed another weekend of protests that descended into chaotic clashes with police. Black-clad and masked demonstrators set fire to shops and hurled petrol bombs, while residents in the working-class district of Mongkok poured on to the streets to hurl abuse at police officers sent to subdue the protesters. Embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she expected the Asian financial hub to record negative economic growth this year, in part as a result of the unrest.   ""Our current assessment is that the full year of 2019 will likely show negative growth, which means we won't be able to achieve the already revised-down positive growth of 0.1 per cent,"" Ms Lam said.  ""The situation is very grim"". Ms Lam's gloomy forecast came two days after Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong had fallen into recession and was unlikely to achieve any growth this year. A preliminary estimate for third-quarter GDP on Thursday was expected to show two successive quarters of contraction — the technical definition of a recession. Beijing-backed Ms Lam said the government would unveil new measures to boost the economy once the unrest died down, without giving any details. With visitors deterred by months of violence, many small firms across the city have already closed or are struggling to turn a profit. Protesters are angry about what they view as increasing interference by Beijing in Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula intended to guarantee freedoms not seen on the mainland.

""Let's be honest, the NBA has done a fantastic job, business-wise, getting their feet into China,"" he told 7.30. ""They're not silly, they know that's a multi-billion-dollar market, the biggest market in the world. ""But at what cost?"" Earlier this month Daryl Morey, the general manager of NBA franchise the Houston Rockets, sparked an international incident when he posted a tweet supporting democracy protesters in Hong Kong: ""Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong."" In response, China's state broadcaster said it would not televise games involving the Houston Rockets, and sponsors withdrew support. The Houston Rockets were forced to apologise for the tweet and the NBA issued a statement saying it regretted that Morey's views ""have offended so many of our friends and fans in China"".   Morey also apologised and deleted the original tweet.   The swift reaction from the NBA has seen critics accuse it of kowtowing to China. Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, a Texan, called the backdown ""an embarrassment"". ""The only thing the NBA should be apologising for is their blatant prioritisation of profits over human rights,"" he tweeted.   Bogut backed Morey over his initial post and took a swipe at others who backed China — including basketball superstar LeBron James, who said Morey was ""misinformed"" about the Hong Kong protests and ""wasn't educated on the situation"". 'Everyone is for the ""cause"" until the ""cause"" costs them $$$$$,"" he tweeted.   Bogut said that people may have different opinions on China, no-one should be unaware of what was going on. ""People who say they're not very well educated on Hong Kong and what's going on — it takes all of one hour to jump on the internet and get both sides of the story and form your own opinion,"" Bogut said. ""I think it's pretty obvious what most people's opinions are. ""But if you have any kind of business interest or financial interest in anything in China, you can't state those opinions.""   Bogut is no stranger to Twitter controversies involving China. Earlier this year he tweeted his support of Mack Horton, after the Australian swimmer refused to take the podium with Chinese swimmer Sun Yang who he accused of being a ""drug cheat"".   As a result he and his family received death threats. But he refused to back down, even making light of the incident, calling it a ""harmless joke"". Bogut jokingly tweeted Morey's tweet may have eased the pressure for him, suggesting Morey took some of the ""NMSL"" (ni ma si le, or your mum's dead) abuse.   ""I've been on record saying that everyone, everyone's got a political cause,"" Bogut said. ""You know, they're all for x, y, z, but when it costs them out of their own pockets, people go curiously silent. ""And I think this has been the case."""	ABC (Australia)

Chan Tong-kai, a Hong Kong citizen, was accused of murdering Poon Hiu-wing in Taiwan last year before fleeing back to the Chinese-ruled financial hub. The case was the jumping-off point for the mass street protests in Hong Kong, which have now evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement. Chan bowed and apologised to Ms Poon's family and the public as he left the prison in Hong Kong's rural Sai Kung district after serving 29 months for money-laundering offences. He said he had made an ""unforgivable mistake"".   ""I am willing, for my impulsive actions and things I did wrong, to surrender myself, to return to Taiwan to face sentencing and stand trial,"" he said, but declined to say when he would hand himself over to Taiwanese authorities. He got into a van and reporters gave chase, broadcasting live as the van made its way to an upscale gated apartment complex that they could not enter. While Chan has offered to surrender himself voluntarily, Hong Kong and Taiwan have clashed over the next steps. Embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam held up Chan's case as an example of why an extradition bill was needed — such a bill would have allowed suspects to be sent from Hong Kong to greater China, including the mainland, Taiwan and Macau. The former British colony has been reeling from five months of unrest originally triggered by the proposed extradition bill. The Government announced last month it would withdraw the bill, and the city's legislature formally withdrew the planned legislation on Wednesday. Hong Kong authorities said Chan should be free to go to Taiwan and surrender himself, but Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement it was ""unbelievable"" Chan could be expected to take a flight to Taiwan alone, ""completely ignoring the safety of passengers on the same flights in order to serve the political arrangement of a 'surrender'"".   It said Taiwan had repeatedly asked for legal cooperation. ""We are solemnly telling the Hong Kong Government that you have to take full responsibility for all bitter consequences,"" the statement said. Taiwan has also said it wanted to send officers to Hong Kong to escort Chan back to the self-ruled island upon his release, a move the Hong Kong Government has described as a disrespectful and unacceptable attempt to cross legal jurisdictions.   Chan was arrested by Hong Kong police in March 2018 and authorities there were only able to find evidence against him for money laundering. Ms Lam reluctantly agreed to withdraw the extradition bill two-and-a-half months after anti-government protests escalated in June, although its formal withdrawal is unlikely to end the unrest. Protesters are angry about what they see as Beijing encroaching on Hong Kong's ""one country, two systems"", formula enshrined during the handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997. That formula allows the city wide-ranging freedoms not available on the mainland, such as an independent judiciary. The extradition bill was seen as the latest move by Beijing to erode those freedoms, but China denied such claims and accused foreign countries of fomenting trouble. Opponents to the bill fear dissidents could be netted on trumped-up charges and harbour a deep distrust of the ability of Chinese courts to ensure a fair trial. Reuters/AP"	ABC (Australia)

There has been a surge in interest in Australian properties, with both wealthy elites and professionals preparing to emigrate amid the ongoing unrest.  Hong Kong wine seller Chau Fuk Yau is hoping to move to Adelaide with his young family on a business visa and plans to set up a company exporting Australian wines to Hong Kong.   Mr Chau, 32, said he was leaving partly because of the political situation but also because Hong Kong's high cost of living and weak economy was taking a toll.  ""I think for the education, for the environment, for children growing up, Australia is a good place compared to Hong Kong,"" Mr Chau said. Last week, Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam said she expected the city's economy to slip into a technical recession in the third quarter because of the months of protests.  The anti-extradition law protests have morphed into wider calls for more political freedom from China, but also fuelling the fire is the growing gap between rich and poor and the most unaffordable home prices in the world.  Hong Kong-based, Australian-registered migration agent John Hu told the ABC he had seen a big rise in inquiries and sales since the protests began in June, with many people looking to get business or investor visas for Australia.  ""We have enjoyed a significant increase in monthly sales; our sales have gone up four times,"" he said. ""For enquiries, we are reaching about 1,000 a month and they are asking for different countries and of course Australia is on the top of the list."" Mr Hu said his firm was processing hundreds of skilled migration visas and business migration visas for Australia.   Australia was the top destination for Hong Kong people emigrating last year, with about one third of emigrants — about 2,400 people — coming here.  Managing director of Sydney Sotheby's International Realty, Michael Pallier, said his company had seen a 500 per cent increase in enquiries from Hong Kong compared to last year.  He said the new buyers were Hong Kong people who also had Australian citizenship, permanent residency or who were millionaire investors.  ""The last two months we've seen a large spike in interest from people who are from Hong Kong,"" he said. ""Before it was all mainland Chinese who were coming out. Now there are just as many enquiring from Hong Kong, and obviously with the instability a lot of people that are living in Hong Kong are thinking maybe long term it's better to move to Australia.""    He sells high-end properties ranging from $3 million to $30 million with a lot of clients in the finance industry who want to move to wealthy areas in Sydney with elite private schools.  ""It's not only Hong Kong Chinese, there are just as many expats that are contacting us,"" Mr Pallier said.  ""One has already bought a house from us for just over $10 million, moving back to Australia."" REA Group said searches on its property website from Hong Kong for Australian property had increased by one third from the same time last year with Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide the most popular cities.  Crown Group sales director Prisca Edwards said enquiries from Hong Kong were up 300 per cent and sales had increased by up to 30 per cent for the firm's luxury apartments.  Ms Edwards said a wide range of Hongkongers were looking for local homes.    ""Basically any mums or dads,"" she said. ""What we've seen is someone who has a link, maybe their children already studied here and went back to Hong Kong to work and came back just to see and look for property.""  ""There are some young professionals who already have permanent residency, went back to Hong Kong and lived there … and now would like to buy in Sydney.""  Georg Chmiel, chairman of Juwai, the biggest property website in the world for Chinese buyers, has seen the same trend, with interest in both high-end properties and the mass market.  ""We have seen quite a notable increase in enquiries for Australian properties — up by 50 per cent since the protests have started,"" he said.  Mr Chmiel said the ongoing political unrest was hurting confidence in Hong Kong.  ""What has happened is the confidence has been shaken in the market and if the protests continue that will in the longer term impact the confidence in the Hong Kong property market,"" he said.    However he said the increased interest from the Chinese territory was unlikely to have much impact on Australian home prices because Hong Kong buyers only made up about 1.5 per cent of total enquiries and purchases.  With Australia's strict immigration laws and restrictions on foreign investment in property, Hong Kong people are also looking closer to home.  In a recent survey Taiwan outranked Australia as the number one destination for migration. Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has offered political asylum to Hong Kong people.    Ms Edward said Malaysia and Thailand had become more popular but the US, Canada, Singapore and Europe also remained sought after.  ""Australia is quite attractive because of the weather, because of the time zone, because it's the closest Western country from Asia, but Hong Kong people have a lot of choices,"" she said.  The Hong Kong Government has so far ruled out imposing foreign exchange controls as Hongkongers move their assets offshore.

After two weeks of relative calm, hundreds of shops were trashed and Chinese banks and metro stations were targeted during the major rally on Sunday (local time). Protesters threw petrol bombs at the Tsim Sha Tsui police station on Kowloon peninsula and officers inside fired volleys of tear gas to disperse demonstrators on the street. Protesters set up roadblocks and sprayed graffiti saying: ""We choose to die on our feet rather than live on our knees!"", while others tore up pavement bricks to use as weapons against police. Police used several water cannon trucks to disperse protesters, spraying jets of blue dye into the crowds and sending hundreds fleeing. Police use the dye to identify protesters.   Police also said they seized more than 40 petrol bombs they believed may have been destined for use in the protest. And officers detonated what they said was an explosive device surrounded by broken bricks and left in the middle of a street. The hospital authority said some 24 people were hurt, including six with serious injuries, during the demonstrations.   Hong Kong has been battered by months of often massive and violent protests over concerns Beijing is tightening its grip on the city. The unrest was sparked four months ago by a bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts.  The protests have since widened into a pro-democracy movement. The demonstrations in the city pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power, but Beijing has denied eroding Hong Kong's freedoms and Mr Xi has vowed to crush any attempt to split China. Police had declared Sunday's march illegal due to concerns over public safety.   But unemployed protester Daniel Yeung said ""you can see Hongkongers won't easily give up their right to demonstrate … today's turnout is more than I expected"". ""You can see that as long as people keep coming out in large numbers we are safe and can keep fighting,"" he said. On Sunday, demonstrators sang the protest movement's anthem, waved colonial and US flags, and held up placards depicting the Chinese flag as a Nazi swastika. Many protesters also wore masks in defiance of a recently introduced ban on face coverings at public gatherings, and volunteers handed more out to the crowd. By nightfall only small groups of protesters remained, with one group throwing petrol bombs down a street toward police who responded with tear gas, and another setting fire to the entrance of a store owned by Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi.

Ms Lam, who has rejected calls to stand down, was set to announce a raft of property initiatives, in a bid to restore confidence in her administration after more than four months of anti-government protests. Ms Lam had already started delivering the speech when MPs chanting ""five demands, not one less"" forced an interruption. She left the Legislative Council chamber and came back a few minutes later to try again, only to be interrupted one more time, prompting her to leave again. The expression has become one of the movement's rallying calls, referring to protesters' five main demands, which include universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into what they say has been excessive force by police in dealing with demonstrations. Some of the MPs wore masks of Chinese President Xi Jinping inside the chamber as they held up posters calling for the five demands to be met.   At an impromptu news conference outside the chamber, the MPs then played a recording on a small loudspeaker that they said was the sounds of police tear-gassing protesters and of protesters screaming. ""These are the voices of people screaming and they are just ordinary Hong Kong people,"" MP Tanya Chan said. ""Both her hands are soaked with blood. ""We hope Carrie Lam withdraws and quits. She has no governance ability, she is not suitable to be Chief Executive. ""Please, please, please Mrs Carrie Lam, don't let us suffer any more.""   Security was very tight ahead of Ms Lam's third policy address, with riot police stationed outside and a water cannon on standby. Ms Lam later gave her speech via video link to avoid the jeering MPs and made a plea for peace. She described the current situation as a ""major crisis"" before saying: ""People are asking: Will Hong Kong return to normal?"" Ms Lam then appealed for Hong Kong's 7.5 million citizens to ""cherish the city"", warning that ""continued violence and spread of hatred will erode the core values of Hong Kong"". The Hong Kong leader then indicated her Government would drastically increase the number of housing projects and accelerate the sale of public housing schemes. Anger over sky-high property prices, especially among the young, is widely believed to have fuelled the at-times violent protests that have rocked the city for months. Ms Lam said about 700 hectares of private land in the city's New Territories would be brought back into public use under what is know as a land resumption ordinance.   Before Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997, the colonial administration often deployed the ordinance to take property for public use, offering compensation to landowners. Ms Lam was speaking hours after the US House of Representatives passed three pieces of legislation related to the Hong Kong protests, drawing a swift rebuke from Beijing, which accused the lawmakers of ""sinister intentions"" of undermining stability in the Asian financial hub. One of the measures, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, would require the US secretary of state to certify every year that Hong Kong retained its autonomy in order to keep receiving the special treatment that has allowed it to be a major financial centre. Ms Lam has ruled out making any concessions to the protesters in the face of escalating unrest, saying ""violence would only breed more violence"". AP"	ABC (Australia)

Yet one artist has captured the scenes in a unique way, allowing him to show a different side of the rallies. Hong Kong local and urban sketcher Rob Sketcherman has been sketching the marches as they happen. His images are not that of violence, but of the small scenes that happen away from the cameras. ""It's easy for the media to showcase the fires and the vandalism, and I don't condone that, but the things behind-the-scenes are incredibly moving,"" he told ABC Radio Brisbane's Rebecca Levingston.  ""I usually stand off the street so I'm not obstructing anything. I try to be inconspicuous and I can draw sitting or standing as I use a tablet to work on.   ""The swell of emotion under the circumstances is incredible.""  The first protest Sketcherman drew was during the pouring rain attended by more than one million people. ""I was under an umbrella, walking alongside them sketching for about two hours and you could really feel the way people were united,"" he said.   ""Until recently, Hong Kong was a fast-paced city and people didn't have time for you. But what I've experienced now is the whole community coming together and helping each other. ""It really has brought out a new side of humanity and it's incredibly inspiring to see.""  One of the moments that had stayed with Sketcherman was a man sweeping up rubbish after the protesters had moved on.  ""He was there making sure there was nothing left on the roads and doing his bit,"" he said.    ""Another guy I drew was standing there handing out bananas. He didn't speak to anyone. He just stood by the street handing them out to people who were hungry. ""Little acts like cleaning up the streets or handing out water — these are the little things that show it doesn't matter who you are or where you're from, they are all part of it.""  Rob Sketcherman, who is currently in Brisbane as part of the first Australia-wide urban sketching gathering, came to urban sketching six years ago.   He said he planned to continue travelling the world urban sketching, but worried about the future of his home in Hong Kong. ""Urban sketching makes you open your eyes and realise that there is a story to tell wherever you go,"" he said. ""I've spoken to many young people on the streets and many walk around with their last will and testament in their back pocket. ""When they're caught by police, the first thing they do is shout out their names and ID numbers in case they disappear. ""People feel like they have to lay everything on the line now.""

The climate change activists have begun a week of protest dubbed the International Rebellion across 60 cities from Paris to Mumbai to demand action about what they say is a climate emergency. ""We've got barricades that have recently been used in Hong Kong so we're going to try out what's been happening in Hong Kong,"" Tom Howell, one of the group's Brisbane organisers, told 7.30. ""Cable ties and street barricades together, you can go and get a $40 bike lock, this is a really accessible thing. ""So it's great that we can show that if people do want to take action, disrupt the economy … it only takes a few bike locks, cable ties and some street furniture.""   Extinction Rebellion has already been holding regular protests where they superglue themselves to roads or use devices to lock onto infrastructure. Since April, the group says 160 people have been arrested in Brisbane alone. The activists regularly meet in secret locations to practice protests before they're deployed on the streets. 7.30 obtained access to one of these secret meetings, where they were practicing using bike locks to chain themselves to barricades, just one tactic they have copied from the Hong Kong protests. Queensland Police Chief Superintendent Tony Fleming said it was concerning that the protesters would adopt those tactics. ""I think that would be very disappointing if people were to behave that way,"" he told 7.30. ""I think the issues in Hong Kong and the issues in Australia are probably different and, whilst we are not in the business of taking sides in any particular issue — we're very keen to be agnostic — the fact is … we can all see that is having a significant impact on Hong Kong.""   Chief Superintendent Fleming thinks the Extinction Rebellion protests are already at an unprecedented level and still escalating. ""It seems that their tactic is to deliberately not cooperate with us and not take our help to help them protest peacefully and effectively,"" he said. ""Anywhere you're using power tools or other heavy equipment in order to extract someone, there is a risk there. But of course, we have no choice because we're asking these people to undo themselves and they're refusing. ""The consequence of that is we're having bridges shut down, and we're having all sorts of traffic flow [issues]. And the feedback we're getting from the community is that they're not grateful for that. ""It appears to be wilful and deliberate to try and disrupt the activities of ordinary citizens.""   The protesters believe they have no other options left to get their message across, and claim Australia isn't pulling its weight in addressing climate change. ""We take no pleasure in disrupting individuals' lives, stopping people getting to work,"" Mr Howell said. ""But we recognise the decades of protest, petitions, everything else that has been tried, has not worked. There has been no change; emissions are still rising."" They are calling for the Morrison Government to declare a climate emergency, make a rapid transition away from coal, and reduce emissions to zero by 2025.   ""We are not on track to meet any kind of target that would essentially get us out of this mess,"" Mr Howell said. ""Emissions are going up — that is not dealing with the problem. We're exporting more than ever before."" Resources Minister Matt Canavan said he recognised the right of protesters to hold their particular point of view. ""But they have no right to impose those political views on the vast majority of other Australians who do not support their position,"" he told 7.30. ""What Extinction Rebellion is effectively asking for is a tyranny of the activist groups to overtake free and fair democratic processes in this country. ""What they're asking for is the Government should succumb to blackmail, so that any particular group with a handful of members should somehow be able to dictate to an elected government what should happen, because otherwise they'll do certain things. ""Well, of course, we're not going to succumb to such ridiculous threats."" Ministers in the Government like Peter Dutton have suggested cutting off the benefits of protesters who are on welfare.    Economist John Quiggan agrees with the protesters that Australia needs to do more to address climate change but he believes their demands are unrealistic. ""I think it's what used to be called an ambit claim,"" he told 7.30. ""Clearly, [the protesters' demands] would be very difficult to achieve. But I think in the nature of public protest one slogan used to be, 'demand the impossible'. ""What people want to do when you're making these protests is attract dramatic attention, which they've succeeded in doing. Far more so than more-measured responses from climate scientists, economists and so forth, calling for serious action."" The Queensland Government is fed up with the protests and is now proposing new laws which would include jail terms for activists who block transport or business access, and use locking devices.   Queensland Police would also be given new search powers. Chief Superintendent Fleming said the Extinction Rebellion protests were a drain on the resources. ""We're taking away police officers from other roles that are designed to keep the community safe,"" he said. ""Whether it's actually responding to calls for service — and we certainly have got certain crime types like robberies and domestic violence, which we consider really high priorities.""   He said police would also take a tougher stand against those they arrested. ""When you continue to commit the same offences over and over again, we will look to oppose bail,"" he said. None of which will deter the protesters. ""We're going to keep going until it's done and dusted or until we've failed, which will be some years before we decided,"" Mr Howell said. ""So, yeah, people aren't giving up on this one.""

Ms Lam used the city's Emergency Regulations Ordinances — a sweeping provision that grants her the ability to bypass the legislature and make any law during a time of emergency or public danger — to ban protesters from wearing masks. ""We believe that the new law will create a deterrent effect against masked violent protesters and rioters, and will assist the police in its law enforcement,"" Ms Lam said.  ""We must stop the violence."" Ms Lam announced the measure on Friday night as thousands of masked protesters crammed streets in the central business district and staged demonstrations in other areas, shouting ""Hong Kong people, resist!""   They set fires and vandalised subway stations, prompting police to respond with tear gas. An officer fired a single shot from his gun in self-defence after he was attacked by protesters in the northern Yuen Long district, police spokeswoman Yolanda Yu said. She said a male was wounded, but that police did not know exactly how he got shot. Footage filmed by Hong Kong media company Apple Daily showed a plain-clothes police officer being pinned to the ground by protesters after a gunshot was heard. A police official, who requested anonymity because he wasn't authorised to speak to the news media, said the shooting victim was a 14-year-old boy.   A Hospital Authority spokesman said the teenager was in serious but not critical condition. On Saturday morning the city's rail operator MTR said it was suspending all services because of the damage sustained during Friday night's disturbances. Friday's largest impromptu rally broke out in Central, where many blue-chip international firms are based, as protesters used plastic barriers, wooden pallets and traffic cones to set up makeshift blockades.   Police also fired tear gas to disperse protesters in other flashpoint districts across the territory, including Causeway Bay, Sha Tin and Wong Tai Sin. ""Will they arrest 100,000 people on the street?"" said a protester who gave his surname as Lui. ""The Government is trying to intimidate us but at this moment, I don't think the people will be scared."" Online forums used by protesters also filled with anger and vows to hit the streets over the upcoming three-day weekend.   The shooting came after another protester was shot as he attacked a policeman with a baton on Tuesday. That incident was the first recorded live-fire casualty of the months-long protests. UN human rights spokeswoman Marta Hurtado said the use of firearms was only acceptable as a ""last resort"". Friday's protesters burned Chinese flags and chanted, ""You burn with us"", and ""Hong Kongers, revolt"". ""Youngsters are risking their lives, they don't mind being jailed for 10 years, so wearing masks is not a problem,"" said a 34-year-old office worker wearing a surgical mask, who gave her first name as Mary. Critics said the use of the emergency law was a major step towards authoritarianism for Hong Kong, which has been governed by China under a ""one country, two systems"" framework since British colonial rule ended in 1997. Two activists immediately filed legal challenges in court on grounds that the mask ban would instil fear and curtail freedom of speech and assembly. ""This is a watershed … I'm worried this could be just a starter,"" pro-democracy politician Claudia Mo said. ""More draconian bans in the name of law could be lurking around the corner."" Prominent democracy activist Joshua Wong said the law ""marks the beginning of the end of Hong Kong"".   ""It is ironic that a colonial-era weapon is being used by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Communist Party,"" he said. The last time the law was invoked was during the 1967 riots — a period where more than 50 people were killed in a year-long leftist bombing and murder spree. The emergency laws allow curfews, censorship of the media and control of harbours, ports and transport, although Ms Lam did not specify any particular action that might follow beyond the mask ban.   China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office praised the move in a statement that said the protests were evolving into a ""colour revolution"", a term coined to refer to popular uprisings in Ukraine and other former Soviet states that swept away long-standing rulers, with interference from external forces.   The official Xinhua news agency quoted spokesman Yang Guang as saying the ""chaotic situation in Hong Kong cannot continue endlessly"", and that ""it has come to a crucial moment to end violence and chaos with a more clear-cut attitude and more effective measures"". British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the Hong Kong Government should turn to political dialogue instead of aggravating tensions in months-long pro-democracy protests. ""Political dialogue is the only way to resolve the situation in Hong Kong,"" Mr Raab said in a statement. Face masks have become a hallmark of protesters in Hong Kong, even at peaceful marches, amid fears of retribution at work or of being denied access to schooling, public housing and other government-funded services.  ""The anti-mask law has become a tool of tyranny,"" said Samuel Yeung, an 18-year-old university student.  ""There's no rule of law anymore. We can only be united and protest.""   Some young protesters also wear full gas masks and goggles to protect against police tear gas. Many also are concerned their identities could be shared with the massive state-security apparatus that helps keep the Communist Party in power across the border in mainland China, where high-tech surveillance including facial recognition technology is ubiquitous. ""The broad face-mask ban seems aimed to discourage protests, not to serve a necessary law enforcement function,"" Human Rights Watch's Maya Wang said in a statement. Nearly four months of anti-government protests have plunged Hong Kong into its biggest political crisis since its handover from Britain to China.   ABC/wires"	ABC (Australia)

The shooting, on one of the most violent days of the demonstrations, inflamed anger against police, who have already been accused of being heavy-handed against protesters. The officer fired as the teenager, Tony Tsang, struck him with a metal rod. Hong Kong's Government says Mr Tsang is in a stable condition after surgery. He is among seven people charged with rioting, and faces two additional counts of attacking police. Rioting carries a possible penalty of up to 10 years in prison. Mr Tsang and two others who were hospitalised did not appear in court, as dozens of supporters, many in black, sat outside the courthouse. Thousands of people have since rallied to demand police accountability for the shooting, with many saying the use of lethal weaponry was unjustified.   Pockets of black-clad youths vented their anger, lobbing gas bombs at police quarters, vandalising subway stations and blocking traffic in several districts. Police responded with tear gas in some areas. More than 1,000 students marched at the Chinese University in a continuing show of support for Mr Tsang, vowing to keep up their fight for more democratic freedoms. Police defended the shooting as ""reasonable and lawful"", saying the officer had feared for his life and that of his colleagues.   Activists went on the rampage in districts across the former British colony late into the night, setting fires, blocking roads and vandalising shops and metro stations as police fired tear gas to disperse them. ""Wherever there are protests nearby I'll come … I'm out tonight for a simple reason. You don't shoot a teenager at point blank range,"" said Alex Chan, an interior designer, at a protest in the shopping district of Causeway Bay. ""These protests will continue and we won't give up.""   The lawyer for an Indonesian journalist injured when police fired a projectile during protests said she had been blinded in one eye. The European Union said in a statement it was deeply troubled by the escalation of violence and the only way forward was through ""restraint, de-escalation and dialogue"". The city's tourism board announced the cancellation of a major cycling tournament, the Hong Kong Cyclothon, and the Hong Kong Wine and Dine Festival, citing ""unforeseen circumstances in the coming weeks"". Protesters are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city's affairs despite a promise of autonomy in the ""one country, two systems"" formula, under which Hong Kong returned to China in 1997. China dismisses accusations it is meddling and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up anti-China sentiment. Wires"	ABC (Australia)

43	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-19/tiktok-youth-led-climate-activism-school-strike/11520474	September 19, 2019	Students are fighting climate change, one TikTok video at a time	"Armed with a tripod and an internet connection, as well as a coterie of scruffy lambs, dogs and horses, Tara Bellerose broadcasts a message to the world. From a farm in the Victorian highlands, the 21-year-old uses the controversial video app TikTok to share what she believes are urgent messages about climate change — and point users to Friday's global climate strike. As a young farmer, Tara experiences increasingly unpredictable weather first-hand. This year was supposed to be dry. Instead, it's been wet, flooding her crops away to ""basically nothing"". This is a generation anxious about the future, and that's key to Tara's social media rants, which are raw and unapologetic — and detail what Tara fears is on the way.   Dominated by young people, TikTok entered the wider public consciousness in 2018, as a place for dance crazes, lip-synching and slapstick comedy. When users ventured into politics, it was often small ""p"" — skits about private schools versus public schools, boys versus girls, the tribulations of being parented. And while that remains, there's also room for Tara's irreverent sense of humour as she plants trees and talks about the Amazon burning. As the global climate strike approaches, it's one of many social media tools being used to politically organise.   For the uninitiated, TikTok can seem like an online grab-bag. According to Crystal Abidin, a digital anthropologist at Curtin University, it's the ultimate ""mish-mash"" — with the performativity of YouTube, the scrolling interface of Instagram, and the deeply weird humour usually reserved for platforms like Vine or Tumblr.   The app exploded in popularity thanks to the ease of its video editing tools and fast-moving meme culture, but now, it faces a steady drumbeat of concern. There are, among other issues, persistent trolling, a fine for child privacy violations, as well as the delivery of vast personal data to yet another offshore multi-billion-dollar social media company.   Its Chinese parent entity Bytedance has been criticised for censoring content that is not politically popular in its home country —like videos about the Hong Kong protests, for example. Yet despite such serious concerns, its young Australian users continue to create — and increasingly, agitate. TikTok is popular because, for now, it requires a form of insider knowledge to understand. Dr Abidin calls it ""silo social"". And that helps if you're trying to convince a very specific under-18 audience to get involved in environmental advocacy.   Political advertising specialist Dee Madigan says you need to entertain and engage with people to get them to pay attention to your message, and in that way, the effect is refreshingly ""old school"". ""If politicians get on there, they need to be really careful about how they do it because it would be easy to look like a real try-hard,"" she says with a laugh. Its recommendation algorithm also prioritises local content, which makes it helpful for campaigning. ""It's cultivating a lot of very niche forms of practices and humour that are highly localised,"" Dr Abidin explains. ""It is not too difficult to find like-minded others."" After all, it's operating in a world in which most 13 to 18-year-olds don't always watch the news. Tara puts her clips together using information from sites like National Geographic. ""When I make videos with pretty pictures and cute animals and a dramatic message ... [users] become interested in what I am saying,"" Tara says. On a spring Saturday morning in Sydney's south-east, a group of students gather in an industrial warehouse. As they sprawl on the floor, paintbrushes in hand, the sound of their light-hearted banter reverberates through the high-ceilinged space. But the messages on their placards are serious: ""There is No Planet B""; ""Time Is Running Out""; ""Change Is Coming"".   Sixteen-year-old India is one of the volunteers making banners and posters ahead of the September 20 strike. ""We've been building up to it for a while so it's very exciting,"" she says with a smile, deftly outlining the letter 'S' on a bright red poster. But they're not just rallying in person. Like Tara, India acknowledges the utility of social media in building activism movements among her peers, because that's where they are. ""To build our strikes the past two times … social media has been where we've been doing our organising and our events and Instagram posts is where people are getting their information,"" she explains. Grace Vegesana, the 19-year-old Western Sydney organiser for the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, agrees.   For Grace, who was drawn to social justice through memes and online culture, TikTok's sardonic humour is a product of a generation facing a dark future. She says her peers seek comfort in ""finding that community of young people that are equally terrified but also hopeful that this global issue can turn into something more than a crisis"". ""I guess the Gen Z, millennial thing is to make a joke or make a meme where the humour isn't explicit — it's underlying, it's satirical, because then it forces people to think more deeply about how that humour is being caused or being formed,"" she says. Grace suggests the democratic nature of the app also allows more diverse voices to be heard. ""There's a really big shift away from the Eurocentric and now American-centric views of how social media should function,"" she says. ""You have people from Alice Springs on there who get just as many likes as [a] random white American teenage boy."" For many young people, the strike will be the culmination of months of campaigning and organising.   And it hasn't all been in the form of 15-second musical videos. ""Offline as well, we have that organising happening,"" India says. ""I put all the information on my Instagram or Snapchat, but at school as well I have a little group [and we're] going to try and organise a crafternoon at school and postering."" Thousands of Australian students like India and Helia, another 16-year-old volunteer, are expected to turn up on Friday for the strike. ""It really puts stuff into perspective when you see how much the school strike depends on social media to get our message out,"" Helia says. ""It just gets you thinking: 'how did people organise rallies back when there wasn't social media?'""   Of course, not everyone can strike, and back on her farm, as her horse sticks its snout into her shoulder, Tara thinks she has something for them too. ""If I, say, go out to the protest, then I can share that on my social media,"" she says.  ""And the kids can see all these other people are caring, so they should care."" In a statement, TikTok told the ABC: ""Users gravitate to TikTok because it provides an app experience that is positive, joyful, and fosters their creativity. Our Community Guidelines outline our code of conduct for a safe and friendly environment; for more, please see our Safety Centre.""

ABC News I'd been waiting for this call for 30 years. I'm a news and documentary cameraman based in Perth and surprise phone calls deploying you to a breaking news event happen frequently. But this was the ABC's International desk in Sydney ringing. In the middle of filming a local news story, I'm asked if I can be on my way to the airport in 14 hours with camera equipment, safety gear, gas mask and a helmet. I'll be covering the Hong Kong protests. While I've travelled overseas to shoot feature stories before, this will be my first international assignment covering a big, unfolding news story. Space to play or pause, M to mute, left and right arrows to seek, up and down arrows for volume. After four hours of packing gear, a night's sleep and a quick farewell conversation with my lovely wife (we have a lot of these in this job), I am on a plane with my mind racing. There are a lot of technical requirements to covering news in this fast-paced era. You need to able to quickly adapt to changing situations and this means being very mobile, particularly when covering street protests. The thing I've learnt from years of demanding assignments is that if you can't carry all your kit between two people, it's too much gear. When filming documentaries there is no impending deadline, you can take your time. News, on the other hand, demands up-to-date content, delivered as quickly as possible to different platforms and programs. There are always multiple looming deadlines. When I started at the ABC in 1989, there were no mobile phones. Now we can file 24/7 anywhere there is a mobile network. Share Journalist Greg Jennett at work as the portable LiveU unit feeds out footage via the mobile phone network. ABC News: Robert Koenig-Luck The technology that exists today allows us to buy local sim cards with data, put them into a ""magic box"" called a LiveU, and send vision or even go ""live"", with a slight delay of around 1.5 seconds, from anywhere in the world. This technology has been a game-changer. Ten years ago, this kind of newsgathering was only possible with portable satellite equipment weighing 200 kilograms. LiveU weighs only five kilos, has a battery that lasts for about six hours and can go anywhere there is a mobile signal. Share Cameraman Rob Koenig-Luck and journalist Kathryn Diss covering the protests in Hong Kong. ABC News I land in Hong Kong at 3:00pm and hit the ground running, meeting our South-East Asia correspondent Kathryn Diss at Wan Chai to film a piece-to-camera. I've been to Hong Kong on holidays, but not for work, and trying to move 25 kilograms of gear around the busy streets, in 33-degree heat and 90 per cent humidity, is a challenge. I can see already that staying hydrated is going to be very important. Day two and we are at the airport where three days of planned protests start. Camera operators and photographers look at the world in a different way to others. We are constantly scanning the surrounds for images that best describe what is happening, best tell the story. I am in my element: the scenes are a visual feast. Share Kathryn Diss did multiple live crosses from the airport protest. ABC News: Robert Koenig-Luck We are scheduled to do 10 live crosses into ABC 7pm News bulletins in every capital city but the signal is poor because of the large number of people in the arrival's hall and users on the mobile network. We quickly scramble to higher ground where the signal is better but it's still not strong enough.

 Back Roads cameraman Ron Ekkel. Find out what happens behind the scenes at ABC News and how we produce content for radio, TV and digital platforms. It's already 6.30pm Australian Eastern Standard Time, so we quickly shoot a piece-to-camera (known as an ""as live"") and feed it back on a 20-second delay. The signal starts to improve and we manage to shoot half of the crosses live. Then, we head back into the city to cover the evening protests. After a four-hour standoff with police, there are no significant clashes. I go to bed about 1:00am. Kathryn stays up until 2.30am cutting a radio current affairs piece for AM before hitting the sack. A few minutes later she's woken up — the audio's failed to send and the producer at AM had no choice but to phone. Back to sleep. It's the calm before the storm. The next afternoon, we travel to Tai Po, about 50 minutes from central Hong Kong, closer to the Chinese border, to follow a big march. Because of our live cross demands, we've got extra gear. We walk 2 kilometres with the marchers and then set up on the side of the road in the shade. Kathryn knocks off another 10 live crosses and just as she's finishing up we see a large group of protesters moving to the metro train station nearby. Our local fixer, who is monitoring social media, has discovered that the group is heading to Tai Wai, about 30 minutes away. We hail a taxi and Kathryn files radio copy on the way. Share Protestors erect barricades and block streets. ABC News: Robert Koenig-Luck When we arrive, things have escalated. Protesters have used improvised materials to block the roads feeding into a five-way roundabout. Our personal safety is always our top priority and you have to think ahead in these kinds of volatile situations. Kathryn and I quickly don gas masks and helmets. There is already a cloud of tear gas in the air and we find a safe place to the side of the melee where I can get shots. Share Kathryn Diss editing a radio story on the run in the back of a taxi. ABC News: Robert Koenig-Luck The scene before me is surreal! Bursts of tear gas, police with riot shields, protesters dressed like ninjas with yellow helmets and gas masks, and laser pointers cutting through the gas clouds. After a few minutes, I find it's not easy to shoot with the gas mask on in the heat and humidity. To be effective, the mask needs to make a tight seal on your face. Being hotter in this environment is the last thing you need but it's better than breathing in the gas or being hit in the face by a projectile. Kathryn does three PTC's back to back. Under pressure she delivers, describing the scene before us. It's all over as quickly as it began. We catch our breath. We stop to make a new plan. We check when's our next deadline. We learn that the protesters have moved on to Nathan Road police station and we jump in a taxi to follow. The next scene is unbelievable. The protesters have blocked a busy road in a major luxury shopping district. As shoppers walk by with bags of expensive purchases, tear gas canisters are fired into the group of protesters. Protesters and shoppers flee. Space to play or pause, M to mute, left and right arrows to seek, up and down arrows for volume. We find a safe vantage point. With the mask still on, Kathryn does another PTC, delivering a great summation of the scene before us. I say to Kathryn: ""Hey, this place is literally a riot!"" We both laugh. It breaks the tension for a moment. A few minutes later, I am filming police arresting citizens on the street. About 50 news crews are all trying to get the same shot of a women being arrested, it feels like I'm playing hooker again in the front row of a rugby scrum. It's close to midnight. We need to get back to our hotel and start editing and feeding vision. About 2:00am we are done and head to bed. Share The protests have been going on for months and show no sign of ending. ABC News: Robert Koenig-Luck It's pretty much the same unpredictable chaos in the following days. This is a very difficult story to cover as the protestors break up into smaller groups and are constantly on the move, travelling around on the metro train service. The only way for us to keep up with them is to follow on foot and by train. We strip back our gear to lighten the load. Share It was difficult to keep track of where clashes were occurring as protestors split up and travelled around Hong Kong on the subway. ABC News: Robert Koenig-Luck One day, we follow the protesters on the metro for hours, visiting five different locations all over Hong Kong. We learn that for the first time, police have used tear gas inside a metro station 40 minutes away. We try to get there but trains are stopped. We hear there has been a clash at another place, Causeway Bay, and we make our way there but there's nothing happening, so we go to another location, North Point, where pro-Beijing supporters have been reported attacking the media. We arrive to learn that violent scenes erupted at Causeway Bay just after we left. We head back into the subway and follow a large group of protesters on the move. As we are about to exit the Tai Koo station, all the elevators are shut down. We walk three steep, 30-metre flights of stairs. Just when you think it can't get any crazier, it does! Three vans come speeding up the road, riot police pour out and start firing tear gas at protesters. Here we go again. The next day, Monday, the protesters head back to the airport for a huge sit-in. Tensions are high after the violent clashes with police over the weekend and there is a rumour they may enter the airport with tear gas. We don't believe it but can't completely discount it. I take a video of the crowd from our high position and tweet it. The 10-second video gets over 30,000 views in the next couple of days. The airport sit-in goes on for another day. Kathryn and I are starting to feel the fatigue, but reinforcements are on the way — Greg Jennett is flying in from Canberra and China correspondent Bill Birtles and cameraman Steven Wang are travelling from Beijing — and we'll work with them for a few more days. Kathryn and I take the opportunity to wind down and enjoy a relaxed meal together but as long as we are here we remain on alert. This means when you sleep, the phone is never on silent. Before you go to bed, the camera gear is charged and laid out ready to go, you choose the clothes you'll wear tomorrow, you check how much credit is on the pre-paid local sim card and when it expires. You eat well, drink plenty of water, get as much sleep as you can. The intensity of living at this pace is amazing and a little addictive. The highs and lows are extreme but great colleagues keep you grounded. They become your work family. Kathryn and I laughed that we'd spent more time together over the course of two weeks than we usually do with our partners at home. Sometimes the job is literally a riot. But when you get to tell important stories, and share the experience with great mates, it's the best job in the world. As parts of Australia face up to 90 days of lockdowns, you might be feeling like there's no light at the end of the tunnel. But the world has been here before. This is a pep talk you didn't know you needed. From the ""backpacker cluster"" in Bondi to strange lockdown ""advice"" for Malaysian women, there was plenty of coronavirus news this week. Were you paying attention? In a week, there has been a doubling of COVID-19 cases around the globe, pushing infections over 1 million and New York state recording more cases than China. So where did this come from? The likes of Zoom, Skype and Hangouts have brought an added layer of awkward delays and pixelated faces to our meetings, staff briefings and catch-ups. But there are ways to make the experience less painful and more productive."	ABC (Australia)

Mr Cheung belongs to what Beijing says is the ""silent majority"" in the semi-autonomous city, who are increasingly appalled at the vandalism and violence of recent months. ""It's sickening, it's worrisome. People really feel bad that society is so split,"" said Mr Cheung while attending a pro-China rally in a shopping centre at Kowloon Bay, north of the city.    Hundreds of mainly middle-aged demonstrators turned out waving Chinese flags, singing the national anthem and cheering on riot police. They jeered counter-protesters, or ""rioters"" as they call them, and loudly cheered when several were chased down and taken away in handcuffs, after fist fights broke out between members of opposing camps.  ""We call them cockroaches because they're despised by many of us here in Hong Kong. ""They are not making any contribution, they are destroying public utilities"", said Mr Cheung.  Over the three months of protests, the demonstrators opposing a now-scrapped extradition plan for mainland China and pushing for more police scrutiny have brought out the largest crowds for rallies, sometimes in excess of a million people.    But pro-police rallies, which often include patriotic supporters of the Chinese Government, have at their peak mobilised tens of thousands — though organisers say they are much larger.  Critics of the pro-Government rallies say some attendees are bussed in from across the border in mainland China, something Mr Cheung concedes is possible judging from peoples' accents.  But in recent weeks, pro-China groups of local citizens have become more vocal — scaling a prominent lookout to wave the flag, and organising national anthem singalongs to respond to protesters who popularised a new anthem for Hong Kong.  ""The news young people get from the media or their peers is biased,"" said Leo Chong, a surgeon who attended one of the rallies to support police.    ""Look at [popular media outlet] Apple Daily, it really is a spy paper, everything about China is negative,"" he said. Others blame Hong Kong's education curriculum, saying it doesn't teach the younger generation enough about Chinese history, British colonialism or the achievements of the Communist Party, which are glorified in the mainland through a separate patriotic education curriculum.  ""I think a lot of young people in Hong Kong misunderstand what's going on"", said Mark Tam, a retired superintendent who now does business in the mainland.  ""People say they don't support the judicial system in China but at least it's far better than in the past,"" he said.  It's common to hear about generational gaps within families over the protests. While the peaceful marches against China bring out a diverse cross-section of Hong Kong society, the vandalism and violent clashes with police tend to be carried out by younger ""frontliners"".   Though the pro-China rallies can't compete for numbers on the streets, they do have a powerful supporter — China's Government.    During recent media conferences from the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office, officials in Beijing praised an older man who swatted away a flyer from a protester at the city's airport. They also highlighted a resident seen in a viral video arguing with protesters as they tried to disrupt trains. With no easy options to bring the protests to an end, Beijing has appealed for ""all those who care about Hong Kong's future [to] step up firmly to stop the violence and restore order"". It's a call Mr Cheung is happy to answer. He rejects protester concerns about the Communist Party's authoritarian political system, and maintains optimism despite the unrest. ""We just want people to know there are a lot of people here supporting the country, supporting the Hong Kong Government and supporting the police,"" he said."	ABC (Australia)

48	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-12/gold-shines-during-times-of-crisis/11261596	September 12, 2019	Gold shines during times of crisis — so how can you get in on it?	"Good news is bad news when it comes to gold and the geopolitical tensions roiling other markets this year have seen prices surge, increasing demand for an investment you can feel and touch.   ""For thousands and thousands of years, gold has been seen as that ultimate store of wealth,"" the Perth Mint's chief executive Richard Hayes said.  In recent months, demand has risen, with central banks buying up gold and money flowing into gold-backed exchange traded funds. From treasure chests at the bottom of the ocean to jewellery traded at a pawn shop, gold has been a symbol of enduring riches and convertible wealth. ""You can go back through history, it's been used as money, it's been a tool to base currency off,"" said InvestSMART chief market strategist Evan Lucas.  ""Nowadays, it's basically seen as a way of storing the value of your money against volatility in markets or a slowdown in the economy."" In June, as the Perth Mint celebrated its 120th anniversary and the G20 meeting loomed, the Australian dollar gold price broke above $2,000 an ounce for the first time.    ""Its price in Australian dollars is really a factor of both the underlying US dollar gold price and the current weakness in the Australian dollar,"" Mr Hayes said. There has been no shortage of global uncertainty driving the gold price higher this year — from the ongoing US-China trade war, slowing global growth and recession fears, tensions between the US and Iran, the Hong Kong protests and the ongoing Brexit saga. Another reason investors have flocked to gold this year is the fall in global interest rates. ""When interest rates go down and central banks continue to pump that liquidity into the system, that means money losses its value. When that happens you've got to hold on to assets, real hard assets,"" said Tribeca Investment Partners portfolio manager Jun Bei Lui. As bond yields fall to multi-year lows, and in some cases turn negative, gold has become more attractive. ""The very low interest rates means the cost of carrying gold, which doesn't bear interest, is negligible,"" said Nicholas Frappell from gold dealer ABC Bullion.   ""Gold is more likely to not only hold its value but in times of volatility, in times of risk, we have seen it move up higher, it actually appreciates,"" Evan Lucas said. However, what goes up can also go down. While the price hit an all-time high above $US1,800 an ounce during the US debt-ceiling crisis of 2011, it fell back below $US1,100 in 2015. This year, central banks have been among the big gold buyers, including Poland, Russia, China and Turkey. In the first six months of this year, more than 374 tonnes of gold was bought by central banks — up 57 per cent on the same period last year, with demand at the highest level since 2010. Many Australians hold gold as part of a diversified portfolio in their superannuation fund. ""Under a lot of super fund mandates — what they have to invest in at certain percentages or sizes — gold would probably be a part of that,"" Mr Lucas said, noting that exposures to gold vary depending on how conservative a fund is.   ""In Australia, there are people with [self-managed super funds] who are seeking to diversify their portfolios. Overseas, a lot of managed money funds are placing their money into gold … it's a diversified group of people but mainly private investors,"" ABC Bullion's Nicholas Frappell said. Exchange traded funds [ETFs] — investment funds holding assets and traded on stock exchanges — are another way to invest in gold. In the second quarter of this year, holdings of gold-backed ETFs reached a six-year high of 2,548 tonnes, according to the World Gold Council. ""You can go on the ASX and buy and sell that ETF the same as you'd by and sell any share, whether that's CommBank, BHP or what have you,"" said Mr Lucas. ""The [ETF] product is designed to basically replicate the amount of gold the fund is holding … it is much more liquid that going and buying it physically or going through a broker, but you don't actually hold the physical gold itself.""   Alternatively, investors can buy shares in gold mining companies. The biggest players listed on the Australian stock market are Newcrest Mining, Evolution Mining and Northern Star Resources. While gold stocks tend to be some of the only outperformers on a particularly bad day on the share market, the same sized stock price movements can be seen in the opposite direction. ""You're buying the company risk of whatever gold stock that is, on top of the underlying gold price,"" said Mr Lucas. ""The catch is, unlike [the gold price] which may move 1 or 2 per cent, gold stocks might move between 4 and 10 per cent, depending on which one you've looked at, so there are pros and cons to it."" Tribeca's Jun Bei Lui agrees the gold miners can be volatile stocks, noting that smaller miners often raise capital to ramp up exploration when the gold price is high, but the fruits of that exploration can be years away. ""You need to be cautious putting too many of your eggs in one basket in that respect … the junior gold miners tend to be a lot more high risk."" For some, holding gold through their superannuation fund or getting exposure through an ETF is not enough — they want to see it in their hand. ""It's something people respond to … investors definitely like having a tangible product that has no debt connected with it, that's a really powerful draw,"" ABC Bullion's Nicholas Frappell observed.   Physical gold can be allocated specifically to the buyer and held in storage under their name, or it can be held as part of a pool account. Pools can be allocated, where a certain portion of physical gold is set aside for a group of clients, or unallocated, which avoids storage fees but means the buyer is essentially a creditor of the bank or dealer, potentially leaving them vulnerable if that institution goes bust. Below the streets of Sydney's CBD, investors store gold and other valuables in safety deposit boxes inside a vault. ""People like physical gold because it's easy to store, it's easily accessible, you've got guaranteed access to the gold that you buy and, of course, if you've got a vault in Sydney as we have, particularly domestic buyers have a lot of confidence,"" said Mr Frappell. ""Whereas, ETFs for example, usually you're quite remote from your gold, because the ETF will be based in another financial hub.""   However, InvestSMART's Evan Lucas channelled a vocal gold critic, billionaire investor Warren Buffet, in his assessment of the precious metal. ""Gold doesn't make you any money — it's not giving you a yield, it's not giving you a dividend, it's not producing anything or growing, it's not anything other than an inert piece of metal. ""There is always a catch to looking at safe havens. Yes, right here and now they might be able to give you some capital appreciation and buffer you from the risks that may be coming, whether it be in bond markets, equities markets or the cash market, but, like any market, it does move the other way as well."" For those holding gold, some forecasts have suggested the price rally may have further to run. Citi analysts are bullish on the gold price outlook, saying prices could possibly breach $US2,000 an ounce in the next year or two, if global growth and recession fears are realised and interest rates remain lower for longer."

Never has that been more clear than now.  In fact, it is fair to say the world is in a democratic recession. Political scientist Yascha Mounk points out in the latest edition of Foreign Affairs journal: ""For the first time since the last 19th century, the cumulative GDP of autocracies now equals of exceeds that of Western liberal democracies"". Democracy is being assailed from without and within: on the one hand the rise of autocratic regimes, specifically China, and on the other the dominance of global multilateralism that has weakened national sovereignty.  Both have sparked a blowback. Which is where Brexit and the Hong Kong protests come in.  They are movements geographically worlds apart yet linked by history and a common desire for people to hold on to time worn traditions and identity. Hong Kong was a reminder to Beijing of what the Chinese people refer to as the ""century of humiliation"".  Its return to the motherland in 1997, symbolised China's resurgent power and crowned what we now call the Asian Century.   At a tense moment in negotiations then Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, turned to British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, and warned that the Chinese army could just march in and take it. Today Britain has faded as a global power and China is the only rival to American global dominance. Both events sit at the hinge point of history.  Liberalism and democracy are being challenged right at the moment when authoritarianism appears to be ascendant. Chinese leader Xi Jinping is the embodiment of this. He is a populist nationalist, now President for life, whose ""China Dream"" rejects western values.  He leverages his nation's financial might to build a network of transactional relationship that brings countries from the Pacific, to Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa ever closer to Beijing's orbit.   He speaks of a ""harmonious society"", but achieves it by force: locking up dissidents, silencing freedom of expression, suppressing ethnic Tibetans and Uighur Muslims. Hong Kong is the mouse that roared. The summer of people power has challenged the Xi iron fist. It is an assertion of identity against Communist Party one-China rule. It exposes Xi's weakness: for all of China's increasing military strength and global reach the Communist Party lacks legitimacy.  It rules by the promise of making people rich; Hong Kong was already rich, a virulent anti-western Chinese nationalism and fear.  In spite of its impressive economic revolution, it remains what China watcher, Susan Shirk, has dubbed ""a fragile superpower"". No one knows how the Hong Kong protests will turn out. Xi has shown restraint thus far. But the worst fears are of an eventual Tiananmen Square type crackdown: a horrific thought. The demonstrations may burn themselves out. The protesters could sabotage their own ends by the crowds becoming more raucous, unruly and violent, losing public and international support. What is clear though: China's rise to global superpower, while still on track, is not a fait accompli and will certainly not be a smooth process.   Over in Britain the glories of empire have long faded.  It is caught between a future pooling its sovereignty with Europe or breaking away with all the uncertainty and upheaval that involves.   Brexit is a mess. It has cost two Prime Ministers, Cameron and May, and produced a cleavage in British social and political life.  The cosmopolitan city dwellers are pro-Europe, the regions want out.  There are two Britains: what political writer, David Goodhart, has succinctly dubbed ""the somewheres"", wedded to tradition and community, and the ""anywheres"", globe trotting elites. In anywheres circles it is fashionable to mock the somewhere Brexiteers as unsophisticated, ill-informed bigots longing for an old white Britain long past. These same anywheres would just as likely be cheering the Hong Kong protesters from afar.    Yet, aren't those in Hong Kong also fighting for their identity? Our age is defined by challenges to democracy, from authoritarian behemoths like China and from a liberal globalisation, open borders, free trade, that has led to increasing inequality, a distrust of politics, a loss of cultural cohesion. An oft-repeated complaint by people that they ""have lost their countries"" has sparked a populist backlash against immigration and given rise to an arch-nationalism that feeds off fear and xenophobia.  It is ripe pickings for cynical, even dangerous, populist politicians. It is a paradox of globalism that as it has helped to share prosperity and spread democracy it has also made it easier for China to wield its influence by including it in its frameworks and institutions like the World Trade Organisation.  China did not have to liberalise, it could take the best of economic freedom and double down on its stranglehold on power at home.  Little wonder that a Communist Party authoritarian like Xi a few years ago at the Global Economic Forum could proclaim himself, with no irony, a champion of globalism. Globalism and authoritarianism: each in their own way, twin threats to democracy that link the people of Hong Kong and Britain. If the Hong Kong protesters are the voices against mainland China dominance then the pro-Brexit voters are voices against European rule, the perceived hegemony of France and Germany, and a desire for Britain to take back control of its borders and economy.   The 21st century may see the death of democracy.  What is upheld as the global liberal order, the bedrock of international cooperation and growth since World War II, is on tilt. Both movements in Hong Kong and Britain may prove a vain last gasp resistance against the tides of history.  The return of authoritarianism and the reality of globalism may well be set in stone. They may presage a very different global order, the shape of which is not yet known. If yes, then as we admire the Hong Kong protesters we must respect the Brexit voters.  It is the will of the British people to exit Europe. They have expressed their democratic right, a treasured British inheritance the people of Hong Kong are also staring down the might of Beijing to uphold. Brexit may not prove the wisest decision, it has already wreaked political havoc, but democracy does not always guarantee wisdom.  Democracy throws up poor leaders and bad policy. Democracy means having the right to get it wrong.  But it offers the chance to right the wrong. And that is just what the people of Hong Kong are fighting for."	ABC (Australia)
54	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-03/hong-kong-protesters-in-australia-to-meet-with-students/11470398	September 03, 2019	Hong Kong student protest delegation arrives in Australia amid fears of 'another Tiananmen Square'	"One leader of a student-led Hong Kong pro-democracy delegation to Australia says the city's residents fear it may become ""another Tiananmen Square"" as continued unrest in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory ticks over into its third month.    The former British colony has been seething with unrest following the decision by the city's leader to introduce a controversial extradition bill that would have allowed Beijing to arrest political dissidents in Hong Kong.  While the bill has since been suspended, the demonstrations have voiced broader existential concerns about the future of the city's autonomy under Chinese communist rule in addition to calls to investigate alleged acts of police brutality against protesters.  Sunny Cheung, 23, a student at Hong Kong University and pro-democracy protest leader in Australia, told the ABC that any attempt to launch a Tiananmen Square-style crackdown on student protesters would be counter-intuitive.  ""If Beijing tried to send in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to crack down on Hong Kong, they would lose [it] immediately as an international financial hub,"" Mr Cheung said.  Mr Cheung was referring to China's 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, where over 200,000 PLA troops descended on demonstrators to violently quash demonstrations that had been running for months. Estimates of the death toll have ranged from a few hundred to several thousand people, and officially Beijing claimed that only 241 people had been killed.  Images of troops and military vehicles amassing in the border city of Shenzen have triggered fears of a similar-style crackdown among Hongkongers and international observers.  Despite this, Mr Cheung told the ABC that he and others were ""not scared"" of the PLA.  But he alleged that the former British colony had already lost a high degree of autonomy following a leaked recording of the territory's Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, saying that she would resign if she had a choice.  ""We can observe that the Chief Executive did not care about the Hong Kong citizen's voice and concerns,"" he said.  ""Only the Beijing Government is her master.""   Mr Cheung forms part of a group of students representing the Hong Kong Higher Institutions International Affairs Delegation (IAD) — a lobby group founded by the student unions of Hong Kong's universities.  He and others will meet with international students from Hong Kong studying at Melbourne universities this week.  Tensions between Hong Kong and mainland Chinese students on Australian campuses have spiked in the wake of the pro-democracy protests, resulting in heated confrontations at universities in Brisbane, Adelaide and Canberra. A pro-China poster with a death threat was also put on the ""Lennon Wall"" in the main foyer at the University of Technology Sydney.   Some protests in cities across Australia have become violent, with scuffles breaking out at a demonstration in Melbourne last month where a speaker was also pushed onto an ABC News cameraman. Mr Cheung told the ABC the student unions were concerned about the safety of Hongkonger international students in Australia following the incidents. ""We want to come here and give them support, and also to urge the Australian Government to try to use a more assertive attitude to protect our students here in Australia,"" he said.    He added that the Government should do more to ""protect the freedom of speech at campuses to avoid potential attacks"".  IAD has recently shifted its focus towards garnering international support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. ""In order to counter Chinese influence all over the world we should find allies with every free-world government,"" Mr Cheung said.  The group held an event in Hong Kong last month with more than 60,000 participants, urging more foreign governments to express support for the demonstrators. The ABC understands Mr Cheung and other IAD members will meet with some federal politicians in Canberra this week.   Mr Cheung said any move by China to quell the protests by force would have far-reaching ramifications, especially in Australia. ""We have more than 100,000 Australians in Hong Kong, and anything happening there can result in a big impact to the whole world,"" he said. The group intends to fly to more countries to lobby politicians, and Mr Cheung is planning to give a speech at the UK Parliament, and later in the US, as part of efforts to keep attention on Hong Kong.   The students will also be attending a seminar featuring artist Badiucao and the Canto-pop singer and pro-democracy activist Denise Ho, which will go ahead at the Melbourne City Conference Centre on Wednesday, after the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) last week said it could not host the event. The panel discussion is about the situation in Hong Kong and the city's future, and will also include author and academic Clive Hamilton, whose 2018 book Silent Invasion warned about growing Chinese Government influence in Australia.   The NGV said it ""was unable to accommodate the security and logistics required to book this event with short notice"", however Badiucao and Ho have suggested the decision was due to fear of reprisal from Beijing. The gallery is currently exhibiting several Terracotta Warriors on loan from China. It said it supported artists' rights to express a range of political viewpoints. ""I thought it was quite shocking,"" Ho told the ABC's The World program last week. ""That is a kind of self-censorship that is happening not only in Melbourne, not only in Hong Kong, but worldwide, where we see these different institutions and organisations … starting to keep a distance with all these protests from Hongkongers.""   The protests in Hong Kong were initially sparked by a proposed extradition bill that would have paved the way for Hongkongers to face trial in front of mainland Chinese courts, which critics say are not independent from the Government. While that bill has since been suspended, pro-democracy demonstrators are now calling for the resignation of Hong Kong's chief executive Carrie Lam and an investigation into the use of force by police during the protests among other objectives.

"Before I returned to my birthplace, Hong Kong, to pursue my legal career 18 years ago, I spent 15 years growing up in Melbourne, during which I was an Australian Labor Party supporter. Even after I left Australia and no longer voted in Australian elections, I continued to cheer on the ALP from afar. I have always been a mainstream progressive who subscribed to their message of social justice and human rights, but open to economic liberalisation. When it comes to standing up to authoritarians, the ALP has form.  John Curtin led the fight against fascists during World War II. Ben Chifley dealt firmly with Communist-infiltrated unions. Arthur Calwell spoke firmly against Communist movements. Bob Hawke sided with the US against the Soviets, and he also granted asylum to all Chinese students in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.   Kevin Rudd spoke of Australia as authoritarian China's ""zhengyou"", being a Chinese term for a true friend who is not afraid to express disagreements. With such history, if there were ever to be an archetype of people with whom Labor should firmly stand, the people of Hong Kong ought to be it. Millions of protesters in Hong Kong who have protested in recent months are fighting for the very essence of progressive values: freedom from being extradited to face trial at a non-independent judicial system, freedom from fear when exercising one's fundamental rights, the right to democratic governance. They have the courage to stand up to their authoritarian sovereign. On July 24, peaceful pro-Hong Kong protesters at the University of Queensland were attacked by a nationalistic Chinese Communist mob. The attack was later praised by China's consulate-general in Brisbane.   It prompted Australia's foreign minister Marise Payne to issue a stern statement against such Chinese interference and in defence of free speech. But the ALP was nowhere to be found.  Then came a similar but larger scale and more expletive-laden incident in Melbourne on August 16, during which an ABC cameraman was pushed over by a pro-Communist Chinese nationalist. Similar but smaller-scale incidents took place in other Australian cities in those few days.  What did Hongkongers get from the ALP in the aftermath of that weekend? Victorian Premier Dan Andrews, who signed up to China's Belt and Road initiative, has been conspicuously silent. As for federal Labor, Penny Wong (who I have long highly respected) made comments about the need for a calm and mature discussion about China. Sure, Australia's policy towards China needs to balance competing interests. But how hard can it be to speak up against Chinese nationalistic bullying against pro-Hong Kong voices on Australia's own shores? All this has left mainstream progressives like me in an unsatisfactory position of not being able to look to mainstream progressive support for Hong Kong in Australian politics.  The Liberal government has spoken out more than the ALP has in support of Hongkongers' rights within Hong Kong's ""One Country, Two Systems"" framework under China, but its tone is still circumspect compared with that of other Western nations.   And the most vociferous Australian political voices of support for Hong Kong and against expanding Chinese Communist Party (CCP) authoritarianism comes from the hard right of the Liberal Party. While they have been right to identify the issues at hand, their rhetoric unhelpfully harks back to that of the Cold War. But perhaps I should not be so surprised. Recent hearings at the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption are investigating the extent of relationships between the ALP and persons suspected of being close with the CCP.   More generally, the CCP has long sought to quell criticisms from progressives in the western world by accusing those who question its stance and actions as racists.  It would not surprise me if the ALP would be subject to accusations of discrimination against mainland Chinese students and migrants if it stood more firmly in relation to Hong Kong.  That said, as someone who is proud to be ethnically Chinese, I actually find it more racist for progressives to think that Chinese people are all in the mould of the CCP and that we are culturally disinterested in democracy and human rights. Further, with many US Democratic Party politicians, some British Labour politicians and some Canadian Liberal Party politicians now standing clearly with Hong Kong, the ALP risks becoming an outlier among English-speaking western progressive parties. Let me be clear. I am not reflexively against everything that the CCP does. Its record on economic reform in the past 40 years has been largely positive. Its success in leading the most number of people out of poverty in the shortest period of time in human history should be lauded. All I ask for is that politicians in democracies such as Australia not shirk from calling out the CCP when it acts contrary to universal values of democracy and human rights, including in relation to Hong Kong. And given their purported core values, mainstream progressive groups including Labor ought to be on the front lines in speaking up for the courageous people of Hong Kong, as well as for those who stand with Hongkongers on Australian shores.

57	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-02/hong-kong-protesters-want-more-radical-action/11469670	September 02, 2019	Hong Kong protesters are young and angry. Here's why many are ready for more radical action	"Three months on, there's still no end in sight for the Hong Kong protest movement.  What started as a demonstration against a bill to amend the city's extradition laws has now morphed into a broader movement challenging the legitimacy of the government and seeking fundamental political reforms. Every weekend, hundreds of thousands of protesters — sometimes more than a million — are still taking to the streets.  The protests draw Hongkongers from all walks of life: students, doctors, lawyers, journalists, teachers, civil servants, and, most recently, family members of police officers.  The discussions on internet forums and encrypted messaging apps remain vibrant, with innovative ideas for new protest actions emerging frequently. To better understand who the protesters are, as well as why and how they are protesting, I've conducted a series of large onsite surveys at 19 demonstrations since June 9, with the help of researchers from other universities.  We have so far surveyed more than 8,000 protesters with a response rate of over 85 per cent.   Our data show protesters tend to be young and highly educated. On average, half of our respondents are aged between 20 and 30. Around 77 per cent said they had a tertiary (higher) education. Few said they were unemployed, unlike protesters in other mass demonstrations around the world, like the Arab Spring uprisings and Spain's Indignados movement. Most respondents identified themselves as either democrats or localists.    However, in the early stages of the protests, it is also notable that nearly 30 per cent of respondents said that they were centrists or had no political affiliations. This dropped to around 15 per cent by early August. When asked why they were protesting, the vast majority of respondents (more than 90 per cent) cited two main motivations: the complete withdrawal of the controversial extradition bill and an independent inquiry into excessive use of force by police against the protesters. Interestingly, from July onwards, police violence has become a more pressing concern for respondents, with those who see it as ""very important"" rising from 85 per cent to over 95 per cent.  Protesters have also increasingly said they are fighting for Hong Kong's democracy, with those who see it as ""very important"" rising from 83 per cent to 88 per cent.   The resignation of Chief Executive Carrie Lam and other major officials was considered the least important reason for protesting.  This suggests that a change in leadership is not viewed as a solution to the political crisis — unlike in 2003, when half a million people marched against changes to Hong Kong's national security laws and demanded the resignation of then-leader CH Tung. Instead, the protesters are seeking a fundamental reform of the entire political system. For many of them, the extradition bill is just the surface of a rotting system.  It merely exposes the underlying problems that have been swept under the carpet for many years: the lack of democratic representation in the policy-making and legislative process, the declining accountability of the government, the blatant domination by a small clique of business and pro-Beijing elites, the increasing unimportance of public opinion, and the steady encroachment on people's political rights and civil liberties.   These same long-standing problems are what prompted the Umbrella Movement in 2014. But unlike the Umbrella protesters, who were intensely split over protest tactics, the current protest movement is exhibiting much stronger solidarity and resolution in achieving their demands. The majority of respondents see themselves as ""in the same boat"" (that is, sharing the same fate) with one another.  More 80 per cent believe the protests should go on if the government refuses to offer anything other than the suspension of the bill. Among them, more than half support escalating the protests.   This extraordinary level of solidarity is striking.  Part of this is because people have learnt from the mistakes of the Umbrella Movement. Instead of pointing fingers at each another, protesters are this time using the phrase ""do not split, do not sever our ties"" to deal with conflicts.  Misdeeds and transgressions are not condemned, but are now dealt with through collective reflection and friendly reminders. Fuelling protesters' solidarity is their strong feeling of desperation. Our survey results show the majority of respondents do not expect any concessions from the government.  This has remained steady from early on in the protests, and explains the emergence of slogans like ""I want to perish together"". We also found a high tolerance for the more radical and militant tactics of some of the younger protesters, even among those who consider themselves moderates. Consistently, over 80 per cent agree that peaceful assembly should combine with confrontational actions to maximize the impact of protests.  In June, slightly less than 70 per cent agreed that radical tactics were understandable when the government refuses to listen. That percentage rose to over 90 per cent in the August 4 protests. No-one knows what the ""endgame"" of the Hong Kong protests will be. The government is now hoping that mass arrests, coupled with the new start of the school year and the possible introduction of emergency regulations, may clear out the streets in the next few weeks, ideally before China's National Day celebrations on October 1.   The strategy may work, but likely only in the short run. If the Hong Kong government continues to refuse to heed what people are legitimately asking for, the people will undoubtedly return to the streets. As research from other social movement studies has taught us, protests take place in cycles. The current protest movement in Hong Kong may eventually quiet down after a while, but another one may be brewing on the horizon.

Police fired round after round of tear gas, with protesters taking cover behind umbrellas between the local headquarters of China's People's Liberation Army and the government. The water cannon unleashed blue-dyed water, which has been used elsewhere in the world to make it easier for police to identify protesters later. Riot police then marched on foot towards the neighbouring Admiralty district, where protesters had thrown fire bombs from overpasses, some landing close to police. There were unconfirmed reports that an off-duty policeman was wounded.   In the Wanchai bar and restaurant district, police fought running battles with protesters, beating them with truncheons; several protesters were arrested. The protests, which at one point blocked three key roads, came on the fifth anniversary of a decision by China to curtail democratic reforms and rule out universal suffrage in Hong Kong, a former British colony that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.   The latest clash came after the People's Liberation Army on Thursday rotated its troops in Hong Kong in what it said was a routine operation. Other protesters, many wearing black and face masks, marched in the Causeway Bay shopping district. The crowds grew after dusk in Wanchai, where demonstrators built roadblocks and banged iron sticks. Police on the platform of Prince Edward subway station swung batons at passengers who backed into one end of a train car behind umbrellas.  Video from broadcaster TVB also showed pepper spray being shot through an open door at a group seated on the floor while one man holds up his hands. It was not clear if all the passengers were protesters.    Police said they entered the station to arrest offenders after protesters assaulted others and damaged property inside.  The TVB video was widely shared on social media as another example of police brutality during the protests.  Angry crowds gathered outside Prince Edward and nearby Mongkok station, where police said they made arrests after protesters vandalised the customer service centre and damaged ticket machines.   The protests have gone on for three months, sometimes turning violent, and have targeted the airport, the legislature and the Liaison Office, the symbol of Chinese rule. Eric, a 22-year-old student, said telling people not to protest was like telling them not to breathe.  ""I feel it's my duty to fight for democracy. Maybe we win, maybe we lose, but we fight."" Police erected water-filled plastic barriers around key government buildings, and two water cannon, used briefly for the first time last weekend, were at the ready near the Liaison Office, still daubed with graffiti from an earlier protest.   Police arrested a number of prominent pro-democracy activists and three lawmakers on Friday, seeking to rein in a movement that began with anger over planned legislation allowing extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party.  It soon broadened into calls for democracy amid fears China is squeezing Hong Kong's freedoms. The Chinese government has rejected the protesters' claims and has instead warned of the damage to its economy. Beijing has also accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the demonstrations and warned against foreign interference. Hong Kong returned to China under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that allows it to keep freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, like the freedom to protest and an independent legal system.   There have been frequent clashes between protesters and police, who have often fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds, amid accusations of excessive force. With protesters and authorities locked in an impasse, and Hong Kong facing its first recession in a decade, speculation has grown that the city government may impose emergency laws, giving it extra powers over detentions, censorship and curfews. Politician Fernando Cheung said the arrests of the three legislators were probably aimed at causing more anger and chaos to justify the use of emergency laws.   Reuters"	ABC (Australia)
60	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-29/why-chinese-and-hong-kong-students-clash-in-australia/11457846	August 29, 2019	Why Chinese and Hong Kong students clash in Australia	The protests in Hong Kong have led to some open clashes here in Australia between students from mainland China and others from Hong Kong. There were angry scenes between pro-China and pro-Hong Kong groups in Sydney and Melbourne, as well as at universities in Brisbane and Adelaide. These clashes are troubling for the Australian university sector, which enrols 182,555 mainland Chinese and 11,822 Hongkongers as international students at various educational institutions. Our research suggests differences in the curriculum studied by mainland Chinese and Hong Kong students may help to explain the beliefs underpinning the protest movements. We held in-depth interviews with a random sample of more than a dozen international postgraduate students from mainland China who are studying, or very recently have been, at Western Australian universities. The interviews took place in late 2018 — before the recent Hong Kong protests.  We asked the participants about their experiences studying in Chinese schools where Moral Education is a compulsory subject.   The Moral Education curriculum teaches Chinese children to be politically proud of the Chinese Communist Party and loyal to the ideals of a One-China worldview.   Moral Education is a standalone subject and also embedded within other subjects, such as history and Chinese literacy studies. Moral Education starts being taught in the early years of schooling and continues throughout high school and during undergraduate university studies. In primary school, all Chinese children are supposed to join the Young Pioneers, a 130-million-strong youth organisation controlled by the Communist Party. In high school, teachers invite students who achieve highly, academically and morally, to join the Communist Youth League. In university, excellent students are invited to join the Communist Party. In contrast, Hong Kong students do not study Moral Education and cannot join the Young Pioneers, Youth League or the Communist Party.   The interviews suggest that when mainland Chinese students arrive in Western countries for postgraduate studies, they carry with them a moral duty to uphold their national identity. This identity is arguably constructed through the Moral Education lessons. The following are translated Mandarin quotes from participants in our study. Each quote comes from a different student, but we have de-identified them to protect their identity. They are talking about their experiences of studying Moral Education in their primary and high school years: I was taught to love our motherland and love our country. It's the right thing to do. We were taught many slogans that were inspirational, positive and patriotic. It taught us to love our country, our family and our society. In secondary school, Moral Education made us all feel we are part of one China and what the Government is doing is to give us a better life. We are also learning from our interviews that even after mainland Chinese students study in Western universities for several years, they are unlikely to change their previously learnt ideological positions. I think although the Communist Party is a one-party dictatorship, because in a big country like China it is very difficult to apply democracy and maintain the sustainability otherwise it will be too chaotic. When I was standing under the party flag and sworn in to join our Communist Party it was so exciting. After so many years of ideological and political education, I believe that the Communist Party is the most advanced organisation of our society. Now, especially when we are living overseas, if you hear the Chinese national anthem it brings me to tears of pride, belonging and identity. Another phenomenon our interviews revealed is that many of our participants expressed strong sympathy towards the Government. That holds even after they learn about facts and events that have been censored in China, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. I will most likely participate [in] rallies like welcoming President Xi's visit to Australia because I am … Chinese and I have a sense of belonging and responsibility attached to this Chinese identity. I also will be vocal about protecting China's sovereignty. China is a big country with a large population and there are still many people who are not well educated, therefore they are easy to be incited by others. Although the one party is never 100 per cent perfect, it at least proved itself that most people in China have a good life under its leadership.   Over the course of three interviews with each participant in our study, we discovered many Chinese international students felt isolated from Australian friendship circles. They expressed concern at the lack of opportunities to truly engage with Australian students during their time living here. Many worry that local Australian students just aren't interested in them. Actually I have little knowledge about how Australian society works — aside from the common social norms. I don't know where I can access such knowledge. Some locals take it for granted that we should have known this, but we really don't as we grew up in a totally different place. For me I tend to have the impression that the local students believe we Chinese students are not interested in talking to them, so they would not take the initiative and talk to us either. I suggest that our university can do more about it like organising activities so we could access local friendships. International education should be a two-way transaction, deep in its engagement and fluid in its ability to change as we change. But what these interviews show is the strong feelings many students from mainland China have about their country and government, which perhaps explains why they feel anger towards those who protest against that way of life. The growing trend of these Chinese graduates returning to their homeland for work opportunities also has a bearing on their continuing patriotism and sense of national identity.

When Hong Kong, a former British colony, and Macau, a former Portuguese colony, were handed back to China in 1997 and 1999 respectively, the territories were promised a high level of autonomy for 50 years under the ""one country, two systems"" constitutional principle. But increasingly, observers are pointing to the mass protests in Hong Kong over the now-shelved extradition deal with China as proof that the ""one country, two systems"" formula has failed in the city, dashing Beijing's hopes of unifying Taiwan with mainland China with the same offer.   While the protests have created divisions both in Hong Kong and overseas Chinese communities, Macau has remained largely unscathed by the political turmoil that has rocked the Asian financial hub just an hour's ferry ride away. Ho Iat Seng, the sole candidate running in today's Macau chief executive election, has also reportedly vowed to turn the former Portuguese colony into the poster child of the ""one country, two systems"" policy and set an example for Taiwan. As Hong Kong grapples with its 12th consecutive week of protests, we take a look at why Macau has often been seen as a success story for the ""one country, two systems"" framework and what it means for the future of the world's largest gambling hub.   Macau has generally been seen as the better-behaved special administrative region (SAR) under Chinese rule because of its largely conservative society, and as such, has remained at an arm's length from the protests in Hong Kong. But while the pro-democracy protests have so far not reached Macau's shores, some young people in Macau have reportedly travelled to Hong Kong to join the demonstrations there. Eilo Wing-yat Yu, an associate professor of government and public administration at the University of Macau, told the ABC a silent protest was proposed for August 19 at Macau's Senado Square but police disallowed it, and some pro-Beijing groups also came out and criticised the organisers for destabilising the society.   The Macau Daily Times cited the police as saying they refused authorisation ""in view of the recent clashes in Hong Kong, [where] some of the radical demonstrators have violated Hong Kong laws and seriously affected social order and the rule of law"". Political analyst Larry So Man-yum told the ABC that compared with the younger generation in Macau — who have more of ""an international perspective"" — many older and middle-aged Macanese people condemned the young protesters in Hong Kong. ""The older generation or the middle-aged generation appreciate the Government very much in the sense that the economy has been doing good,"" Mr So explained. He added that young people in Macau generally didn't have unemployment problems, although they still faced housing affordability issues like youth in Hong Kong. According to World Bank data, Macau has the fourth highest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in the world — at $US86,400 ($127,800) in 2018 — even higher than Switzerland ($US82,800), Qatar ($US69,000) and Hong Kong ($US49,000). However, Macau's population of just 623,000 is also just a fraction of Hong Kong's 7.4 million.   While both Macau and Hong Kong are governed under the ""one country, two systems"" formula, national security and Indo-Pacific expert at RAND corporation, Derek Grossman, said Macau was fundamentally different to Hong Kong because the nature of economic development was ""much more geared toward the gaming industry and less about interconnectivity with the Western economy"". He said the Portuguese were also more ""forward-leaning"" in integrating Communist Party of China elements into Macau's governance ahead of the handover in 1999.   According to political scientist Bill Chou Kwok-ping, Beijing's successful penetration into Macau dated back to the ""12-3 riots"" in Macau on December 3, 1966, after which the Portuguese colonial administration had to yield to the pressure of the pro-Beijing activists who were inspired by the Cultural Revolution. ""On the contrary, [Hong Kong's] pro-Beijing activists were defeated in 1967 and marginalised soon afterwards,"" said Dr Chou, from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""Without strong presence in [Hong Kong] … the pro-Beijing social forces still have to fight headwind in order to win the hearts and votes of [Hong Kong] people.""   In another win over hearts and minds, Chinese intervention is also believed to be behind the end to the triad wars ahead of Macau's handover to China. Dr Yu said Chinese authorities intervened during the transitional period, when Macau was in chaos and suffered economic recession because of the fight between gangsters over their interests in casinos. ""Month[s] before the handover, the Chinese authorities intervened, stopped gangster fight[ing], and restored social stability,"" he said. ""Therefore, Macau society has a relatively strong pro-Beijing sentiment that is conducive to Beijing-Macau harmony."" Dr Chou added that ideology and identity also mattered — nearly half of the population in Macau were born in mainland China compared to just over 20 per cent in Hong Kong. ""Macau people are far less proud of their identity than their HK counterparts,"" he said. ""Therefore, Macau people often turn to mainland China for identification, inspirations, and solutions to their own problems."" And while Hong Kong in 2003 expressed strong opposition to a national security law known as Article 23 — which prohibited ""treason, secession, sedition"" against the Central Government — the same law was passed in Macau.   Despite Ho Iat Seng's promise to turn Macau into a poster child for Beijing's ""one country, two systems"" model, observers are divided over whether Macau is really a success story for the policy. Mr Grossman said Macau is the ""lone success story"" for the ""one country, two systems"" framework, as for the most part there has been little tangible resistance to the framework.   However there has been some evidence of dissent to the formula, he said, especially prevalent during Hong Kong's Umbrella Movement protests in 2014. ""For example, academics then warned of rising censorship resulting from Macau's incorporation into the framework,"" Mr Grossman said. ""And police in 2014 shut down an attempt by pro-democracy activists to push forward a national referendum on the re-election of Chief Executive Fernando Chui Sai-on, who was running unopposed for his second term."" Mr Grossman said one reason why Macau accepted the framework more than Hong Kong could be that people prioritised the economic development China could bring to Macau rather than the maintenance of their civil liberties.   Dr Chou, on the other hand, didn't believe Macau was a successful case study for the ""one country, two systems"" principle because the apparent stability was in fact due to Beijing's tighter control on various aspects of Macau. He said nearly half of students up to high school attended pro-Beijing schools, therefore ""the pro-China ideology has more opportunities to be spread to young people"". ""Outspoken intellectuals and journalists are sacked, bullied, or sidelined; the mass media are far from independent from the establishment,"" he added.   Dr Chou, a former associate professor at the University of Macau, was himself denied a renewal of his contract in 2014, allegedly in retaliation for his political activism — he was a vocal proponent of increased democratisation in Macau. The New York Times reported at the time that Dr Chou was not told why his contract was not renewed, but in the previous month he was elected vice-president of the New Macau Association, one of the territory's pro-democracy organisations. In a written statement to the Times, the university denied Mr Chou's dismissal was connected to his activism, saying ""these actions and decisions were in line with the relevant regulations and procedures and had nothing to do with Prof. Chou's political activities, speeches, or views in the community"".   Ho Iat Seng, who resigned from China's top legislative body — the National People's Congress Standing Committee — earlier this year, received a total of 378 nominations from the 400-member electoral committee to support his bid for Macau's top job. As candidates need at least 66 nominations — and electoral committee members are not allowed to nominate more than one candidate — Mr Ho became the sole candidate for the election on August 25. Mr Ho, 62, will need a simple majority — or at least 200 votes — to lead Macau for at least the next five years.   Observers largely agree Macau would become more aligned with mainland China under Mr Ho's incoming administration — some of his priorities include integrating Macau with the rest of the Greater Bay Area and bolstering patriotism among local youth. At a press conference following a meeting with members of the city's electoral committee, Mr Ho was also quoted by South China Morning Post as saying: ""[Macau] should show to Taiwan the success of one country, two systems … and show its advantages."" Amid fears over Beijing's creeping encroachment on freedoms of the SARs, Mr Ho pledged to ""legally safeguard press freedom"" as well as to protect freedoms in ""publishing and expression"". London-based Jason Chao, who used to lead the pro-democracy group  New Macau Association, told the ABC Mr Ho was ""extremely familiar with the political line of the Chinese Government"". ""I believe that he will keep Macau firmly in line with the Chinese Government's political agenda after he takes office,"" he said. ""Under the Chinese policy, Ho definitely has a role to play in promoting the 'one country, two systems' idea to Taiwan. ""Ho will play along of course. But we all know that the Macau example is not convincing in the eyes of Taiwanese people.""

Demonstrators, including families with young children and older citizens, linked hands across different districts as others held up banners thanking overseas nations for supporting ""freedom and democracy"" in Hong Kong. Their move echoed the one on August 23, 1989, when an estimated 2 million people joined arms across the three Baltic states in a protest against Soviet rule that became known as the Baltic Way or Baltic Chain.   ""I joined the Hong Kong Way because it's peaceful,"" protester Peter Cheung, 27, said. ""This is the 30th anniversary of the Baltic Way. I hope there will be a bigger chance to make an international noise."" The protest, which included dozens shining lights from the top of Kowloon's Lion Rock, visible from the main island of Hong Kong, showed the apparent defiance of Hong Kong people after warnings from Communist Party leaders in Beijing and Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam about violence. Police presence was thin and the protest ended promptly at 9:00pm, Hong Kong time.   But protesters are also planning a ""stress test"" of the airport this weekend and some were making their way from the nearby suburban town of Tung Chung on Friday night. Hong Kong's High Court on Friday said it was extending an order requiring public demonstrations to have the permission of authorities, with an aim to ban ""those who want to deliberately obstruct or interfere with the normal use of the airport"". So in response, activists plan to disrupt transport to the international airport by all heading there at the same time this weekend. ""Go to the airport by different means, including MTR, airport bus, taxi, bike and private car to increase pressure on airport transport,"" protest organisers wrote online on Friday. The protests, triggered by a now-suspended bill that would have allowed extraditions to China, have plunged the former British colony into its worst crisis since its return to China in 1997 and pose a major challenge for Beijing.   The unrest has widened into calls for greater freedom, fuelled by worries about the erosion of rights guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" formula, adopted after the 1997 handover, such as an independent judiciary and the right to protest. The airport, reached by a gleaming suspension bridge carrying both rail and road traffic, was forced to close last week when protesters, barricading passageways with luggage trolleys, metal barriers and other objects, clashed with police. China's Hong Kong affairs office condemned the mayhem as ""near-terrorist acts"". Some activists apologised for last week's airport turmoil, which resulted in more than 200 flights being cancelled.   The Canadian consulate said it had suspended travel to mainland China for local staff, just days after a Chinese employee of the city's British consulate was confirmed to have been detained in China. Simon Cheng Man-kit was released on Saturday as scheduled after 15 days of administrative detention, according to public security authorities in Shenzen.   The Luohu public security bureau in Shenzhen, the mainland city neighbouring Hong Kong, made the announcement on its Weibo microblog account. Mr Cheng was detained for violating mainland Chinese law and ""confessed to his illegal acts,"" the statement said, without providing further details. ""Simon is released. Simon is safe,"" said Max Chung, organiser of a rally earlier this week to urge the British Government to step up efforts to free Mr Cheng. Canada's latest travel advisory on Thursday warned of reports of increased screening of travellers' digital devices at border crossings between mainland China and Hong Kong. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Canada's decision not to allow local staff to visit the mainland was one for Canada, which it respected. If people came to China and followed the law, they would have no problems, he said. ""But if you have a hidden aim, and are hatching a sinister plot, then I fear in China you need to be in a state of apprehension and extra careful."" The Foreign Correspondents Club of China said it had received multiple reports of Chinese border officials detaining journalists and searching their digital devices when travelling between the mainland and Hong Kong. The protests are taking a toll on Hong Kong's economy and tourism, with the special administrative region on the cusp of its first recession in a decade. Transport Secretary Frank Chan said airport passenger volume from August 1 to 21 was down 11 per cent from the same period last year, with cargo volume down 14 per cent.   Commerce Secretary Edward Yau said visitor arrivals started to fall in mid-July. Between August 15 and 20, arrivals were down 49.6 per cent on the corresponding 2018 period. ""It was the fastest and steepest drop in recent years, and the situation is obviously very worrisome,"" he told reporters. The protests have led to corporate casualties, most dramatically at the Cathay Pacific airline, amid mounting Chinese scrutiny of the involvement of some of its staff in protests.   Cathay confirmed on Friday that Rebecca Sy, the head of Cathay Dragon's Airlines Flight Attendants' Association, was no longer with the company.  Her departure follows the shock resignation of Cathay chief executive Rupert Hogg last week. Demonstrators have five demands: withdraw the extradition bill, set up an independent inquiry into the protests and perceived police brutality, stop describing the protests as ""rioting"", waive charges against those arrested and resume political reform. Beijing has sent a clear warning that forceful intervention is possible, with paramilitary forces holding drills just over the border.   Reuters/AP"	ABC (Australia)

The city's High Court on Friday said it was extending an order requiring public demonstrations to have the permission of authorities, with an aim to ban ""those who want to deliberately obstruct or interfere with the normal use of the airport"". So in response, activists plan to disrupt transport to the international airport this weekend by all heading there at the same time.   ""Go to the airport by different means, including MTR, Airport Bus, Taxi, Bike and Private Car to increase pressure on airport transport,"" protest organisers wrote online. Hong Kong's airport, one of the world's busiest, was forced to close temporarily last week and hundreds of flights were cancelled or rescheduled when protesters and police clashed. The airport authority published a half-page advertisement in major newspapers on Friday urging young people to ""love Hong Kong"" and said it opposed acts that ""blocked and interfered with the operation of the airport"". It said it would continue to work to maintain smooth operations. Meanwhile, the Canadian Consulate in Hong Kong said it had suspended travel to mainland China for local staff, just days after an employee of the city's British Consulate was confirmed to have been detained in China. China's foreign ministry confirmed on Wednesday that Simon Cheng, an employee of the British mission, had been detained in the border city of Shenzhen, neighbouring Hong Kong. Beijing has accused Britain and other Western countries of meddling in its affairs in Hong Kong. Canada's latest travel advisory on Thursday warned that increased screening of travellers' digital devices had been reported at border crossings between mainland China and Hong Kong. Multiple protests are planned for Hong Kong on Friday, including a march by accountants to government headquarters and a ""Baltic Chain"" event where protesters will join hands across different districts in the Chinese territory.  In 1989, an estimated 2 million people joined arms across three Baltic states in a protest against Soviet rule that became known as the Baltic Way or Baltic Chain.   ""The Baltic Way brought the world's attention to their cause and inspired following generations,"" the rally organisers said in a statement.  ""We plead that you will not look away at this crucial time. Stand with Hong Kong."" The protests, originally over a now-suspended extradition bill to mainland China, have plunged Hong Kong into its deepest crisis since its British handover to Beijing in 1997 and pose a major challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Google announced on Thursday its YouTube streaming video service had disabled 210 channels appearing to engage in a coordinated influence operation around the Hong Kong protests.  Twitter and Facebook have also dismantled a similar campaign originating in mainland China.   The unrest, initially triggered by a since-suspended extradition bill, has broadened into a wider existential debate about Hong Kong's future under Beijing's rule. Following Britain's handover of the colony to China in 1997, Hong Kong was to receive British-style capitalism, freedoms, and the common law system for a period of 50 years known as the ""one country, two systems"" principle.  These terms were set out in a document known as the Sino-British joint declaration of 1984, but by 2017, China said the document was not binding and had ""no longer had any practical significance"".     Nearly three months of anti-government rallies have plunged the city into crisis.   It has brought a diversity of residents out in protest, which has included staff from the city's air carrier, Cathay Pacific, whom China has sought to identify. Cathay confirmed on Friday that Rebecca Sy, the head of Cathay Dragon's Airlines Flight Attendants' Association, was no longer with the company.  Her departure follows the shock resignation of Cathay CEO Rupert Hogg last week. The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions said it would hold a news conference later on Friday to provide details of Ms Sy's departure. The protests are already taking a toll on the city's economy and tourism, with the special administrative region on the cusp of its first recession in a decade. Corporations, including big banks and property developers, have called for a restoration of law and order, while exhibitors are seeing widespread cancellations of events. In the most recent case, international jewellers have sought the rescheduling of a huge trade fair with up to 40 per cent of exhibitors threatening to pull out. Demonstrators have five demands: withdraw the extradition bill, establish an independent inquiry into the protests and perceived police brutality, stop describing the protests as ""rioting"", waive charges against those arrested and resume political reform. Beijing has sent a clear warning that forceful intervention is possible, with paramilitary forces holding drills in Shenzhen, which sits on mainland China's border with Hong Kong.

The statement came amid reports that Twitter and Facebook have dismantled more than 200,000 accounts they believe were part of a Chinese Government influence campaign trying to undermine the protests in Hong Kong.   ""It is totally understandable and reasonable for Chinese students and other Chinese citizens overseas to express indignation and opposition against such words and deeds that attempt to separate China and smear its image,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said. ""We also hope overseas Chinese can express their patriotism in a rational way and protect themselves from harm. ""The Chinese Government asks overseas Chinese to observe local laws and regulations. In the meantime, we hope relevant countries can understand and respect their legal activities and protect their lawful rights and interests."" Over the last few weeks, hundreds of thousands of pro-China protesters have shown up at tense pro-Hong Kong rallies around the world, from Manila to New York, Toronto and Paris. About 600 people from rival groups took part in a heated rally outside the State Library of Victoria in Melbourne on Friday, but tensions boiled over and several scuffles broke out, forcing police to separate the protesters.   On the same weekend in Adelaide, up to 80 pro-Hong Kong protesters congregated at the University of South Australia's city campus but were soon surrounded by more than 100 pro-Chinese demonstrators, many of them hurling derogatory and sexist insults such as ""traitor"" and ""f***ing coward"" at the leaders of the pro-democracy movement. A flood of more than 1,000 pro-Beijing activists peacefully marched through Sydney on Saturday, chanting ""one China, no separation"".   Mr Geng's comments come after the nation's ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, warned foreigners not to support the pro-democracy protesters on Saturday, denouncing the Hong Kong protesters' actions as ""radical, violent and illegal"". ""Their behaviours have grossly trampled on the rule of law and social order in Hong Kong, seriously threatened the local residents' life and safety, severely jeopardised Hong Kong's prosperity and stability,"" he said. He added that the unfolding situation was ""solely the internal affairs of China"" and warned foreign governments, including Australia's, to not support Hong Kong's protesters or interfere. ""Any attempt to mess up Hong Kong is doomed to fail."" After Canada and the European Union issues a joint statement in defence of the 'fundamental right of assembly' in Hong Kong, China's embassy in Ottawa lashed out at Canada, warning it to ""immediately stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs,"" according to the South China Morning Post. Meanwhile, Twitter and Facebook said they had dismantled more than 200,000 accounts they believed were part of a Chinese Government influence campaign trying to undermine the protests in Hong Kong.   Twitter said it suspended 936 accounts and the operations appeared to be a coordinated state-backed effort originating in China. ""Specifically, we identified large clusters of accounts behaving in a coordinated manner to amplify messages related to the Hong Kong protests,"" the statement said. It added these accounts were just the most active portions of this campaign and that a ""larger, spammy network"" of approximately 200,000 accounts had been proactively suspended before they were substantially active. Facebook said it had removed accounts and pages from a small network after a tip from Twitter and that its investigation found links to individuals associated with the Chinese Government.   The Hong Kong protests, which have presented one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012, began in June as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts, but have since swelled into wider calls for democracy and against police brutality.   Following weeks of increasingly violent demonstrations in the Asian financial hub and multiple closures of its international airport, up to 1.7 million anti-government protesters of all ages rallied peacefully in Hong Kong in torrential rain in one of the biggest protests the movement has seen since the initial June 16 march. When Mr Geng was asked whether China would resort to violence to quell protests, he replied that ""Hong Kong affairs are purely China's domestic affairs"".   He also referred to statements made in an August 7 seminar held in Shenzhen, when Zhang Xiaoming, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council said China would not sit by if the situation deteriorated. Mr Zhang said China had sufficient capabilities to quickly subdue possible unrest. Members of China's paramilitary People's Armed Police forces have been seen training across the border in Shenzhen, including on Sunday morning, fuelling speculation they could be sent in to suppress the protests. The Hong Kong police, however, have said they are capable of handling the situation. In a press conference this morning, Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam said she would be setting up a ""communication platform"" to resolve differences in the city as well as a fact-finding study to look into the causes of the protests and the police response to them. But the chief executive's comments fell short of the protesters' demands, including for her resignation and an independent inquiry into what they describe as police brutality.

A pair of cartoons written in Chinese were found on a ""Lennon Wall"" near the University of Technology Sydney's (UTS) main entrance and were removed only after the ABC brought them to the attention of campus security. One cartoon on the UTS wall showed a man holding another man over a cliff with the caption: ""Take back your Hong Kong independence speech if you don't want to die"". Lennon Walls were popularised by pro-democracy activists during the Hong Kong Umbrella Movement in 2014 and are often the site of thousands of colourful post-it notes and posters calling for peace and unity. Another shows a figure getting slapped and read ""this slap is for the CPC Committee"". The Central Committee is a political body comprising of China's top leaders, including President Xi Jinping.   The offensive materials were brought to the ABC's attention by a source inside UTS who wished to remain anonymous. ""My concern is that a small number of students are getting themselves so wound up with their nationalism that may be crossing the line and doing things which are illegal in Australia,"" they said.  ""Some may not be aware of what they are doing, maybe some are aware but don't care."" The university earlier this month installed security guards after it created a dedicated space for the Lennon Wall — officially re-branding a ""poster wall"" — when materials belonging to pro-democracy and pro-One China activists around campus were found vandalised. The university said it has so far been impressed with the ""respectful behaviour"" but had removed several inappropriate materials. ""A small number of posts not complying with the published rules have been removed, such as those over the size limits, or found to include offensive or hateful speech,"" a UTS spokesperson said. Pro-Beijing protest organisers claimed their posts on some Lennon walls had been torn down across university campuses, which they regarded as a deprivation of their freedom of speech. On Saturday, Sydney had its first major pro-Beijing protests under the theme ""Stop Riots in Hong Kong"".   Jack Liang, who has been living in Australia for 20 years and is originally from Guangzhou in China, was one of the organisers of Saturday's demonstration. ""My normal life has been affected by the pro-Hong Kong protests in Hong Kong and Australia,"" he said. ""I felt deeply offended and discriminated because of the recent pro-Hong Kong protests."" He said the term ""Chinas"", a term widely viewed as a discriminatory language against people who come from mainland China, was being increasingly used in Australia. Mr Liang claimed hackers had taken control of his website which he was using to collect and organise personal information about pro-One China protesters. He said he did not believe that information, which included phone numbers and email addresses, was compromised but for several days he was unable to access the site's control panel ahead of the rally.   Paranoia and feelings of ""discrimination"" have intensified in Australia as the political unrest in Hong Kong continued to escalate, particularly at university campuses. Speaking Cantonese or Mandarin or using simplified Chinese has also become a point of contention on both sides. One pro-Hong Kong organiser was upset and refused to be interviewed when she was approached by the ABC with a text message in simplified Chinese.

An estimated 600 people from rival pro-Hong Kong democracy and pro-China groups took part in demonstrations outside the State Library of Victoria in Melbourne. Several scuffles broke out, forcing police to separate the groups. Footage of Friday night's protests quickly spread on Chinese state media, where reports were favourable of the pro-China protesters who they said surrounded the pro-democracy demonstrators.   ""Melbourne's Chinese students and Chinese immigrants spontaneously came and hung the national flag, supported the motherland and surrounded the pro HK independence people,"" one report said.  ""In order to prevent the national flag from getting wet, the patriots held umbrellas for the national flag in the rain. There are Chinese flag guards everywhere. Good job!"" At the time of publication, the post had been ""liked"" more than 1.1 million times and shared almost 100,000 times.   China's ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, issued a statement on Saturday morning, as further rallies were taking place in Sydney and Melbourne.  He denounced the Hong Kong protesters' actions as ""radical, violent and illegal"" and said they were determined to undermine its ""one country, two systems"" arrangement. ""Their behaviours have grossly trampled on the rule of law and social order in Hong Kong, seriously threatened the local residents' life and safety, severely jeopardised Hong Kong's prosperity and stability,"" he said.  No responsible government would sit idly by."" He added that the unfolding situation was ""solely the internal affairs of China"" and warned foreign governments, including Australia's, to not support Hong Kong's protesters or interfere. ""We sincerely hope that people from all walks of life in Australia will see the real picture of situation in Hong Kong, act in the interests of Hong Kong's prosperity, stability and rule of law,"" he said. ""Any attempt to mess up Hong Kong is doomed to fail.""   The rallies continued on Saturday, with more than 1,000 pro-Beijing activists peacefully marching through Sydney's CBD to rally against the Hong Kong protests. The pro-mainland supporters gathered at about noon at Belmore Park, near Central Station. One pro-Hong Kong demonstrator who turned up was escorted away by police. Demonstrators with flags and banners in English and Mandarin were chanting ""one China, no separation"" and ""one country, two systems"". Police escorted the demonstrators up George Street and onto Town Hall where speeches and singing continued.   In Melbourne, pro-democracy demonstrators were joined by more than 100 members of Melbourne's Uyghur, Tibetan and Vietnamese communities, among others, who came to show their concern about the situation in Hong Kong. Organiser Phong Nguyen said he hoped Melburnians would be ""appalled"" by the behaviour of pro-China protesters who clashed with the pro-Hong Kong democracy activists on Friday night. ""We [are] very concerned about what China's threatening lately, about the crackdown,"" he said. ""We [have] still got a very vivid memory of the Tiananmen Square. We don't want another Tiananmen Square."" Vietnamese community leader Bon Nguyen said many of the people joining the protest were ""victims of the communist regime"".   ""We come together strongly to show our support, to protect our Australian democratic values. It is our responsibility to do that,"" he said. ""The moment we keep silent, we are actually concurring to the actions of the aggressive regime."" ABC"	ABC (Australia)

Augustus Tang, the head of Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company — which, like Cathay, is managed by Swire Pacific Ltd — will take over as the carrier's new chief. The airline also said Paul Loo had resigned as chief customer and commercial officer, to be replaced by Ronald Lam, head of the carrier's low-cost arm Hong Kong Express. Cathay Chairman John Slosar said recent events had called into question the airline's commitment to flight safety and security, and put its reputation and brand under pressure. ""This is regrettable as we have always made safety and security our highest priority,"" he said in a statement.  ""We therefore think it is time to put a new management team in place who can reset confidence and lead the airline to new heights."" Mr Hogg said these had been ""challenging weeks"" and it was right for he and Mr Loo to take responsibility as leaders. Mr Hogg's resignation was first announced by Chinese state television, CCTV. It was unclear, however, if it would help revive the company's reputation on the mainland. ""The roots are rotten. It doesn't make a difference no matter who's leading the company,"" a Chinese social media user said on the social media platform, Weibo, in a post liked more than 900 times.   Cathay, which has been under pressure from the Chinese aviation regulator, said it was fully committed to Hong Kong under the principle of ""one country, two systems"" and was confident Hong Kong would have a great future. The airline, which is 30 per cent owned by Air China, became caught in crosswinds between Beijing and pro-democracy groups in the Asian financial hub after some of its employees took part in the Hong Kong protests. This week, Cathay terminated the employment of two pilots over their involvement in the protests, after being ordered by China's aviation regulator to suspend personnel who had engaged in illegal protests. On Monday aviation workers joined a strike that gridlocked Hong Kong, forcing airlines, including Cathay, to cancel hundreds of flights. Responding to a question on the protests at a press conference earlier this week, Cathay chairman John Slosar said the company respected its staff's opinions. ""We certainly wouldn't dream of telling them what they have to think about something. They're all adults, they're all service professionals. We respect them greatly,"" he said. Chinese state-owned media outlet Global Times ran news stories this week highlighting Cathay employees' participation in the ongoing protests, stating that its ""fence-sitting approach"" could ""taint its image"". Cathay last week reported its first profit for the six months to June since 2016 and said the second half was likely to be better despite a lower forward bookings due to local unrest. An analyst said Mr Hogg is been highly regarded within the industry, having led a nearly completed three-year financial turnaround plan and the recent acquisition of HK Express. ""It is disappointing to learn of his resignation particularly given this current challenging period,"" said the analyst, who was not authorised to speak publicly about personnel changes.

71	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-16/how-mainland-chinese-feel-about-the-hong-kong-protests/11420840	August 16, 2019	China's greatest weapon against Hong Kong's protests may be nationalist rage — and Jackie Chan	"Just a few hundred metres from the Shenzhen Bay sports complex where thousands of paramilitary police and their trucks are gathered, tourists and locals are enjoying a late afternoon stroll along the bay.  Few seem aware of the display of force that China's Government has mustered inside the tightly secured stadium nearby. But everyone we spoke to was well aware of the unrest that has gripped the city just a few kilometres away across the water.  ""I read news about Hong Kong and I think they are really out of control. The young people stopped working to protest,"" said a woman in her twenties named Wang, who declined to give her full name.    Initially when the protests began with up to 2 million people marching to oppose an extradition deal with mainland China, Beijing's army of censors tried to scrub any mention of it from the country's internet.  But with word spreading, China's Government abruptly changed tack.  Instead, they have made Hong Kong headline news, launching a full-blown propaganda campaign to paint the protesters as ""violent criminals"", ""thugs"" and even suggesting some were ""terrorists"". The weekly violent clashes with police have been framed by Beijing as totally the fault of the ""radical"" protesters.  On the global internet beyond China's censorship, a fierce information war has erupted between pro and anti-China groups, with short, highly edited clips from both sides the main tool of combat.   ""They're appealing to the Americans for democracy, right?"" said a university student sipping bubble milk tea at Shenzhen Bay foreshore surnamed Zhang. ""I think foreign parties have encouraged the unrest and escalated it,"" he said.  ""Many Hong Kong young people are abusing democracy to selfishly destroy the relationship between China and Hong Kong,"" he said.    In recent days, the state-directed campaign to control the narrative went into overdrive when a group of protesters at Hong Kong's International Airport mobbed two men, tied them up and humiliated them while stranded travellers watched on. One of the victims, a reporter for the Communist Party's jingoistic Global Times, was found to have a pro-police T-shirt on him, fuelling accusations from the protesters that he was an informant trying to infiltrate the group.  But the images of young masked vigilantes shining torches in his eyes and parading him on a baggage trolley to the world's media has caused genuine anger on the mainland.  ""He got beaten just because he supported the Hong Kong police. This is very different from what they claim to say about democracy and freedom. It's ridiculous,"" said another university student surnamed Qiu, who also didn't want to give his full name.    Many mainlanders feel Hong Kongers are privileged and have long looked down on them as the poorer, oppressed cousins who lack the global affluence of the former British colony — a perception that is being reinforced by the protests.  ""As mainlanders, we might be discriminated against in Hong Kong,"" said Qiu.  ""I think Hong Kong is part of China, we're one family. We don't want to hear 'f*** off', we want to be treated fairly,"" he said.  In recent weeks the Chinese state media has also drummed up campaigns around the nation's flag, after protesters cut one down and threw it in Hong Kong harbour — an act that would incur jail time on the mainland. Among the prominent celebrities joining an online campaign to ""guard"" the flag is Hong Kong-born Jackie Chan, who this week appeared on state television to express his patriotism and respect for it.    Foreign interference is also a central theme of Beijing's efforts to frame the protest movement, claiming ""black hands"" of the CIA are stirring up the unrest.  Foreign media raises suspicions too.  Within minutes of starting interviews at the Shenzhen Bay foreshore to gauge local sentiment towards Hong Kong, a young visiting couple from Beijing declined to speak with the ABC, claiming we're out to ""smear China"". They then promptly went to two patrolling members of the military police to report us, and walked away.  The pair of camouflage-clad officers filmed and followed us until we left. "	ABC (Australia)

By 12:00pm (AEST), the benchmark ASX 200 index had slipped by 0.1 per cent to 6,402 points. The broader All Ordinaries index was trading flat at 6,485. It comes as Wall Street made a partial recovery overnight, amid falling bond yields and simmering US-China trade tensions. The Australian dollar was buying 67.75 US cents, holding onto gains from stronger-than-expected jobs numbers yesterday.   Shares in Ooh!Media plunged 42 per cent in early trade after the advertising company reported a massive earnings downgrade. Its stock has since settled 24.5 per cent lower. The company has warned shareholders to expect a ""sharp decline"" (-18pc) in earnings to a range between $125-$135 million.   Ooh!Media has blamed it on a ""significant decline in overall media advertising spend"" by its clients and ""challenging market conditions experienced by the wider media market"". On the flipside, Star Entertainment Group is one of the best performing stocks, having surged 7.9 per cent. That was despite the casino operator's underlying full-year profit dropping 8.4 per cent to $223.7 million due to weaker spending by overseas visitors, mainly from China. Star also reported a 30.7 per cent drop in revenue for its VIP business for the year. However, Star's domestic business had a solid performance, with its Sydney, Brisbane and Gold Coast casino earnings up 5.4 per cent. Domain's share price jumped 4.2 per cent — having rebounded from a 2.1 per cent drop in early trade. That was despite the real estate classifieds company reporting a full-year loss of $137.6 million. Its hefty loss was driven by a $178.8 million goodwill impairment due to a drop in listings across the Sydney and Melbourne property markets — which Domain previously flagged to the market in February. Even if those significant one-off costs are excluded, Domain's underlying profit was still a 29.3 per cent slump to $37.4 million. Investors nevertheless chose to focus on the positive message in Domain's cloudy outlook. In particular, the company said it saw ""encouraging signs of buyer activity"" in the first few weeks of the current financial year, including ""increased attendance at open for inspections and increased home loan application volumes"". But it also warned of listing volumes remaining weak, with national market listings down 20 per cent in July. The Dow Jones index closed 100 points higher (+0.4pc) at 25,579, an improvement over the previous day's 800-point plunge. Amid a volatile session, which saw wild swings for the main US indices, the benchmark S&P 500 index added 0.25 per cent.   But the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped by 0.1 per cent. However, trading was more downbeat in Europe, with London's FTSE falling by 1.1 per cent. The broader US market was lifted by stronger-than-expected retail figures, up 0.7 per cent in July, allaying fears about waning consumer demand. ""Consumer strength has a lot to do with the low unemployment rate and historically low interest rates,"" said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group. ""Money is cheap and people are working."" Wall Street also received a boost from Walmart — its share price jumped 6.1 per cent after the supermarket giant reported quarterly results which beat market expectations. The strong retail news helped offset simmering US-China trade tensions. On Thursday, Beijing vowed it would counter the last round of tariffs on Chinese imports and called on the United States to meet it halfway, while US President Donald Trump said in an interview any deal must be made ""on our terms"". The prolonged escalation of the trade war between the world's two largest economies and its economic fallout have weighed on global markets for more than a year, with no end in sight. China has ""a long history of looking at things in terms of decades, not election cycles,"" Mr Keator added. ""I'm not surprised that China's playing the long game."" Thursday's worldwide market sell-off was triggered by the uncertainty around the ongoing US-China trade war, intensifying Hong Kong protests, further evidence of China's rapidly cooling economy and US bond markets signalling a potential recession. It led to investors piling into safe-haven assets amid fears of an impending global economic slowdown. ""Let's not rush in and sell everything — there is opportunity in a downturn,"" Rabobank's head of Asia-Pacific markets research Michael Every told The Business, before adding that the German, US and Chinese economies were all looking vulnerable. ""Our house view is yes, there will be a US recession next year, that's pretty much baked into the cake.""   With investors still remaining cautious, the interest rate on America's 10-year treasury bonds briefly fell below 1.5 per cent, its lowest level in three years. Meanwhile, the rate on US 30-year bonds dropped to a record low, below 2 per cent. ""I don't think we have seen a bottom in yields yet,"" said Gary Pzegeo, head of fixed income at CIBC Private Wealth Management. ""We'll likely have a reaction from the Federal Reserve at the next meeting. ""That could be something that fuels further moves lower in parts of the yield curve depending on how aggressive a stance they take."" Spot gold is trading around a six-year high of $US1,523 an ounce, which has led to Australian gold miners dominating the list of best-performing stocks in recent weeks. Brent crude has fallen sharply (-2pc) to $US58.30 US dollars per barrel due to concerns about waning demand for oil amid a global slowdown. ABC/Reuters

74	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-16/pro-china-protest-delayed-over-fake-melbourne-council-permit/11416848	August 16, 2019	Pro-China rally in Melbourne condemning Hong Kong protests delayed over fake council permit	"A pro-China rally planned for Saturday in Melbourne to condemn the clashes in Hong Kong has been postponed after a letter claiming to be an event permit from the Melbourne City Council was confirmed to be fake.   A well-known local Chinese media outlet, Australian Red Scarf, first announced the pro-Beijing protests in Melbourne on their WeChat account last Friday, accompanied by an image of a letter saying the council approved the ""Support One China Principle"" event to be held at the State Library in Melbourne. About 100 people were expected to gather in front of the State Library in the morning, and countered by a collective of pro-democracy groups including Hong Kong, Uyghur and Tibet activists.   Pro-Hong Kong and pro-China rallies are also planned at the Martin Place Amphitheatre and Belmore Park in Sydney on Friday and Saturday respectively. The protests come after student demonstrations between the pro-Hong Kong and pro-Beijing camps have seen confrontations over the past fortnight, ranging from scuffles at the University of Queensland (UQ) to peaceful hours-long debates on the footpaths outside Monash University's Clayton campus in Melbourne. On Wednesday, the ABC approached the Melbourne City Council about the letter — which claimed the council approved the pro-China rally — who then issued a statement on Twitter announcing that the letter was ""fake"". ""The City of Melbourne does not issue permits for protests or demonstrations,"" the statement read. ""However, we encourage anyone planning an assembly, demonstration or rally to let Victoria Police and the City of Melbourne know so that we can plan for any effects on parks, public places, streets and footpaths and notify affected businesses and services. ""We are working with Victoria Police in relation to any possible protests that may occur over the weekend.""   Local Chinese media City Discount reported on their WeChat account later on the same day that the pro-China rally has been postponed to an unspecified date. The ABC understands that  pro-democracy protests will go ahead as planned, and Victoria Police has also confirmed to the ABC that it was aware of protest activity planned in Melbourne CBD on Saturday.   It is unclear who originally posted the fabricated council letter on WeChat and what their intention is, but local Chinese media have speculated on WeChat that it was planted by a pro-democracy protester as ""a trap"" to lure pro-China protesters to rally on Saturday.   Sydney Post's editor-in-chief, who writes under the penname Xiao Shi Yi Lang, published an article on Wednesday saying the pro-China protest planned in Melbourne was ""actually a fake protest"" and ""a trap"" designed by pro-democracy protesters to lure more people to their demonstration at the State Library on Saturday. ""It isn't a prank, but a sophisticated trap,"" he said in an article that has since been removed from Sydney Post's website. City Discount also published a report speculating that the fake letter was ""very likely"" to be ""misinformation from separatist forces"". The report said if pro-China protesters were to have shown up at the now-postponed rally, they would have been ""trapped"" and faced ""provocation"" from the pro-democracy camp. When the ABC asked Xiao Shi Yi Lang to explain how he knew the fake council approval letter was ""a trap"" set by a pro-democracy protester, he told the ABC that he could not confirm whether the person was from the pro-democracy or pro-China camp. In fact, he said he only knew that the person's WeChat nickname is ""1994%"" and came to this conclusion after joining several private Sydney and Melbourne-based WeChat groups and speaking with various Chinese netizens. The ABC attempted to contact ""1994%"" and a WeChat user who is believed to be the organiser of the pro-China protest in Beijing, but both accounts appear to have been deregistered or had their account names changed.   Since the City of Melbourne has dismissed the letter as fake, it has emerged that the councillor's name and signature at the bottom of the letter, Cath Hewitt — who the letter said was the manager of health and activity approvals at the City of Melbourne — was also forged. The City of Perth said in a reply on Twitter to a journalist that Cath was in fact a City of Perth employee, and ""her name and details have been used fraudulently to appear to give some authentication to the event.""   While both city councils have clarified their positions on Twitter, it's unlikely their messages have filtered through to Chinese netizens — the majority of whom saw the fake letter on WeChat. Well-known WeChat media accounts in Australia, including CN2MEL, Australian Red Scarf, and Sydney Impression have all widely publicised the ""Support One China Principle"" demonstration using the fake protest letter to encourage Chinese community members to join the parade. A spokesperson for CN2MEL admitted to the ABC that the media outlet published the picture of the fake approval letter without verifying it first, adding that he first saw the letter on ""WeChat moment"", which is a sharing function similar to Facebook timeline. ""We collect and show all sorts of information to netizens, and it's up to the netizens to determine the authenticity for themselves,"" the spokesperson said, adding they would update their article and apologise to readers about the fake letter. He added that while many local Chinese media outlets call themselves ""media"", they function more as news translation and integration services compared with conventional media. ""[They're intended to] give the Chinese community a space for discussion."" Australian Red Scarf and Sydney Impression have both declined ABC's interview requests. In Sydney, the pro-China camp will push ahead with their planned rally on Saturday in Belmore Park — the same location the pro-Hong Kong camp will host their demonstration on Sunday. A NSW police spokesman told the ABC ""the [Pro-China] protest has been permitted for Saturday 17, August 2019, and is anticipated to be a peaceful demonstration"".

75	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-16/tiananmen-square-protest-organiser-hong-kong-conflict/11416754	August 16, 2019	Tiananmen Square organiser fears Hong Kong protests will come to 'showdown moment'	"Thirty years ago Wu'er Kaixi helped organise pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square. Now he is watching protests in Hong Kong and waiting for a government crackdown to silence protesters.   For his role organising the Tiananmen protests he ended up number two on China's 1989 most wanted list and now lives in exile in Taiwan. ""I was one of the founders of the student movement, commonly known as the Tiananmen student movement, which ended when the Chinese mobilised standing troops to come into the city and massacred peaceful protesters,"" he said.  Mr Wu'er said the situation in Hong Kong was a very familiar story. He said if he was not banned from travelling to the city, he would be there.   ""The central government do not want to give its people freedom,"" he said. ""It's an identical part [of the two events], it's the same enemy of the people that links the two demonstrations; one in Beijing 30 years ago and one in Hong Kong going on today."" He fears the response to the protests unfolding in Hong Kong will be the same as the response in Tiananmen 30 years ago.   ""Unfortunately, the enemy that we're facing do not know any tricks when confronted by people with determination,"" he said. ""Thirty years ago they deployed troops and I'm afraid this time they're thinking of doing the same.""   Protests have been rolling through Hong Kong, spreading from the centre of the city into the suburbs, for over two months.  They started as a response to a controversial extradition bill, which could have seen Hong Kong residents taken to China to face trial.   The Hong Kong Government withdrew the bill in July, with leader Carrie Lam admitting even she was not in support of it. ""I have almost immediately put a stop to the amendment exercise, but there are still lingering doubts about the government's sincerity or worries [about] whether the government will restart the process in the Legislative Council,"" she said. ""So I reiterate here, there is no such plan. The bill is dead."" The withdrawal has not satisfied protesters though, who are fearful the central government in Beijing will keep trying to exert more power in Hong Kong.  They say they are fighting against the erosion of the ""one country, two systems' arrangement which gives Hong Kong some autonomy from China. Clashes between police and protesters have become an almost daily occurrence and this week an occupation of the city's airport shut it down for days.   The organisation and tactics of protesters in Hong Kong have impressed Mr Wu'er. ""The Hongkongers this time have developed this very clever tactic that it is a leaderless organisation, unlike in 1989 when we needed a student organisation, we needed a negotiator,"" he said. ""We were willing even to compromise back in 1989, if the government would give us something. ""But 30 years later, I think Hongkongers know one thing: the matter of freedom there has no room for compromise."" Recently, the central government in Beijing said protests were beginning to show ""sprouts of terrorism"" and satellite photos have found what appears to be a build-up of Chinese military vehicles near the border with Hong Kong. The pictures, released by Maxar Technologies, appear show more than a 100 troop carriers and other vehicles inside a sports centre in Shenzhen, the closest mainland Chinese city to Hong Kong.   Police have fended off attacks by protesters and the protestors have allegedly been assaulted by gang members paid to rough them up, but Mr Wu'er fears the situation could escalate. ""Perhaps they realise the brutal clubbing by the police is not enough, not sufficient to scare the Hong Kong people off, so they probably will escalate that into a new level I'm afraid,"" he said.  ""I am extremely afraid there will be human life lost."" While Hongkongers supported protesters in Tiananmen in 1989 with mass vigils held in solidarity, Mr Wu'er said the people of Hong Kong had been comfortable with the status quo in their own city.  ""Hong Kong, a city of six to seven million people, has always been a business driven society and the people were business minded, meaning conservative and a little bit scared all the time,"" he said. ""They wanted to maintain peace, stability and order. ""This time I think I have seen through the two months, with more than 60 days of demonstrations, the faces of Hongkongers have transformed. ""They want their freedom more than their stability. ""They have transformed, this business-minded, conservative, oriental society is now a city of seven million democracy activists.""   He now feels this movement has grown to a point where conflict is inevitable.  ""Any movement that has come to this scale has already developed it's own character and it's own spirit,"" he said. ""I think it will come to the showdown moment."" The Chinese government's goal if it comes to a showdown, according to Mr Wu'er, would be to scare the people to the point where they are afraid to protest. ""Beijing would probably think that a crackdown would instil enough fear in the society,"" he said. ""They did it in 1989 and they're confident if they do it again it will have the same effect, I think that's the mentality of Beijing that worries me."""	ABC (Australia)

The pictures appear to show more than 100 vehicles sitting in and around the soccer stadium at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre, just north of the Asian financial hub that has been rocked by more than two months of near-daily street demonstrations. The images were released by Maxar Technologies, a space technology company known to release satellite images of different parts of the world.  CNN reporters in Shenzhen also confirmed seeing dozens of troop carriers and at least one armoured personnel carrier. Earlier this week, China's state media reported that forces had been assembled for training exercises in the  border city, adding to fears that Beijing might directly intervene in Hong Kong.   Chinese state media has said only that the Shenzhen exercises had been planned beforehand and were not directly related to the unrest in Hong Kong, although they came shortly after the central Government in Beijing said the protests were beginning to show the ""sprouts of terrorism"". State broadcaster CCTV aired footage on Wednesday of a mass anti-riot police drill held on August 6 in Shenzhen. The Shenzhen Public Security Bureau drill involved 12,000 police officers, 50 armoured vehicles, 200 assault vehicles, 1,200 motorbikes, five helicopters, eight boats, and two amphibious vehicles, official state news agency Xinhua said. The drills covered three subjects: anti-terrorist measures, joint sea and air patrols, and riot prevention, Xinhua added.    Commenting before the release of the satellite images, President Donald Trump tweeted that US intelligence believed that the Chinese Government was moving troops to its border with Hong Kong and that, ""Everyone should be calm and safe!""   Mr Trump also retweeted footage of troop movements in Shenzhen posted by Alexandre Krauss, a senior political adviser at Renew Europe, which appeared to show military vehicles entering the sports stadium. ""Something extraordinarily bad is about [to] happen,"" Mr Krauss tweeted. Beijing has not sent in police or army units from the mainland or mobilised the People's Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong to quell the unrest.  It is seen as mindful of the devastating effect that would have both on the territory's reputation as a safe and stable place to invest, and as an indication of the Communist Party's failure to win over the hearts and minds of the city's 7.3 million residents.     Ten weeks of increasingly violent confrontations between police and protesters have plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis since it reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997. President Donald Trump tied a US trade deal with China to the humane resolution of the situation, hours after the State Department said it was ""deeply concerned"" about reports of movement of Chinese paramilitary forces along the border. The State Department warned that continued erosion of the territory's autonomy put at risk the preferential status it enjoys under US law. Mr Trump, in his remarks on Twitter, appeared to suggest a personal meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping to help resolve the crisis.   ""Of course China wants to make a deal. Let them work humanely with Hong Kong first!"" Mr Trump said on Twitter.  ""I have ZERO doubt that if President Xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem, he can do it. Personal meeting?""   In his tweets on Wednesday, Mr Trump also said that his delay in 10 per cent tariffs on more than $150 billion in Chinese imports from September to December ""will be reciprocated"" by China and the ""much good will come from the short deferral to December"". Flights resumed on Wednesday amid heightened security at Hong Kong airport, which is one of the world's busiest, after two days of disruptions sparked by protesters swarming the airport. China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing called the behaviour at the airport no different to terrorism and said it must be severely punished. China used its strongest language yet after Tuesday's incidents, when the protesters seized a reporter from China's Global Times newspaper, a nationalistic tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, and harassed the man they believed to be a mainland agent. In addition to Beijing's condemnation, the People's Daily called for ""using the sword of the law"" to restore order, and mainland social media users lauded the detained reporter as a hero.

It goes to an issue crucial to our position in a world economic order that is likely to be shaped less by the United States, still our most important ally, and more by China, our ever-more-valuable trading partner. At the heart of the Hong Kong protests is the same issue that causes concern about China's ambitions from the South China Sea to the South Pacific. It's about the Chinese Government's commitment to an idiosyncratic idea of the rule of law. Hong Kong has something like a constitution or bill of rights, called the Hong Kong Basic Law. It's a legacy of British colonial rule, which the Chinese Government agreed to preserve because there was value in keeping Hong Kong the prosperous city it had become. China has a very different approach to law. Its constitution can and has been changed at the whim of the ruling party. There is no separation of powers, and no such thing as an independent judiciary.   The trigger for the Hong Kong protests was a proposed law enabling China to extradite Hong Kong residents and visitors. Protesters foresaw democrats and dissidents disappearing into China's prison system. The judicial ""firewall"" — giving meaning to the notion of ""one country, two systems"" — would be fatally undermined. Hong Kong's distinctive culture and economy would be destroyed with it.   The idea of law as an instrument of the Chinese Communist Party shapes the Chinese Government's domestic policies, and its approach to international law.  It respects international conventions when it has to, and when it is in the national interest. But there's a point where it is quite willing to thumb its nose at the whole idea. This willingness has stiffened under the leadership of Xi Jinping, who has reaffirmed in word and deed that the Chinese Communist Party ""is the highest force for political leadership"". An example is China's view of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in its dispute with the Philippines over island territory in the South China Sea.   In 2016, a UN tribunal unanimously found in favour of the Philippines. China refused to accept the verdict. It declared it ""would continue to abide by international law and basic norms governing international relations"", but also added: ""The Chinese Government reiterates that, regarding territorial issues and maritime delimitation disputes, China does not accept any means of third-party dispute settlement or any solution imposed on China."" It therefore continues to claim the South China Sea as an ""inalienable"" part of its territory. In direct defiance of the ruling, it has also built artificial islands within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, and built military bases on those islands.   China's official narrative is that it doesn't reject international law per se, but simply wants law that accommodates ""Chinese characteristics"", including China's preference for resolving disputes one on one. Given that the point of establishing the United Nations and other multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organisation was to replace ""might makes right"" with something like an international rule of law, this is likely to prove cold comfort for smaller nations. As Mr Xi told the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 2017:   Beijing's view of the rule of law is thus very different to what most of the rest of the world understands. The potential consequences are not lost on the citizens of Hong Kong, and they should not be lost on China's neighbours and trading partners.

The Dow Jones index tumbled 391 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 25,893. The benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq indices dropped 1.2 per cent each.   Investor sentiment was also weighed down by the intensifying Hong Kong protests, the protracted US-China trade war, and a plunge in Argentina's currency and stock markets. As investors fled from risky assets, they piled into safe haven assets like spot gold, which jumped 1 per cent to $US1,512 an ounce. The Japanese currency also jumped 0.8 per cent — one Australian dollar is buying 71.05 yen, its lowest level in more than 10 years. The retreat to safer investments also led to a fall in America's long-term interest rates, with its 10-year Treasury bond yield sinking to 1.64 per cent. Despite the foreign market sell-off, the ASX 200 slipped by just 0.3 per cent to 6,569 points at 1:45pm (AEST).   Westpac outperformed its banking rivals, rising 0.2 per cent, after it won a case in the Federal Court, launched by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). ASIC argued unsuccessfully that the nation's second-largest bank had breached responsible lending laws up to 262,000 times. It fared better than the other major banks, with Commonwealth Bank (-0.4pc), ANZ (-0.3pc) and NAB (-0.2pc) . Shares in fund management firm Challenger jumped 6.5 per cent, and was the best performer on the local benchmark index. Challenger reported a flat full-year profit of $548 million, towards the lower end of what it had previously forecast. However, the company reiterated its profit outlook for the 2020 financial year ($500m - $500m) and maintained its final dividend at 18 cents per share. Healthcare stocks dragged down the market, with sharp losses for CSL (-1.2pc), Cochlear (-3.5pc) and Mayne Pharma Group (-2.1pc). On the flipside, mining giants Fortescue Metals (+3.4pc), BHP (+0.4pc) and Rio Tinto (+0.5pc) — which have been under pressure from falling iron ore prices — rebounded from yesterday's losses. Market sentiment turned sour after Argentina's peso plunged 15 per cent to 55.85, against the US greenback — and its benchmark stock index, the Merval, plummeted 38 per cent.   Combined with the currency slump, Argentina's main stock index lost around half its US dollar value in a day — the second worst one-day fall for a major share index, only eclipsed by Sri Lanka's one-day drop in 1989. This was after Argentinian voters snubbed the market-friendly president, centre-right leaning Mauricio Macri, by giving the opposition a greater-than-expected victory (a 15.5pc margin) in Sunday's primaries, ahead of the final election in October. The victory by populist candidate Alberto Fernandez — whose running mate is former left-wing Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner — ""paves the way for the return to left-wing populism that many investors fear,"" consultancy Capital Economics told clients. ""Argentine's and Hong Kong's travails have had some contagion effect to broader emerging markets,"" said NAB's head of foreign exchange strategy Ray Attrill. The JP Morgan EM FX index has fallen about 4 per cent since late-July, and is almost down to a one-year low, he said. ""This is a key factor behind our recently downgraded forecasts for both the Australian and New Zealand dollars."" However, OANDA senior market analyst Jeffrey Halley believes the fallout will be ""fairly localised"". ""Argentina belongs to that special economic management club that counts countries such as Venezuela, Zimbabwe and North Korea among its members. ""What it does highlight is that economic populism is alive and well in all corners of the globe — a far more worrying development in the long-term than a US-China trade war."" Investors also retreated from stocks after Hong Kong's airport cancelled all flights, as the pro-democracy protests continue with no end in sight.   ""Fear is rising that the economic damage to the region could be long-lasting, as it is far from clear how the escalating tension, now ten weeks old, is going to be resolved,"" said ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch. ""These developments will increase tension with mainland China and damage the Hong Kong economy, with growing fears that the region will enter recession."" Furthermore, the protracted trade dispute between Washington and Beijing over trade could lead to recession and is unlikely to be resolved before the next US election in 2020, according to economists from Goldman Sachs. ""We expect tariffs targeting the remaining $US300 billion of US imports from China to go into effect,"" the investment bank said in a note sent to clients on Sunday. US President Donald Trump announced, earlier this month, that he would impose a 10 per cent tariff on a final $US300 billion worth of Chinese imports on September 1. This prompted China to let its currency weaken to an 11-year low and halt purchases of US agricultural products. ""Overall, we have increased our estimate of the growth impact of the trade war,"" the bank said in the note authored by three of its economists, Jan Hatzius, Alec Phillips and David Mericle. The Goldman Sachs economists lowered their fourth-quarter US growth forecast by 20 basis points to 1.8 per cent due to a larger-than-expected impact from the developments in the trade tensions.

"A younger generation of Taiwanese is confronting an increasingly hard-line attitude from its nearest neighbour.   At a rain-soaked music festival in the southern Taiwanese city of Chiayi, Foreign Correspondent caught up with Freddy Lim, as he revved up his young fans about Hong Kong. ""Democracy is not just important for Taiwan, but for all oppressed people, including our friends in Hong Kong, right?"" he asks the adoring crowd of thousands. The death metal rocker, complete with black make-up across his face, is lead singer of Chthonic, one of Asia's biggest death metal bands. The head-banging fans are enthralled as Lim delivers the message: ""Only if Taiwanese are united can we overcome all difficulties!"" The crowd answers with chants for independence.   For years Chthonic has been a musical and political force on the self-ruled island of 23 million people. But for the past few years, Lim has preferred political battles in the parliamentary arena, where a role on Taiwan's Parliamentary National Security and Defence Committee has sharpened his focus on China. The New Power Party, co-founded by Lim, has harnessed the passion of a younger generation that increasingly identifies as Taiwanese — not Chinese. Lim recently split with the party and now sits as an independent, but maintains his uncompromising views. ""Am I afraid we are crossing red lines? And something bad might happen? I think the Chinese Government just keeps moving the lines, even when we hold back,"" he said from his office in Taipei's Legislative Yuan office building. ""Now there are no lines. It's just: 'If you do anything, I'll kick your arse'."" For nearly four years, Beijing's been waging a pressure campaign against Taiwan's left-leaning President, Tsai Ing-wen.   Ms Tsai leads the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is backed by a coalition that includes the inked, ponytailed and passionate Lim. Threats of blockades and invasion from Communist China have ramped up, with Peoples' Liberation Army drills in the waters around Taiwan now taking place. On the political front, China has been busy too. It has poached five of the 22 diplomatic allies that recognised Taiwan's Government when Ms Tsai took over in 2016.  Last month, China announced fresh restrictions on individual tourism to Taiwan to put an economic squeeze on the island.  International brands like Qantas and Marriott Hotels have increasingly been targeted by China or online Chinese nationalists for not rigidly adhering to the Communist Party's claim to the island. Taiwan's sovereignty has remained unfinished business since the Nationalists fled there after being defeated in 1949 by the Communists in China's civil war.  Ms Tsai cautiously balances the growing demands of a younger generation calling for independence, with the dire consequences of pushing China too far. Beijing is wary Ms Tsai and her supporters will make small moves towards formal independence if given the chance, and Chinese leaders are fond of saying they will resort to force to ensure that never happens.   ""If you believe in democracy, I think the people here are already saying, 'We are not interested in unification with China',"" Taiwan's Foreign Minister, Joseph Wu, said. ""We understand our responsibilities in preventing war from taking place, and we are taking a very prudent approach towards China."" Beijing's pressure campaign and the pushback in Hong Kong is setting up an electrifying presidential election battle in Taiwan over the next five months.    Ms Tsai will face off against a populist mayor hoping to restore the more conservative Kuomintang (KMT) to power.  The KMT agrees Taiwan and the mainland are one country, despite being separately ruled, a position Ms Tsai does not acknowledge. But the upheaval in Hong Kong has eroded poll momentum for the KMT's candidate, Han Kuo-yu, seen as much friendlier towards the mainland. As the protests first erupted in Hong Kong, Mr Han moved to assure supporters he would only accept China's offer of 'One Country, Two Systems' ""over my dead body"". Some news channels and papers in Taiwan's free and boisterous media have been accused of aiding KMT candidates with sycophantic coverage on behalf of mainland interests.  ""There's one major group that controls television, print magazines, whose owner has been making a fortune in China. And it has been revealed that the Chinese Government has been funding one of the related companies, to the order of hundreds of millions of US dollars over the past decade,"" J Michael Cole, a Taipei-based strategic analyst, said.   ""They test different techniques in Taiwan … disinformation is certainly an area where the Chinese have been very active, creating confusion about the current leadership in Taiwan,"" Mr Cole, a former Canadian intelligence officer, said. According to Mr Cole, this includes muddying the waters on a number of issues: ""The state of the economy, the workability of democracy, notions of inevitability when it comes to unification — the futility of resisting Beijing."" In recent weeks the UK's Financial Times has published allegations about Taiwan's Want Want Group, a major corporation with extensive media interests, claiming its editorial managers take orders from China's Government. The company has denied the allegations and is suing the Financial Times for defamation but Taiwan's Government remains convinced China is using covert means to interfere.  ""We have seen the Chinese are engaged in a disinformation campaign against various government institutions, to create distrust in the Government, and to create distrust in the democratic institutions,"" Mr Wu said.  Lim says it keeps him awake at night and confirms the parliamentary defence committee has sought advice from countries in the region, including Australia.  ""We try to learn what other countries are doing about that — like the Australian government,"" he said. ""Now you have the anti-interference law … and try to start a conversation between Taiwan, Japan, Australia and the US.""   All the diplomatic back and forth across the strait seems a long way from the islands of Kinmen, which have far more at stake if conflict ever flared up between the two sides. Just five kilometres from China, the islands face the bright lights of Xiamen — a city of nearly four million that highlights the mainland's economic might.   Once the target of Cold War-era artillery fire from the mainland, these days a special permit deal allows locals from both sides to cross the water easily. Chinese and Taiwanese flags line a prominent shopping street, and war fortifications and bunkers have now been surrendered to tourists. On Kinmen, there is little appetite for confrontational policies from leaders in Taiwan's capital, Taipei. ""Kinmen is like a bargaining chip for Taiwan when Taipei negotiates with the mainland,"" local politician Dong Senbao said. ""I am concerned Taiwan could give up Kinmen, but if it did, this would show Taiwan isn't a free and democratic country because that would mean it's abandoned its people."" For now, relations are far friendlier on the small islands off the coast than between the mainland and Taipei.   The bad blood between China and the ruling DPP, or pro-independence politicians like Lim, is countered by a small but vocal group of local communists.  Local Communist Party supporter Wei Minren said he would welcome the arrival of China's Peoples' Liberation Army in Taiwan — ""the sooner the better"". He and his group are increasingly buoyed by the assertive nationalism of Chinese President Xi Jinping — who has abolished term limits for himself and may be eyeing the unification of Taiwan as an historical legacy prize in his lifetime.  ""We support One Country, Two Systems. It's the best solution for Taiwanese,"" Mr Wei said.   That is the same system Beijing granted Hong Kong when the British handed it back in 1997 — a system that has come under sustained pressure from protesters in recent months who claim Beijing is violating the autonomy it promised.  In the wake of the Hong Kong protests, many Taiwanese are nervous similar unrest could occur if Beijing keeps tightening its grip.  It is a fine balancing act that almost everyone in Taiwan has to make — how to assert the freedoms that make Taiwan more liberal and open than mainland China, without poking the dragon.  It will only get harder in the years ahead but Lim and his supporters have already made their choice. ""We can't give up, because Taiwan is our home, we have nowhere to escape,"" he said. ""We just have to try to protect our way of life."" Watch Death Metal Diplomacy on Foreign Correspondent tonight on ABC TV at 8 pm AEDT Tuesday August 13th & Friday 16th August 1.30pm.

Hong Kong has been embroiled in increasingly violent anti-Government street protests for the past two months, which a top Chinese official described this week as the greatest crisis since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997.   Last week, a Cathay pilot was among more than 40 people charged with rioting for allegedly taking part in violent clashes with the police near Beijing's main representative office in the city. On Friday night, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said Cathay crew who have engaged in the protests pose a threat to aviation safety in mainland China, according to a statement on its website. The aviation authority ordered Cathay to provide identification information for its crew on mainland-bound flights. Crew members that have not gained the authority's approval will not be allowed into its airspace, including on flights bound for other destinations. The airline has also been ordered to draw up proposals to strengthen safety and security, said the statement.   In response, a Cathay Pacific spokesperson said: ""We have received the directive and are studying it very carefully. We are treating it seriously and are following up accordingly."" ""The safety of our passengers is always the top priority of Cathay Pacific. There is zero tolerance for any inappropriate and unprofessional behaviour that may affect aviation safety. We deal with these incidents very seriously.""   On Thursday, Cathay said it respects ""everyone's right to express themselves in a peaceful and respectful manner"", while insisting it ""recognises that Hong Kong [special administrative system] is a part of China"". ""We do not condone any activities that jeopardise the stability of Hong Kong,"" it said. On Monday aviation workers joined a strike that gridlocked Hong Kong, forcing airlines, including Cathay, to cancel hundreds of flights. Responding to a question on the protests at a press conference earlier this week, Cathay chairman John Slosar said the company respected its staff's opinions. ""We certainly wouldn't dream of telling them what they have to think about something. They're all adults, they're all service professionals. We respect them greatly,"" he said. Chinese state-owned media outlet Global Times ran news stories this week highlighting Cathay employees' participation in the ongoing protests, stating that its ""fence-sitting approach"" could ""taint its image"".   Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam told reporters that companies in the Asian financial hub were ""very worried"" about the economic fallout from the protests, which began in June and have become increasingly violent. Ms Lam urged an end to the violence, claiming that the protests were dragging on the city's economy. ""We have had two months of political dispute,"" she said after meeting business representatives and senior officials, warning that a downturn ""is coming very quickly"". ""Some people have described it as coming like a tsunami … the economic recovery will take a long time,"" she said. Reuters/ABC"	ABC (Australia)
87	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-10/hong-kong-protests-spread-across-australia/11398832	August 12, 2019	Hong Kong protests spread across Australia revealing deep divisions in Chinese community	"Protests and violent clashes in Hong Kong have spilled over onto Australian university campuses, revealing a deep division of opinions in the local Chinese community.   Student demonstrations between the pro-Hong Kong and pro-Beijing camps have broken out nationwide over the past fortnight, ranging from scuffles at the University of Queensland (UQ) to peaceful hours-long debates on the footpaths outside Monash University's Clayton campus in Melbourne. The demonstrations are usually organised by Hong Kong international students calling for democracy in the semi-autonomous region, and then countered by pro-Beijing students who see the protests as anti-China separatists activities.   Elvis Ma, a Hong Kong student from Monash University, has flown back home twice since the protests over the now-suspended extradition bill kicked off in June. He told the ABC the international students in Australia were just trying to raise awareness about what's happening back home. ""I think that's the only way we can help Hong Kong people,"" he said. ""Students from the mainland believe we are trying to make Hong Kong independent, but the fact is that we simply hope people can care about the extradition law, and how Hong Kong police attacked the protesters."" A spokesperson from the University of Tasmania's Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA) told the ABC the body ""deeply supports national unity of the People's Republic of China and opposes every action or comment that aimed at dividing China."" The difference of opinions have sparked disputes at half a dozen campuses including the University of New South Wales, Australian National University, University of Tasmania and Monash University with more demonstrations planned in Sydney and Melbourne next week.   Pro-Beijing residents in Sydney and Melbourne also announced their plans yesterday to protest against the ""riots"" in Hong Kong in their respective CBDs on Saturday, August 17 . While the protests are rooted in the widespread discontent over Hong Kong's now-suspended extradition bill, they also reflect the diverse views in Australia's Chinese community, which accounts for more than 1.2 million of the 25 million national population. The views are as varied as the people who make up the community itself — from new migrants and international students, to second and third generation Chinese Australians, and to ethnic Chinese from Indonesia and Malaysia.   Last month, Gladys Liu, the first Chinese-Australian woman to sit in the Federal Parliament's Lower House, publicly endorsed the protest movement in her birthplace of Hong Kong and what it was hoping to achieve. ""The significant number of people in Hong Kong who have taken to the streets to voice their concerns demonstrates to the world the kind of passion and commitment to democracy that the people of Hong Kong hold,"" she said. Ms Liu did not respond directly to the ABC's questions to clarify whether she also supported the student protests spreading across Australia's university campuses, instead saying she urged protesters to conduct themselves in a peaceful and orderly manner. ""As I have previously said, peaceful dialogue is the best course of action to resolve any dispute, consistent with both Australia's democratic values and with the established democratic practices of Hong Kong, valued by Australia and many around the world,"" Ms Liu told the ABC in a statement.   However, on Thursday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs made their position clear by defending recent remarks by the Chinese consul-general in Brisbane, Xu Jie, following the protests at UQ on July 24. Mr Xu said the consulate affirms ""the spontaneous patriotic behaviour of Chinese students, resolutely opposes the words and deeds of any separatist countries, and opposes the use of these events to create the opposition between Chinese and Hong Kong students and incite anti-China sentiment"". The Foreign Ministry's spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at the regular press briefing on Thursday evening that Mr Xu's remarks echoed Beijing's position on matters concerning China's sovereignty and the Chinese students' safety, legal rights and interests. ""A very small number of people with ulterior motives conducted anti-China separatist activities at Queensland University, which caused indignation and protests by Chinese overseas students, including those from the mainland and Hong Kong,"" she said. ""[Mr Xu's] relevant statement is comprehensive, accurate and beyond reproach. ""The so-called allegation of 'interfering [in] Australia's internal affairs' and 'inciting campus violence' is nothing but fabrications and slanders."" The Chinese embassy in Canberra also backed Mr Xu, saying his comments were ""appropriate and measured"".   Observers including student leaders of the protests say the heated debate over the recent events has been fuelled by Chinese media reports on WeChat in Australia, the majority of which have misrepresented the nature of the demonstrations.  WeChat, a popular Chinese social media platform, is the main source of news for the local Chinese community in Australia. On Tuesday, about 50 international students from Hong Kong gathered at Monash University's Clayton campus in the morning to demonstrate against China's violation of the autonomy Hong Kong was promised under the One Country, Two Systems model and to demand the full withdrawal of the now-shelved extradition bill.   They protested peacefully by sticking signs and memos on their clothes to clarify that they were ""not pro-independence, but pro-democracy"" for Hong Kong. But several reports covering the protest on WeChat described the students as ""pro-independence Hongkongers"" and ""toxic Hongkongers"", while other articles exaggerated the confrontation between the pro-Hong Kong and pro-Beijing students. It was reported that a Chinese pro-democracy student, Omar Ma, was ""bashed up and sent to the Royal Melbourne Hospital"" after he called the pro-Beijing students ""Zhina"", a derogatory word that was widely regarded as a racial slur used by the Japanese during the World War II. But Mr Ma and other eyewitnesses told the ABC the incident was non violent, adding that biased reports were spreading misinformation.  Hong Kong community leader in Melbourne, Jane Poon, added that fake news could give people the wrong perception which ""can cause ethnic division and damage the harmony"" in the community. ""It is extremely dangerous to Australian society, especially with such a huge number of residents [making up the] Chinese community,"" she said. And while the student protests have been widely portrayed to be a conflict between people from Hong Kong and mainland China, the reality is many students from China are also part of the pro-democracy movement.   University campus walls covered with posters and sticky notes mirroring the ""Lennon Wall"" in Hong Kong — where activists have pinned thousands of notes stating their protest demands — have also become a flashpoint for conflict. And some of the slogans written by the pro-Hong Kong students including ""free Hong Kong"" and ""fight for freedom"" have been interpreted as a push for independence, rather than democracy. Last week two mainland students disrupted a protest at the Australian National University by standing in front of the Lennon Wall to stop others from sticking memos.   Hong Kong student Claudia Ng told the ABC students from mainland China replaced posters and quotes on the wall with some nationalist memos, emphasising Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong. ""I think we should all respect the right [of freedom of speech] in Australia, given it is a core value here,"" she said. ""We also met students from the mainland who came to support us, but they could not speak out [because they want to protect their identity]. ""Many people in China also knew what happened, but they are scared to talk about it because of the social context, and I can understand them,"" she said.

Only the more extreme rhetoric, or biggest threat, or, dare one say, sharpest three- or four-word slogan seems to penetrate through the fog, while the bigger picture of what is at stake either gets lost, or quickly forgotten once the headline issue has been dealt with. There has been plenty of this abroad in this week when the one big story that looms up wherever you look is China. A week ago, the story was all about whether the United States wanted us to have missiles in Darwin. It took a few days of bumbling to knock that on the head, but once it had been ruled out, the broader messages US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper were delivering seemed to get lost. These were messages about the preparedness of the US to escalate strategic tensions in the Asia-Pacific by pushing for ground-based missiles, and the United States' willingness to drop Australia right into heightened diplomatic tensions with Beijing by clearly exhorting Australia to back Washington's stance against China. That these messages seemed to get lost after a couple of days might be explained by the fact there were even more alarming China-related stories erupting: the upgrading of US/China trade tensions into a currency war; and an increasingly ugly situation in Hong Kong. The decision of the Chinese to devalue their currency on Monday in response to increased US trade sanctions shook financial markets, with ramifications for the value of the Australian dollar and the value of Australian investments. Equally, what is happening now in Hong Kong — with an escalation of aggressive warnings to protesters this week by Beijing — seems to make the prospect of a significant crackdown there now very likely. Yet what has captured the debate — or at least the headlines — is the comparison a government backbencher, Andrew Hastie, has made between China and the French failure to recognise the threat from Hitler's Germany in 1940. There was immediately an outcry about any comparisons to the Nazi regime, and very little discussion of the strategic argument Mr Hastie was making.   Asked to respond to Mr Hastie's comparison, rather than comment on actual developments in China, the Prime Minister downplayed his backbencher's comments. But in doing so, Scott Morrison seemed to betray the bitter reality that the Government doesn't actually have any idea what to do about either the growing US/China tensions, or the growing Chinese belligerence, which it now believes extends to building a new military base in Cambodia. ""I just refer to the speech I gave a few months ago, before I went to the G20, and I set out pretty clearly what the challenges were there and continuing to successfully manage our strategic allies and comprehensive strategic partners"", Mr Morrison said. Yep, ""see above"" is always such a powerful bit of persuasive leadership. And there was more. When asked about the observation by banking royal commissioner Kenneth Hayne that the use of slogans is undermining institutions in the place of policy debate, the Prime Minister said: ""Well, I did stop the boats and people who do have a go do get a go under my policies, so I think that's a pretty good plan. Cheers."" Mr Hayne noted in a speech last month: ""Political rhetoric now resorts to the language of war, seeking to portray opposing views as presenting existential threats to society as we now know it."" Yet the great irony of our politics is that even while domestic politics increasingly resorts to the language of war, our political leaders seem so incapable of mastering language, or even canvassing the issues, to deal with the very real increase in strategic and economic tensions which we now face. On Tuesday, an official from the Chinese Government's Hong Kong office had an ominous warning for protesters. ""We would like to make it clear to the very small group of unscrupulous and violent criminals and the dirty forces behind them: those who play with fire will perish by it.""   There has been a view abroad that Beijing would be exceptionally reluctant to intervene in any heavy-handed way in Hong Kong because it knows how damaging that would be. The Australian National University's Hugh White says it is a mistake to presume this. The Hong Kong protests, he says, are seen in Beijing as a threat to order, government authority and control over its sovereign territory.   Beijing is conscious it would be a bad look to stage a crackdown but it would be willing to accept that if the alternative is a serious erosion of its control. The question is how heavy handed it might be. We have already seen pro-Beijing mobs, sometimes linked to Chinese triads, taking on the protesters. Professor White says there are two conflicting imperatives confronting Beijing about how it might intervene, just as there are over the question of whether it intervenes at all. One option is to keep it as low key as possible, the second: to send an unambiguous message to Hong Kongers, the rest of China and, for that matter the rest of the world. After all, what would the rest of the world do? For which read, what would America do? Given the response to Tiananmen Square 30 years ago — when China was a much smaller player on the world stage — the answer is probably ""not much"". The response of President Donald Trump to developments in Hong Kong to date, despite all his anti-Chinese bluster, is instructive.   Asked on Thursday whether he was concerned by media reports that China might intervene in Hong Kong, the President said the city had experienced ""riots"" for a long period of time. ""Hong Kong is a part of China, they'll have to deal with that themselves"", he noted. It must have been music to Beijing's ears. Riots are not something other countries get involved in of course. An intervention — whatever its form — would, however, likely become part of the escalating strategic battle, including as another test by both China and the US about whether we have an independent view of what happens in Hong Kong. Whether events unfolding there are enough to break us out of our torpor is a very big question. Laura Tingle is 7.30's chief political correspondent."	ABC (Australia)

But the seemingly endless and increasingly violent protests paralysing the city are spreading fear among travellers and they are now staying away. Take a walk down Canton Road, a famous thoroughfare lined with a dazzling array of luxury boutiques like Gucci, Dior and Prada, and it is easy to see impact the unrest is having.  In most of the stores, there are more staff than customers. When the ABC went inside, we were eagerly greeted by four or five staff members who were keen to make a sale, only to be disappointed when asked for an interview.   None of the managers wanted to identify themselves, but one agreed to speak anonymously. He said he cannot portray his political views publicly and must stay ""neutral"" and even ""quiet"" on the subject.   ""We mainly cater for tourist business. In fact, the majority of sales is from tourists — tourists from China,"" he said. The manager said it was clear wealthy people in mainland China were aware of the turmoil in Hong Kong. ""It's definitely affecting the number of people coming in. I would say sales have dropped, definitely by double digits — the 30 to 50 per cent range,"" he said. It is a worrying sign for consumer brands and luxury retailers, which have become dependent on Hong Kong as a top destination for millions of shoppers from mainland China each year.  What started as a peaceful demonstration over a controversial extradition bill has morphed into a violent movement against China's tightening grip over the former British colony.    Protesters have co-ordinated simultaneous rallies across the city and into the suburbs while police have responded with growing force, firing tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters.  More than 500 protesters have been injured and many more arrested, while police have fired close to 2,000 rounds of tear gas.  At times, key districts have been blocked by barricades, including the popular shopping district in Causeway Bay, which became engulfed in tear gas last week.    A local resident from Tsim Sha Tsui, who did not want to be identified, told the ABC the violence was frightening people away. ""We can see the tourist numbers in Canton Road have really decreased,"" she said. ""They are frightening people away, they see the online coverage about things happening in Hong Kong right now and they think it's really violent. It has really influenced their perception of Hong Kong."" Luxury sales for June in Hong Kong were down more than 17 per cent on the previous year, according to S&P Global.   The Hong Kong Government also released its own figures, which showed sales of jewellery, watches, clocks and valuable gifts at retail outlets in June dropped to $1 billion, down from $1.32 billion last year.  Total retail sales for last month are estimated at $6.6 billion, almost 7 per cent below June last year. The Kering company, which owns Gucci, Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga, said it expected underperformance in Hong Kong due to the protests. Prada said Hong Kong had also been a drag on sales in Asia while Hugo Boss has closed its airport store, and one in Hong Kong's luxury strip. Ralph Lauren has closed three stores in the city.   Hong Kong's finance chief, Paul Chan Mo-po, this week warned the city's economy could plunge into recession if it continued to be rocked by escalating turmoil in the streets and the global trade war. He issued the grave warning as the financial hub was paralysed by flight cancellations, commuter chaos, traffic jams and service disruptions when thousands of people joined the largest citywide strike in decades on Monday. Analysts estimated the economic cost of the day of protests could be up to $487 million. Cathay Pacific, the territory's national carrier, said it had suffered a double-digit fall in ticket sales for travel to the city, due to the social unrest.    ""Hong Kong's economy is facing a very difficult situation,"" Mr Chan said. ""It is facing very big downward pressure as it has to deal with the ongoing US-China trade war and internal challenges at the same time."" China's state council on Hong Kong has also spoken out, blaming protesters for destroying the city's economy. ""For the past two months, the attacks have caused a serious impact on the economic development and people's wellbeing in Hong Kong,"" said Yang Guang, a spokesperson for China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office. Eighteen countries and regions have issued travel advisories for people considering going to Hong Kong. ""Worse still, the situation in Hong Kong has seriously dented the confidence of international investors, who have openly talked about their grave concerns about the business climate,"" he said.   The growing protests are also weighing on the neighbouring Chinese territory of Macau as visitors steer clear of the world's biggest gambling hub, worried over transport disruptions and safety concerns. Macau, which is an hour away by ferry from Hong Kong or a 30-minute drive from its international airport, reported a 3.5 per cent fall in gaming revenues in July.

Air, rail and bus services have been disrupted by another weekend of clashes between demonstrators and police that continued into Monday night (local time). Senior Superintendent Kong Wing-cheung of the Police Public Relations Branch told reporters he personally believed there was no chance of a deployment of the People's Liberation Army to quell the protests. He said Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and other officials had stated the same on multiple occasions. Speculation of an intervention by China's military has been fuelled in part by a slick publicity video it released last week showing troops firing tear gas and dealing with a mock street demonstration. Superintendent Kong said he did not feel the police were being made scapegoats over the violence and were fulfilling their mandate to protect the community and maintain law and order.   Weeks of protests have demanded the dissolution of the Hong Kong Government, an investigation into police use of force against protesters and full democracy for the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. A police spokeswoman said 420 protesters had been arrested since June 9 on charges including rioting, unlawful assembly, possessing offensive weapons, assaulting officers and obstruction operations. Police have fired more than 300 non-lethal bullets and about 1,000 tear gas grenades during the demonstrations. The spokeswoman said 139 officers had been injured in clashes, with two still hospitalised with fractures. Ms Lam has warned the recent protests have pushed the city to the ""verge of a very dangerous situation"" and threaten to destroy the city's prosperity. ""What is in front of us is Hong Kong's stability and Hong Kong's future,"" she said.    The Chinese-controlled city has been rocked by months of protests that began against an extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial and have since evolved into calls for greater democracy. The protests have at times shut government offices, blocked roads and disrupted businesses, posing the greatest political challenge to the former British colony since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Millions of people have taken to the streets to vent anger and frustration at the city's government, presenting the biggest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. Hong Kong tourist numbers are already falling and hotel occupancy rates are slumping as the protests take a toll, adding pressure to Hong Kong's already struggling economy.   More than 40 people were arrested on Sunday night as police fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators who moved swiftly across the city in flash mob-style actions. Hundreds of cars and buses were temporarily at a standstill when protesters blocked roads leading to a major cross-harbour tunnel. The disruptions continued into Monday, with activists calling for a citywide general strike, blocking public transit lines and freeways. Protesters snarled the morning rush hour by blocking train and platform doors to prevent trains from leaving stations. Subway and train operator MTR said services had been partially suspended on four lines because of a number of door obstruction incidents.   Long lines of traffic could be seen across Hong Kong island leading into the heart of the business centre, and hundreds of people were stranded at the airport, which has also had its rail service suspended. More than 100 flights were cancelled, according to Hong Kong media, with domestic carriers such as Cathay Pacific and Hong Kong Airlines most affected. ""The airport will start implementing flight rescheduling at 12:00pm, after which the number of flight movements handled will be lowered,"" Hong Kong International Airport (KHIA) told Channel News Asia.. Ms Lam accused protesters of using widespread disquiet over now-scrapped extradition laws as a cover to hide ""ulterior motives"".   ""Those ulterior motives are going to destroy Hong Kong,"" she said. ""They say want a revolution and to liberate Hong Kong. These (actions) are already far beyond their original political demands, and challenge our national sovereignty. These illegal actions endanger the 'one country, two systems', and destroy Hong Kong's prosperity."" When asked by a British reporter about why she had not resigned, Ms Lam said resignation would not ""provide a better solution"". ""It is a time for me to continue to lead my team to address [the] problems, and to bring Hong Kong out of its current difficult situation,"" she said. China's official Xinhua news agency said on Sunday: ""The central government will not sit idly by and let this situation continue. We firmly believe that Hong Kong will be able to overcome the difficulties and challenges ahead.""   ABC/wires"	ABC (Australia)
93	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-04/hong-kong-protests-kick-off-again/11381160	August 05, 2019	Hong Kong protests shut down shopping district as police respond with tear gas	"Hong Kong police have fired multiple tear gas rounds in confrontations with black-clad activists in the city's Kowloon area, as the Chinese-controlled territory was again rocked by anti-government protests.   It all began as a peaceful march, with protesters focusing their anger on Hong Kong's government and the city's police. But demonstrators soon cut down a Chinese flag and threw it in Victoria Harbour, then preceded to block major roads.   Police had kept out of sight during the afternoon as tens of thousands of protesters marched through Mong Kok, usually a busy shopping district. But they charged onto the streets after 9:00pm, with hundreds of officers in riot gear pushing back crowds who jeered them. The protesters created a barricade with umbrellas, metal road barriers and a bin as police protected by shields stayed put and raised tear gas warning banners. The protesters also set cardboard on fire to form a barrier. At around midnight in Wong Tai Sin, a residential area, protesters hurled umbrellas and other objects at police, who responded with pepper spray and then tear gas. The protesters set fires in the streets outside a police station and in rubbish bins and blocked the entrance to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, cutting a major artery linking Hong Kong island and the Kowloon peninsula. The city's summer of protest is stuck in a stalemate. Hong Kong's Beijing-appointed leader won't resign because China's government is backing her.   Thousands of supporters of Hong Kong's police, mostly wearing white, gathered for a separate rally on Saturday in Victoria Park in the Causeway Bay district of Hong Kong island. ""I really feel upset about the violence that we are seeing in Hong Kong every day,"" said Evan, 27, who works for a foreign bank in Hong Kong and turned out in support of police. ""The protesters are now not listening to the Government, they are not listening to the police. ""People have a right to express their opinion in a peaceful manner. We will continue to support the police and the authorities to implement rule of law here.""   Hong Kong police on Saturday called on protesters to stick to designated routes and times.   Any demonstrations that are not pre-approved will be ""cleared out"" as unlawful assemblies, police said. Hong Kong's summer of protests, sparked by an unpopular extradition bill, has continued unabated despite the Government's decision to suspend the legislation that would have sent some suspects to mainland China for trial. While the pro-democracy rallies have been largely peaceful, they have increasingly devolved into skirmishes with police after some protesters refused to disperse at assigned times.  In the past two months, protesters have vandalised buildings and thrown bricks, while police have fired tear gas and rubber bullets. A former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 under the framework of ""one country, two systems"". The city's mini-constitution promises the city certain freedoms not afforded to those in the mainland, but Hong Kongers say Beijing has chipped away at their autonomy in recent years.   Thousands of civil servants joined in the anti-government protests in Hong Kong for the first time since they started two months ago, defying a warning from the authorities to remain politically neutral.   Chanting encouragement, crowds turned out to support the civil servants at their rally on Friday evening which halted traffic on major roads in the heart of the city's business district. The rally came after an open letter penned anonymously and published on Facebook set out a series of demands to the Hong Kong Government by a group which said it represented civil servants. ""At present, the people of Hong Kong are already on the verge of collapse,"" the group wrote in the letter, saying it was ""a pity that we have seen extreme oppression."" The group also listed five demands: complete withdrawal of the extradition bill; a halt to descriptions of the protests as 'rioting'; a waiver of charges against those arrested; an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.   The protests against a now suspended extradition bill have widened to demand greater democracy and the resignation of Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam, and have become one of the gravest popular challenges to Communist Party rulers in Beijing.   China's new ambassador to the United Nations, Zhang Jun, said on Friday that Beijing supported the action taken by Hong Kong's government to ""bring back the normal order, the rule of law, the normal life of people"". ""The demonstration has gone far beyond the nature of a peaceful demonstration, it's really turning out to be chaotic and violent and we should no longer allow them to continue this reprehensible behaviour,"" Mr Zhang said.  ""We do not think that it's in the long-term interest of anyone."" There will also be a mass strike on Monday across sectors such as transport, schools and corporates. ""At this difficult moment, government colleagues have to stay united and work together to uphold the core values of the civil service,"" the Government said in a statement. In a warning to protesters, China's People's Liberation Army in Hong Kong on Wednesday released a video of ""anti-riot"" exercises and its top brass warned violence was ""absolutely impermissible"". The PLA has so far remained in barracks since protests started in April, leaving Hong Kong's police force to deal with protesters.   ABC/wires"	ABC (Australia)

""Do you want to go to the hospital? Come on, do you want some? Do you want some?"" the man shouts as a crowd surrounds them.  But the protester refuses to back down. The fourth blow to the head knocks the young demonstrator to the ground.  But still, with the help of his friends, he shakily gets back to his feet and stands his ground against the man.  Eventually, the older man turns to the wall behind him and begins tearing off the sticky notes bearing messages of support for Hong Kong's protest movement.  Bystander: ""Is anyone filming this? Someone film him!"" Man: ""I'll let you film me. You think you're tough? You think you're tough?""  Bystander: ""That's enough! Haven't you had enough?"" Man: ""Are you trying to start a revolution? What revolution are you trying to start?""   The video was filmed last month but has recently gone viral, further fuelling tensions in Hong Kong.  Police say they have charged the man who dished out the blows. But it is now just one of many violent incidences to rock the city, which is at the forefront of the line between relative freedom and the tight political control of mainland China.    The incident between the men occurred next to a so-called Lennon Wall in Kowloon Bay.   All over Hong Kong, these colourful walls have grown.  People have been writing their hopes, political demands and encouragement and sticking them onto walls in public spaces.  The first Lennon Wall appeared on the sides of the Hong Kong Legislature building in 2014, during the pro-democracy ""umbrella movement"", and featured Beatles lyrics. Five years later, they have again become a powerful symbol of resistance and have even spread across the world.  A Lennon Wall was even created at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra.  In a now-deleted video which circulated on social media this week, two Chinese international students stood guarding a section of a classroom wall this week.    On each side, other students posted sticky notes to support the anti-Beijing protestors in Hong Kong. An Australian voice could be heard using expletives to accuse the pair of defending a government that puts Muslims in gulags and abuses human rights. The argument at the ANU campus was a long way from Hong Kong.  But the spat is a snapshot of how the fight for Hong Kong's future — and more broadly against Beijing's authoritarianism — has gone global.  Clashes at the University of Queensland, Lennon Walls in Melbourne and flare-ups at campuses in other Western countries show what is at stake.    After the argument at ANU was recorded, pro-Beijing Chinese students later covered up many of the pro-Hong Kong messages on the wall with nationalist statements.  One included ""Those who insult China, their families are pigs"". ""If they beat us, we fight back,"" wrote a former University of Queensland graduate who goes by the handle Yang Xiaolinzi on social media platform Weibo.   ""If they insult us, we'll insult them back,"" he said.  One of the organisers of the pro-Hong Kong protest, an Australian named Tony Chang, was doxed on Chinese social media sites.  Nationalists posted photos of his ID cards, his passport and even his marriage certificate online.  ""It is an outpouring of nationalism of mainland Chinese students in reaction to what they perceive as an affront to national dignity,"" said Adam Ni, a China expert with Macquarie University. ""This is something that will become a bigger and bigger issue on Australian campuses in the future.""   While the Lennon Wall style of protest has been framed as a peaceful way to demonstrate, it has also further inflamed tensions in Hong Kong. Protesters claiming police brutality started writing personal details of security officers on the sticky notes, prompting police to remove them.  Pro-Beijing groups have also, at times, ripped down Lennon Walls in various parts of the city and replaced them with messages supportive of the police or the Chinese Government.  Such flare-ups are minor compared to the violence that has erupted on recent weekends here in Hong Kong.  There have been attacks on police at a shopping mall, organised crime attacks on protestors at a train station, and the continuous battles between demonstrators and riot police on Hong Kong's streets.  With the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) now strongly hinting at getting involved, speculation is swirling of a military intervention few thought possible when the protests first began.    However, experts say the PLA breaking up protests, as depicted in a propaganda video, remains unlikely.  Beijing seems to want to remind Hong Kong residents of the possibility of intervention while urging them to sort out the dispute themselves.  Whatever happens, the sticky notes, and the furious arguments around them in Hong Kong, Australia and further afield, are likely to continue sparking heated arguments.  "	ABC (Australia)

On Wednesday, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism made a surprise announcement that Beijing would suspend individual travel permits to Chinese tourists from 47 cities — including Beijing and Shanghai — effective August 1, meaning only tour groups will be allowed to visit the self-ruling island. The statement said the suspension was related to ""the current cross-strait relations"" but did not elaborate on the details. Last night Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying remained tight-lipped on the topic, despite being asked three times to explain Beijing's decision during a regular press briefing. In response to the announcement, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council expressed its stern protest and condemnation of China's latest move to restrict travel, adding that Taipei will discuss the issue with Beijing. Tensions have been rising between Beijing and Taipei over the past month, with US approving possible sales of $US2.2 billion ($AU2.8 billion) in tanks, missiles and related equipment to Taiwan. In response, China has warned the United States ""not to play with fire"" and threatened to sanction US companies that sell arms to Taiwan. Local media has cited President Tsai Ing-wen's recent stopover in the United States and her blatant remarks on the Hong Kong protests as possible reasons for the travel suspension.   But despite the surprise announcement, Chinese studies lecturer Mark Harrison told the ABC that the decision was ""too low-level"" to be a reaction to proposed arms sales — which Beijing already responded to — and was actually a suspension of a pilot individual visit program that was first introduced in 2011. ""The Chinese Government has already made representations to the US about the stop-over by President Tsai, so it is unlikely the tourism decision was directly connected to Tsai's visit, except as part of a broader policy calculus,"" he said. Dr Harrison believes the decision was likely related to upcoming Taiwan presidential elections in 2020, and given the specific timing, the decision had likely already been in the works for some time.  ""This might be part of broad thinking about 'what China can do in order to intervene in the election',"" Dr Harrison said. He added that it would allow Beijing to give preferred presidential candidate and Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu a situation that he would be able to solve. ""It's a calibrated action that is trying to avoid blowback against Beijing in ways that would hurt the presidential candidate they would prefer to see win,"" he said. ""It does give Han Kuo-yu something to say, and although it is very early days, he has had some headwinds in his campaign so far."" The major parties' campaigns have started to kick off, with independent Taipei City Mayor Ko Wen-je announcing a new political party this week called the Taiwan People's Party.   Beijing's announcement to suspend individual travel to Taiwan isn't the first time it has used tourism as a diplomatic weapon. Chinas also previously imposed a ban on Chinese tourists to the tiny Pacific nation of Palau — one of Taiwan's 17 remaining allies worldwide — which reportedly left hotels empty and an airline in limbo.   Earlier this year, Chinese state media also claimed Chinese tourists were abandoning New Zealand due to its decision to ban Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from operating in the country. However unlike Palau, Dr Harrison believes Taiwan would be able to absorb the impact of potentially lower numbers of tourists from mainland China, given the diversification in Taiwan's tourism markets. ""It is a targeted decision to stop individual tourism given that Beijing would know that the economic impact wouldn't be that great,"" he said. ""So they seem to be trying to find a way to address the election campaign and intervene in some form in Taiwanese politics in ways that don't overly antagonise Taiwanese citizens but still makes a statement.""   However, some experts have a different view, with one industry insider telling the South China Morning Post that Beijing's ban could result in 700,000 fewer arrivals over the next six months and cost Taiwan $NT28 billion ($US900.5 million) in lost revenue.  Permits issued to individual travellers before Thursday are reportedly still valid, but the move could impact travellers who had booked solo trips and were yet to obtain permission. Despite potential inconveniences, there has been a chorus of patriotic reactions from Chinese netizens on the travel suspension.   One user on Weibo called for Beijing to ""take back Taiwan"" because it would be a ""great gift for our motherland's 70th birthday"", referring to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1. ""When can I just bring my personal ID card to travel on the land of my own country?"" questioned another user. Some netizens also condemned Beijing's decision, with Twitter user Backfire saying ""[The Government] should not interfere with one's right to travel freely by imposing administrative approaches"".

Organisers anticipate thousands will today march to Yuen Long subway station in north-west Hong Kong — the site where last weekend club-wielding thugs thought to be members of triad criminal gangs attacked pro-democracy protesters.   On Thursday, Hong Kong police rejected an application submitted by Yuen Long local Max Chung to hold a protest, arguing they did not have the manpower to ensure people's safety.  They added that a clash between protesters and local residents was likely if the demonstration went ahead. Mr Chung told the ABC activists were wary of organising a protest in Yuen Long before last Sunday because of the area's reputation for being a triad stronghold.  But now the demonstrators want to flock there to demand justice, even if they are breaking the law. ""We are having it here … because of the terrorist attack [assaults against protesters] on July 21,"" Mr Chung said. ""Many people have told me about the potential danger and we have included precautionary measures in our plan."" While the mass protests were initially in opposition to the now-shelved bill for an extradition deal with China — an arrangement people feared would allow Beijing to silence dissidents — it has since evolved to express a general dissatisfaction over China's policies in Hong Kong.   Protesters say their message is spreading, with displays of dissent in Admiralty in the business district on Hong Kong island, to Kowloon, and now in the New Territories.   Dissatisfaction with the semi-autonomous region's Government and local police has also grown among many young people.  Although Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam declared the extradition law ""dead"" earlier this month, protesters have vowed to carry on. They want the pro-Beijing leader to step down.  But there are no signs that Hong Kong's Government is willing to compromise and fully withdraw the bill. Complicating matters, pro-police protests have taken place in recent weeks, led by mostly middle-aged and older Hongkongers incensed by constant disruptions caused by protests.   Pro-democracy group Civil Human Rights Front has issued five demands to Hong Kong's Government. Theye are: full withdrawal of the extradition bill, retraction of the ""riot"" characterisation of the protests which criminalises demonstators' activities, the release of all protesters who have been arrested, investigation of and accountability for police brutality, and Ms Lam's resignation. ""All they've been doing is playing with words,"" Mr Chung said. ""They [the Government] did respond, but it's like adding oil onto water. It only fuelled up the rage. That's how things are in the age of the internet. ""If they withdraw it [the bill] from the very beginning, it would have been over."" He said the ongoing tensions were taking a toll on young people's mental health.   According to local media, four young people have taken their own lives, leaving notes that linked their distress to the Hong Kong protests. ""People [pro-democracy campaigners] feel like what American people felt after September 11,"" Mr Chung said.  ""It's almost like they had PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder].""   On the same day as the incident at Yuen Long station, protesters defaced China's national emblem at Beijing's administrative headquarters in Hong Kong.  In the eyes of Beijing, the anti-extradition bill movement is ""striking against the root of Hong Kong's rule of law"".  Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China's Foreign Ministry, said in a press conference on Wednesday it was ""not fair"" to focus on triad violence at Yuen Long while ignoring alleged ""violent crime"" of pro-democracy protesters. On the same day, China's Defence Ministry adopted a harsher tone against the protesters by suggesting the People's Liberation Army would help to crack down on violence in Hong Kong if asked. Sharing Beijing's stance that the suspension of the bill was the most the Government could offer, an editorial published in the pro-Beijing Hong Kong Newspaper Takongpao last month argued that implementing the protesters' demands would ""bring disaster to Hong Kong"". Lo Chung-mau of Hong Kong University, a vocal pro-Beijing surgeon, declared during a pro-police rally on July 20 that Hong Kong was ""sick"" and violence was intolerable. ""Stop for a bit, give it deeper thought and check if you have done something wrong,"" Professor Lo said.   After last Sunday's triad incident in Yuen Long, observers say protesters are even less likely to back down. ""People taking part [in protests] clearly display outrage and dismay at police powers, as well as Carrie Lam's Government's rejection of the movement's demands for an independent investigation,"" Kenneth Chan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, told the ABC.   He said nobody could predict how many people would attend today's rally, but ""knowing Hong Kong people, I expected a huge turnout to protest against the Yuen Long rampage"".  Concerned about the potential for violence, chairman of Yuen Long district council, Shum Ho-kit, suggested the Government and other parties should swallow their prejudices and engage in dialogue. ""It's not just our society being filled with anxiety, Hong Kong's economy is also suffering the consequences,"" Mr Shum wrote on his Facebook page on July 22. ""There are many people discussing online on how to get round the police ban and go ahead with the protest,"" he told the ABC.  He said people living in Yuen Long ""feel frightened on any potential attack on their home, ancestral halls and even their family members"".  Mr Chung, however, said he would not give up on his plans to protest.  ""We can't legally attend the protest or invite others to attend,"" he said. ""But I myself will be at Yuen Long and will be there to help if anything bad happens.""  "	ABC (Australia)

Hundreds of students gathered in the university's Great Court on Wednesday to express their views regarding Beijing's policies on Hong Kong, Taiwan and Uyghurs in the far-western region of Xinjiang. It was one of two demonstrations held at the University of Queensland on Wednesday — the first was a sit-in at 10:00am to protest over the suspended extradition bill in Hong Kong. Students say the morning protest was peaceful, with people signing a wall mirroring the ""Lennon Wall"" in Hong Kong where activists have pinned thousands of notes stating their protest demands. But during the afternoon protest, which kicked off at noon, pro-China students clashed with the other group as they played nationalistic songs and reportedly chanted ""China is great"". Videos posted on social media showed shouting and abuse turn into physical violence, and police arriving to break up the four-hour stand off.   Hong Kong student Christy Leung told the ABC she was shocked when a fellow student attacked her as she held a sign explaining the recent Hong Kong protests. ""Suddenly, a tall and strong man kicked my poster away, grabbing my hand with his hand and tore the poster I was holding,"" she said. ""I didn't panic, but I was shocked. ""I was afraid there would be a fight when other boys rushed out to protect me.""   Ms Leung, who is studying hospitality and tourism management at UQ, said after her poster was destroyed, some 200 pro-Beijing demonstrators surrounded her and fellow Hong Kong protesters. ""They drove us to the lawn and surrounded us for half an hour,"" she said. ""We were afraid that something could happen, so we left after they walked away."" Ms Leung said their Lennon Wall was also vandalised with ""offensive remarks"" against the Hong Kong people.   Minghui Zhu, an 18-year-old finance student from mainland China, was among hundreds of students who turned out in support for the pro-Beijing camp. He told the ABC that tensions rose after the morning protest, which he described as a ""calm conversation"" between the two sides. ""It must be someone playing an underhanded game that inflamed and agitated people,"" he said, adding that the presence of non-Chinese protesters was particularly vexing for mainland students. ""Some Anglo-looking students were continuously giving us the finger, and swearing at us with words shaming Chinese people, such as 'go back to China',"" he said.   In a statement on Wednesday, the university said it expected staff and students to ""express their views in a lawful and respectful manner, and in accordance with the policies and values of the university"". Queensland police told the ABC they ""attended and assisted with monitoring the situation and maintaining the peace"", but no arrests were made.   Mr Zhu said while he was ""quite touched"" that Chinese international students ""united to defend their motherland and express their love for our country"", he also felt ""embarrassed and ashamed"" over the scuffle. He added that he did not want the incident to continue because it would make life ""very difficult"" for Chinese students on the campus in the future. Mr Zhu and other Chinese students at UQ are planning to distribute T-shirts with Chinese slogans for free to promote the Chinese culture. But despite hope from both the pro-democracy and pro-Beijing activists for the conflict to end, experts predict there will be more protests over Chinese issues on Australian soil.   Mark Harrison, a senior lecturer in Chinese studies at the University of Tasmania, told AM Wednesday's protests were a worrying sign and ""something that we should expect more of"".  He said there were multiple issues that could raise tensions among the Chinese diaspora in Australia and elsewhere in the world, including the plight of China's Uyghurs in Xinjiang and the status of Taiwan. ""There's a very large Taiwanese community in Australia — much larger than the Hong Kong community — and that will be a real test of the nature of our political life,"" Dr Harrison said.   He told AM students growing up under the Chinese education system are taught to be committed to certain views, and some of them continue to be influenced when they arrive in Australia. ""There's also your very active consulates and organisations that are communicating with student leaders … working actively to monitor and direct student interests and ensure no-one is straying too far,"" he said. ""I feel huge sympathy for [Chinese students in Australia]. ""[Some] students have a very difficult time just being and enjoying life on university campuses because of all of these forces around them."" Mr Zhu said some Chinese student groups at the University of Queensland are currently seeking support from the Chinese consulate and embassy. The United Kingdom's High Commissioner to Australia said she hoped there would not be more displays of tension outside of Hong Kong. ""I think it's regrettable that that incident happened and that is why resolving issues in Hong Kong is important,"" Vicki Treadell said. ""We don't want to see that spill over into other territories."" But for now, Ms Leung said she and her fellow pro-democracy activists would ""continue to fight"" in Australia through demonstrations as long as Hong Kong keeps fighting.

Hong Kong migration agents have seen a jump in sales and enquiries since the protests against a planned extradition bill began nearly two months ago. Australian-registered migration agent John Hu, who runs a consultancy in the Chinese territory, said he had fielded hundreds of calls over the past month from people who were looking to leave the city because of the political unrest and prospect of greater Chinese control. Mr Hu said total sales had surged in June and Australia was the preferred destination of Hong Kong people seeking permanent migration. ""I would say on a monthly basis we have doubled the number of enquiries. We've had about a 30 to 40 per cent increase in actual sales,"" Mr Hu said. ""In the last three to five years we see there is a steady increase in the number of migrants, especially to Australia."" For seven weeks, Hong Kongers have been demonstrating against a draft law which would allow people suspected of a crime to be extradited to the Chinese mainland to face trial. Earlier this month, Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam suspended the bill, but the business community is among those calling for the proposed law to be scrapped altogether.   It has sparked fears of a second exodus from Hong Kong, more than 20 years after the first wave of departures during its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997. Chinese-Australian academic Chongyi Feng, from the University of Technology Sydney, said a second wave of departures was already occurring because of fears China was further cracking down on Hong Kong. ""That is already happening — some of my friends have been doing that,"" Professor Feng said. ""You can see on the news that a lot of businesspeople and professionals are planning to do it.""   The political unrest has hit retail sales and tourism, and some investors are moving their money to places seen as safer havens, such as Singapore. The Hong Kong Retail Management Association (HKRMA) said the value of retail sales dropped in June and the first week of July compared to the same time last year, and it was expecting a double digit fall for 2019. ""The protests have affected the daily life of Hong Kong people and our business environment,"" it said last week. ""HKRMA urges the Government to handle the situation swiftly and to return calmness to the society as soon as possible."" The situation has added to the gloom created by the US-China trade war and high rents which is weighing on the territory's shopkeepers. Luxury goods firms such as watch and jewellery makers Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels have also been affected, and prices for luxury homes have declined. Protesters are targeting companies on social media that they accuse of colluding with Hong Kong authorities, such as property developer Sun Hung Kai Properties and TV station TVB. David Tarsh from travel consultancy ForwardKeys said there was a 5.4 per cent fall in flight bookings from Asian countries such as Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia and India to Hong Kong from the middle of June to the middle of July.   ""What we found was there had been a drop-off in bookings associated with the waves of protests and demonstrations,"" he said. ""Over the period from the 16th of June to the 29th of June — and this was over the period where we saw really big demonstrations — we saw bookings fall 9 per cent.""  However, Mr Tarsh said the impact of the protests on Asian holiday-makers had been limited so far, with bookings rebounding last week by 13.4 per cent and long-haul flights remaining unaffected. There are also predictions the political unrest will deter mainland tourists from visiting Hong Kong. Hong Kong is one of the world's biggest financial centres, with no tariffs, low taxes and an independent legal system, in contrast to communist China's one-party rule. When Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 the promise was ""one country, two systems"", meaning the territory would retain its autonomy for 50 years after the handover. PwC's head of Asia Andrew Parker said investors and business were concerned about being caught up if the extradition law was eventually passed. ""This unrest is unsettling and it's causing people to ask questions about Hong Kong and its future,"" he told The Business. ""Hong Kong is very significant. Australian businesses use Hong Kong as a launch pad into Asia and China as well."" Professor Feng knows all too well the dangers of offending China.   He was one of thousands of Chinese students allowed to stay in Australia after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Two years ago, the Chinese politics professor was detained for more than a week while on a study trip in China. ""Among those who are abducted, I am the luckiest one simply because I happen to know many people in many high places in China,"" Professor Feng said. His former student, writer Yang Hengjun, was not so lucky.   The Australian citizen has been detained in China for six months so far. International pressure on Beijing and the Hong Kong Government is mounting. BlackRock head of Asia-Pacific Geraldine Buckingham said international companies were closely monitoring developments. ""We take a watch-and-wait approach and at this stage we don't see any major implication to the corporate world,"" Ms Buckingham said. However, Beijing is losing patience and there are concerns it could take a more hard-line position towards Hong Kong, including declaring a state of emergency if the protests continue. Professor Feng said Hong Kong's freedoms were at stake. ""Now they want to subject Hong Kong to one-party rule, change all the existing protection of human rights and rule of law in Hong Kong to make Hong Kong a normal Chinese city,"" he warned.

The protest was peaceful for most of the day, but scuffles broke out when police started clearing streets after nightfall. Some protesters retreated into a shopping complex where they and police hit each other with clubs and umbrellas. Footage posted on social media showed both protesters and police violently beating individuals laying on the mall floor. Other footage showed police being bombarded with umbrellas and parents fleeing the area with small children.   Police appeared to arrest some people, but there were no reports as to how many. The violence wound down toward midnight as the remaining protesters left the area. Organisers said 110,000 protesters took part, while police put the number at 28,000, according to broadcaster RTHK. Protesters were demanding an investigation into complaints that police assaulted participants in earlier demonstrations.     Millions have taken to the streets over the past month in some of the largest and most violent protests in decades. The protests began in opposition to a proposed extradition law but have swelled to include complaints about an influx of mainland Chinese into Hong Kong and that Chief Executive Carrie Lam's Government fails to address the needs of its people. Ms Lam's Government suspended action last month on the extradition bill. It would have allowed Hong Kong crime suspects to be transferred to the mainland, where the ruling Communist Party controls the court system. Although Hong Kong's embattled leader has said the extradition bill is ""dead"", opponents said they would settle for nothing short of its formal withdrawal. Ms Lam described protesters in the latest clashes as ""rioters"" and that she supported police upholding the law and seeking those responsible. She made the comments at a hospital where three police officers were being treated for injuries sustained in Saturday's skirmishes.   Ms Lam apologised for her handling of the legislation, but critics are demanding she resign.   ""I think there is now a huge problem on how the police enforce the law,"" said Nelson Yip, a protester in his 40s. ""Carrie Lam has been hiding. She has made many promises, but she has not been able to fulfil them. There is no sign she is going to fulfil them."" In a separate demonstration earlier on Sunday, a group representing Hong Kong journalists marched to Ms Lam's office on Hong Kong Island to highlight complaints that police beat and obstructed reporters at earlier demonstrations. ""It seems that they have deliberately targeted the journalists,"" said Chris Yeung, chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association. Police issued a statement promising better training for officers and communication with reporters. ""There is room for improvement,"" the statement said. It promised ""appropriate follow-up actions"" for complaints of mistreatment. Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that guarantees its people freedoms for 50 years that are not enjoyed in mainland China, including the liberty to protest and an independent judiciary. Beijing denies interfering in Hong Kong affairs, but many residents worry about what they see as an erosion of those freedoms and a relentless march toward mainland control.

The bill, which would have allowed people in Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China to face trial, sparked huge and at times violent street protests and plunged the former British colony into turmoil. Ms Lam said she does not support the bill and was concerned her government may go ahead and forge the law without her. ""I have almost immediately put a stop to the amendment exercise, but there are still lingering doubts about the government's sincerity or worries [about] whether the government will restart the process in the Legislative Council,"" she said. ""So I reiterate here, there is no such plan. The bill is dead."" The move marks a major victory for people power in the city, with many protesters fearing the extradition plan could threaten Hong Kong's separate legal system.   On July 1, the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from Britain, a peaceful march drew hundreds of thousands of people but was overshadowed by an assault on the territory's legislative building. A few hundred demonstrators shattered thick glass panels to enter the building and wreaked havoc for three hours, spray-painting slogans on the chamber walls, overturning furniture and damaging electronic voting and fire prevention systems. Ms Lam said investigations would take place under the Department of Justice ""in accordance with the evidence, the law and also the prosecution code"".   Major protests have brought Hong Kong to a standstill for a month. At its peak more than a million people marched to demand the scrapping of the bill. In mid-June, Beijing-backed Ms Lam responded by suspending the bill, but that move failed to mollify critics, who continued to demonstrate against the bill and call for Ms Lam's resignation.   China called the violence an ""undisguised challenge"" to the ""one country, two systems"" model under which Hong Kong has been ruled for 22 years. In the most recent protest on Sunday, tens of thousands of people chanted ""Free Hong Kong"" with some carrying British colonial-era flags. They said they wanted to carry a peaceful message to people on the mainland, where state-run media have not covered the protests widely, but have focused instead on clashes with police and property damage. ""I fully understand that the responses of the government may not have met the wishes of the people, especially the protesters, who have gone on the streets several times to express their views,"" Ms Lam said. ""I just want to reiterate ... this is nothing to do with my own pride or arrogance,"" she said.   ""This is the government's full deliberation of the various concerns and factors. ""So my sincere plea is, please give us the opportunity, the time, the room, for us to take Hong Kong out of the current impasse and try to improve the current situation."" Hong Kong was returned to China from Britain in 1997. However, it was under the condition that Hong Kong would retain some of its democratic institutions, including its judicial system and independence, for 50 years after the handover, set to expire in 2047.

Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has asked to meet students in the Chinese-ruled city as she tries to fend off pressure after a month of protests over a proposed law that has plunged the Chinese-ruled city into turmoil. Protesters stormed Hong Kong's legislature on Monday, the 22nd anniversary of the former British colony's return to China. This followed mass demonstrations last month against Ms Lam's extradition bill. Beijing-backed Ms Lam has suspended the bill but protesters are demanding a full withdrawal. ""Young people have already done a lot for us. We should at least stand out once for them. I am so distressed for them. Even though they seem a little bit violent ... they didn't hurt anyone,"" Carina Wan, 40, a primary school teacher who took part in the mothers' march, said. ""The ones who hurt us is the government. If they don't release the young people, we will keep standing out."" The organisers estimated that 8,000 mothers had joined the march, while the police put their number at 1,300. In a statement, a spokeswoman for Ms Lam said on Thursday that she had ""recently started inviting young people of different backgrounds for a meeting, including university students and young people who have participated in recent protests"".   The student union at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), one of eight major higher education institutions, turned down the offer, saying Ms Lam had requested a closed-door meeting. ""The dialogue must be open to all Hong Kong citizens to participate, and allow everybody the right to speak,"" the union said in a statement. Ms Lam's spokeswoman said the meeting would be held in a ""small-scale and closed-door manner"" to ensure an ""in-depth and frank exchange of views"". A leader of the Hong Kong University Students' Union, Jordan Pang, said he would only agree if the government promised not to investigate protesters involved in the protests. ""We don't understand why she didn't openly respond to the people's demands but prefer to do it through a closed-door meeting,"" Mr Pang said. ""We want to ask if the government sincerely wants to communicate with young people or if it's just another political PR show."" The Hong Kong Bar Association (HKBA) renewed calls for the government to set up an independent inquiry to look into events on June 12, when police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters, and also on Monday when demonstrators stormed the legislature. ""HKBA calls on the government to respond in a sincere way to the demands of the community voiced so emphatically over the past weeks,"" it said. ""A refusal to engage with the public over important and pressing issues is inimical to the rule of law."" Hong Kong returned to China under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including freedom to protest and a much-cherished independent judiciary. But many resent what they see as increasing meddling by the mainland and the erosion of those freedoms. Beijing denies the charge. Students have echoed opposition calls in recent weeks for the withdrawal of the extradition bill, for Ms Lam to step down and for an investigation into complaints of police brutality. They have also called for Ms Lam to stop labelling protesters ""rioters"" and to introduce genuine universal suffrage. Students at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, another of the city's eight higher education institutions, were also invited to meet Ms Lam but had not decided how to respond, a source at the student union there said.

Beijing denounced British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt as ""shameless"" and said it had made a diplomatic complaint to London after he warned of consequences if China neglected its commitments to guarantee basic freedoms.   ""In the minds of some people, they regard Hong Kong as still under British rule. They forget … that Hong Kong has now returned to the embrace of the Motherland,"" China's ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, said. ""I tell them: hands off Hong Kong and show respect. This colonial mindset is still haunting the minds of some officials or politicians,"" Mr Liu told reporters The growing war of words between China and Britain follows mass protests in Hong Kong against a now suspended bill that would allow extradition to mainland China. Hundreds of protesters in the former British colony besieged and broke into the legislature on Monday after a demonstration marking the anniversary of return to Chinese rule. Hong Kong police said they had arrested 11 men and one woman who were involved. They face various charges including possession of offensive weapons, unlawful assembly, assaulting a police officer, obstructing a police officer and failing to carry an identity document, police said. The brief statement did not describe the offensive weapons or provide further details. China called the violence an ""undisguised challenge"" to the ""one country, two systems"" model under which Hong Kong has been ruled for 22 years.   On Tuesday, Mr Hunt warned of consequences if China did not abide by the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984 on the terms of the return of Hong Kong, which allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including the right to protest.   ""We can make it clear we stand behind the people of Hong Kong in defence of the freedoms that we negotiated for them when we agreed to the handover in 1997 and we can remind everyone that we expect all countries to honour their international obligations,"" Mr Hunt told Reuters. Mr Hunt is one of two contenders vying to replace Theresa May as British prime minister and his rival Boris Johnson told Reuters that he also backed the people of Hong Kong ""every inch of the way"". China's London envoy scolded Britain and said meddling in Hong Kong would cause a ""problem in the relationship"" between them. ""The UK government chose to stand on the wrong side: it has made inappropriate remarks not only to interfere in internal affairs of Hong Kong but also to back up the violent law-breakers,"" Mr Liu said.   Britain had summoned Mr Liu to the foreign office following his ""unacceptable"" comments, a Government source said.   ""Message to Chinese govt: good relations between countries are based on mutual respect and honouring the legally binding agreements between them,"" Mr Hunt said on Twitter after Mr Liu's media briefing. ""That is the best way to preserve the great relationship between the UK and China."" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang also chided Mr Hunt, saying that only after Hong Kong's return to China did its people get an ""unprecedented"" guarantee about democracy and freedom. ""To say that the freedoms of Hong Kong residents is something Britain strived for is simply shameless,"" he told a news briefing. ""I would like to ask Mr Hunt, during the British colonial era in Hong Kong, was there any democracy to speak of? Hongkongers didn't even have the right to protest.""   The turbulence in Hong Kong was triggered by an extradition bill opponents said would undermine Hong Kong's much-cherished rule of law and give Beijing powers to prosecute activists in mainland courts, which are controlled by the Communist Party. Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam had strongly promoted the bill, but suspended it on June 15 in the face of public protests against it. Critics have called on her to officially kill the bill, but she has resisted.   Britain and China had been seeking to reset ties after a row over the disputed South China Sea last year, with Chinese Vice-Premier Hu Chunhua visiting London last month to oversee the start of a link between its stock exchange and that of Shanghai. Confrontation and lawlessness in Hong Kong could damage its reputation as an international business hub and seriously hurt its economy, China's state-owned newspaper, the People's Daily, said in an editorial. ""It will not only serve no purpose, but will also severely hinder economic and social development,"" the paper said, denouncing what it called artificially created division and opposition. China has blamed Western countries, particularly the United States and Britain, for offering succour to the protests. Reuters/AP"	ABC (Australia)

Radical protesters smashed into the city's parliament building, vandalised the premises and briefly took over the chamber for the first time in history.   It was the third major protest in a month, triggered by a controversial extradition bill. But this protest struck a qualitatively different note from the previous two, held on June 9 and 16. The earlier protests were marked by peaceful rallies with people humming ""Hallelujah to the Lord"". This time, a corner has been turned. We are now witnessing a situation that has every possibility of escalating out of control.   The road ahead for Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, is paradoxical, to put it mildly. As tempting as resignation might appear to her on a personal level right now, it's simply not possible.  The decision to resign lies well outside the scope of Ms Lam's political choices and is a decision Beijing alone can make. The image of Carrie Lam admitting she's ""outraged and distressed"" at a press conference she called inside police headquarters, at the unbelievable hour of 4:00am on July 2, makes it abundantly clear that she is both politically and temperamentally unfit for governing Hong Kong in the post Occupy Central era. The rapid descent into chaos in a city known for order could have been avoided were she less ""arrogant"" — the favourite adjective Hong Kong's local press has adopted to describe her. That covers a whole range of political incompetence from gross underestimation of public distrust of the central Government in Beijing, to stubborn aversion to simply having a dialogue with the opposition lawmakers, let alone young activists. Beijing must have been watching developments in Hong Kong over the past few weeks with horror and disbelief. The final judgement on the Lam administration's ability to govern came last night. The oddly inefficient behaviour of the Hong Kong police, once touted Asia's finest, would appear to be the final nail in the coffin for Ms Lam's team.   Riot police stood by inside the legislature building throughout the day, without intervention, while the crowd continued its rampage outside. Criticism of ""police brutality"" during the June 12 clashes with protesters clearly influenced their actions. But in the eyes of Beijing's hardliners this reaction reads as not being equipped to handle a crisis situation. In crude terms: if the one million-strong protest on June 9 marked the moment Ms Lam completely lost the public support of Hong Kong citizens, the two million-strong rally on June 16 was the day  after Ms Lam sold her proposal on indefinitely suspending the extradition bill as sufficient to pacify the situation at a reported meeting across the border in Shenzhen with the Chinese Communist Party's top Hong Kong affairs official. It hit home in the Beijing leadership that they had chosen the wrong person for Hong Kong's top office. This week's violence on the July 1 has signalled the moment when Beijing decides Carrie Lam and her team have lost control of Hong Kong. It would not be surprising if Beijing has already started to think about a Plan B. But it is also not surprising that Beijing has not yet publicly disowned Ms Lam. A move like that would appear as caving in to protesters, and set a dangerous precedence for which Chinese leader Xi Jinping has no appetite.   And with no obvious successor in sight (Ms Lam's number two, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, is also widely unpopular), a quick and forced change of administration in Hong Kong would only destabilise the situation further and displease stability-obsessed, authoritarian leaders in Beijing. In the short term, Lam is here to stay. Instead, while plotting a sustainable succession plan and ensuring the situation doesn't deteriorate further, Beijing is happy to allow Ms Lam to continue shouldering the burden of public blame. So far, there has been little direct Chinese Government intervention in the street protests in Hong Kong. Beijing has given verbal support to the Lam Government and that's about it.   This rather restrained approach is likely to continue as Beijing faces more urgent external pressures, particularly in its relationship with the United States.  The last thing Beijing wants now is for Hong Kong's status as one of Asia's premier financial hubs undermined in the middle of its possibly thawing trade tensions with the US.    The next few weeks will be crucial for Ms Lam. Her promise to ""heal the society"" is near impossible thanks to her lack of political acumen. Instead, Ms Lam's task now is to minimise further damage and prevent Hong Kong from descending into lawlessness. To that end, she'll have Beijing's backing.  Without her making concessions, the situation in Hong Kong will not gradually ""return to normal"" as many moderate citizens expect. Ms Lam has already apologised several times. But most in Hong Kong are sceptical of her remorse which they view as ""empty promises"". In fact, Lam's political weakness has led to protesters upgrading their demands which now include something practically impossible: dismissing the Legislative Council (LegCo) with an executive order and at once carry out universal suffrage for both the LegCo and the Chief Executive elections. Had she agreed to completely shelve the extradition bill that's already technically dead, the demands would be easier to handle. Now, the protesters' other demands, setting up an independent investigation committee on the June 12 clashes and having a dialogue with young activists, might appear offensive to Lam's political palate.  They are still low-hanging fruit in her effort to normalise the situation.   Of course, Ms Lam and Beijing, might be harbouring the hope that public opinion will turn around, just like they did in the later stages of the 79-day 2014 Occupy protests. But it is safe to say that the violent demonstrations on July 1 are harmful to the protesters' larger cause, which will need broader public support.

Protesters whacked away at thick glass windows until they shattered and then pried open steel security gates.  The three-hour occupation of the Legislative Council ended after police began firing tear gas shortly after midnight. About a thousand protesters, furious at a proposed law allowing extraditions to China, were gathered around the building in the former British colony's financial district in a direct challenge to authorities in Beijing.   The day after the protest, a representative of China's Hong Kong affairs office labelled the actions of some protesters an ""undisguised challenge"" to the one country, two systems formula.  Pro-Beijing politicians in Hong Kong also condemned the damage done by the protesters.  Regina Ip, a former security secretary in the semi-autonomous territory, said such behaviour was not acceptable in ""civilized society"". She said there was nothing that could justify ""the sort of violence we saw"". Protesters held up umbrellas to protect themselves or fled, while plumes of smoke billowed across major thoroughfares and between skyscrapers. Officers eventually entered the legislative chambers after protesters had already left. It was not clear if any arrests were made. Most demonstrators had been cleared by the early hours of Tuesday morning after some of the most violent protests to rock the city in decades.   Umbrellas, metal barriers, hard hats, water bottles and other debris lay strewn across major roads. Protesters had carried road signs, corrugated iron sheets and pieces of scaffolding as they barged into the council building. Some sat at legislators' desks, checking their phones, while others scrawled ""anti-extradition"" on chamber walls.   Other graffiti called for Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to step down, while pictures of some politicians were defaced. Banners hanging over flyovers at the protest site read: ""Free Hong Kong.""   A small group of mostly students wearing hard hats and masks had used a metal trolley, poles and scaffolding to smash their way through the legislative compound's reinforced glass doors.   The protesters, some with cling film wrapped around their arms to protect them from tear gas, also paralysed parts of the Asian financial hub as they occupied roads after blocking them off with metal barriers. The Government called for an immediate end to the violence, saying it had stopped work on amendments to the suspended extradition bill and that the legislation would automatically lapse in July next year. The Legislative Council Secretariat released a statement cancelling business for today, as did the central government offices, which said they would close ""owing to security consideration"". Ms Lam called a 4:00am press conference the morning after the chaos, where she condemned the ""violence"" and ""vandalism"" of protesters who stormed the territory's legislature. ""This is something we should seriously condemn,"" she said. Ms Lam also said police, who initially retreated as protesters entered the parliament building, had exercised restraint in dealing with the demonstrations.   Ms Lam suspended the extradition bill on June 15 but stopped short of protesters' demands to scrap it.   It was not immediately clear if the announcement would eventually ease the tension. The Beijing-backed leader is clinging to her job amid an unprecedented backlash against the Government. Opponents of the extradition bill, which would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party, fear it is a threat to Hong Kong's much-cherished rule of law. The wave of discontent poses the greatest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. Hong Kong returned to China under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including freedom to protest and an independent judiciary. Beijing denies interfering but, for many Hong Kong residents, the extradition bill is the latest step in a relentless march towards mainland control.   China has been angered by criticism from Western capitals, including Washington and London, about the legislation. Beijing said on Monday that Britain had no responsibility for Hong Kong any more and was opposed to its ""gesticulating"" about the territory. The European Union on Monday called for restraint and dialogue to find a way forward.   Monday's protests began with tens of thousands of people marching in temperatures of around 33 degrees Celsius from Victoria Park in an annual rally. Organisers said 550,000 turned out but police said there were 190,000 at their peak. More than a million people have taken to the streets at times over the past three weeks to vent their anger. Ms Lam contrasted the earlier demonstration with the storming of the legislature, saying the two protests had shown ""two entirely different public scenes"". Pro-democracy politicians and the protest organiser said Ms Lam has ignored the demands of the people and pushed youngsters towards desperation, despite pledging to listen to people's demands.

Taiwan's Golden Melody Awards, which were livestreamed to millions of people across Asia on Saturday, was censored on Chinese live-streaming sites when presenter Jen Chiang-da said: ""Hong Kong, add oil!"" The phrase ""add oil"" was added to the Oxford Dictionary last year and is used to express encouragement or support.  The comment appeared to spur on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, where organisers estimated up to 2 million people took to the streets to protest against a much-maligned extradition bill.  Mr Jen's speech ventured further into political territory, tackling not just protests in Hong Kong but also the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.   Mr Jen, the founder of independent label Crystal Records, made the comments as he was presenting an award for ""special contribution"" to the Blacklist Studio, a group of Taiwanese musicians who released a pro-democracy-themed album called Songs of Madness in 1989. ""In 1989, the Berlin Wall collapsed, the June 4 Tiananmen Square incident [happened], Cheng Nan-jung sacrificed himself for democracy, and the Blacklist Studio released the Songs of Madness,"" he said.    ""It was the year when the world was making an effort to move towards a new order of having more freedom and democracy. ""However, the authority of this land was still the same, and the authorities abused power."" He said while freedom of speech and democracy was under threat in Taiwan during martial law, ""the Blacklist Studio wasn't afraid of that trend"". ""The Songs of Madness subverted the conservative history of the Government's decree on the music industry, and opened a new era of independence and autonomy for our pop music,"" he said.    It is not the first time awards ceremonies have been censored in China for broadcasting ideas contrary to the Chinese Communist Party line.  The Golden Horse Awards, known as the ""Chinese Oscars"", got political when documentary filmmaker Fu Yue used her acceptance speech to voice her hopes for Taiwan's independence.  ""I hope one day our country will be recognised and treated as a truly independent entity,"" Ms Fu said in her speech in November last year, before she was cut off by Chinese censors.   The Blacklist Studio had planned a protest of its own, though not of an anti-Chinese flavour. A group unfurled a banner that read: ""I am in Asia. I am anti-American imperialism"".  Although they were pro-democracy, they shared China's vision of the United States, Jason Wu, founder of Taiwanese think-tank GoldenRock, said.  Mr Wu said there was a trend of celebrities using their platform during live-stream events to evade the censors and pack a political punch.    ""Artists speaking out in live events are more widely seen in Taiwan now, because [China] seriously interferes with Taiwanese media … [so] they would try to use any occasion to attempt to speak out,"" he said.  Taiwan has been closely watching the protests in Hong Kong, where opponents to the extradition bill fear dissidents could be swept off to China to face trial on trumped-up charges.  In mid-June, Taipei hosted an estimated 10,000-strong demonstration in solidarity with Hong Kong and to call out Chinese interference in Taiwan's politics and media. The majority of Taiwanese citizens harbour deep distrust of the ""one country, two systems"" model that exists in Hong Kong.  A May survey by the Mainland Affairs Council found 83 per cent of respondents had no faith in ""one country, two systems"".  ""It is widely seen as a joke in Taiwan because even people who are pro-China are also very confused about it,"" Mr Wu said.  ""Both the Government and the public have a very negative impression, where we have seen Hong Kong as a real-life example.""

Police appeared to back-off as the protesters came in to avoid confrontation. Pro-government politicians have complained of radical, violent elements undermining social order.  The protesters said the Hong Kong government is not responding to their demands for a full withdrawal of contentious extradition legislation and the resignation of city leader Carrie Lam. The renewed chaos in the Asian financial hub came after police and protesters faced off earlier in the day.   Police used pepper spray and batons against anti-government protesters who had seized highways ahead of what was expected to be a huge pro-democracy rally on the anniversary of the city's handover to China. The semi-autonomous city has been shaken by huge demonstrations in the past three weeks as protesters demanded the withdrawal of a bill that would allow extraditions to the Chinese mainland. Tensions spiked once more in the financial hub as dawn broke on Monday after thousands of mainly young, masked protesters seized three key thoroughfares, deploying metal and plastic barriers to block the roads. Shortly before a flag-raising ceremony to mark the handover, police swooped on protesters who had blockaded one street, with at least one female protester seen bleeding from a head wound after the clashes. The ongoing rallies are the latest manifestation of growing fears that China is stamping down on the city's freedoms and culture with the help of the financial hub's pro-Beijing leaders.   The British returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, but it is still administered separately under an arrangement known as ""one country, two systems"". Many residents fear Beijing is already reneging on that deal. Pro-democracy activists have organised a march every handover anniversary, calling for greater democratic freedoms, such as the right to elect the city's leader. They've mustered large crowds in recent years — including a two-month occupation in 2014 — but failed to win any concessions from Beijing.   This year's rally comes against the backdrop of unprecedented anti-government protests over the past three weeks that have drawn millions of people and anger over police using tear gas and rubber bullets to clear crowds.   The spark for the current wave of protests was an attempt by chief executive Carrie Lam to pass the Beijing-backed extradition law, which she has now postponed following the huge public backlash. But the demonstrations have morphed into a wider movement against Ms Lam's administration and Beijing, posing the greatest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. A tired-looking Ms Lam appeared in public for the first time in nearly two weeks to attend the anniversary ceremony, flanked by her husband and former Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa.  Authorities deployed a huge security blanket around the venue, with the ceremony moved inside shortly before it was due to begin. Ms Lam said the government needed to change its style of governance to be more accommodating and open and pledged to do more for young people.   ""I, as a politician, have to remind myself all the time of the need to grasp public sentiments accurately,"" she said. ""After this incident, I will learn the lesson and ensure that the Government's future work will be closer and more responsive to the aspirations, sentiments and opinions of the community."" The turmoil comes at a delicate time for Beijing, which is grappling with a trade dispute with the United States, a faltering economy and tensions in the South China Sea.

That isn't to say other countries don't matter — Germany and Japan are still big advanced economies, India is growing strongly. A middle power like Australia carries influence particularly in the Asia Pacific region as it straddles the divide between the superpowers.  But it is the Washington-Beijing relationship that will define our times and right now it is a deep inflection point. Some would suggest a crisis point. The two biggest economies in the world are locked in an escalating trade war: a game to see who blinks first. Critical are the two leaders: Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. They have boasted of their close relationship before, yet it isn't enough yet to get a deal on trade. The Financial Times this week described the mood as ""toxic"" and says ""trust has all but collapsed"". Perhaps the two leaders share too much in common. They both put their countries first and speak of a return to greatness.    Both countries ignore the World Trade Organisation when it suits.  Mr Trump has shown he wants to shake up the American-led global order, from questioning the future of NATO, to imposing trade tariffs on allies and economic partners on his way to the G20 summit, and criticising the host nation Japan for not pulling its weight in the US defence alliance. If America went to war, he said, the Japanese would ""watch it on Sony television"" rather than join the fight. China is building its own network of influence, the Belt and Road initiative — $US1 trillion of infrastructure and investment covering more than 60 countries and 40 per cent of global GDP — and its Asia Infrastructure and Investment Bank. It has claimed and militarised disputed islands in the South China Sea, ignoring a ruling of the Maritime Court in The Hague.  As the two giants battle over trade, there are rising fears of a more deadly conflict.    Analysts warn of the ""Thucydides Trap"" — a supposed iron law of geopolitics dating back to the ancient wars of Sparta and Athens that a rising power and a waning power inevitably meet on the battlefield.  Unlikely? Well, as International Affairs expert, Christopher Coker, points out on his book The Improbable War, logic tells powerful nations ""if you want peace, prepare for war"". Coker says war can be avoided but warns if it does break out it will likely be within the next decade. It depends, he says, on how the two powers play out this rivalry. US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, this month told European leaders ""China wants to be the dominant economic and military power of the world, spreading its authoritarian vision for society and its corrupt practices worldwide."" The most recent US National Security Strategy makes it clear that the world is again in an era of great power rivalry. Russia and China are named as the greatest threats — more than international terrorism — nations that ""want to shape a world antithetical to US values and interests."" This a clash of values.    Observers now talk about a clash of civilisation and ideology. There is little doubt that's how Mr Xi sees the world. He is hailed as the most powerful Chinese leader since the revolutionary figure, Mao Zedong. He has changed the constitutional presidential term limits, meaning he is potentially the leader for life. Mr Xi is a Maoist, whose China Dream is to return his nation to global power. For Mr Xi, the Communist Party is central to everything in China. He talks of a ""harmonious society"", yet he seeks to impose it by force, silencing dissent, cracking down on freedom of expression and jailing rivals.  He has targeted the Muslim Uighur majority, holding a million of them in ""re-education camps"", where human rights activists say they are brainwashed to declare allegiance to the state. Mr Xi speaks of fighting the ""long game"". He uses phrases like ""sacrifice"" and ""blood"". He warns of outside threats and of outsmarting capitalism. He rejects liberal democracy and has told his party leadership to prepare for a long period of conflict. For all that, he is vulnerable. The marching of millions in Hong Kong has unnerved Beijing. Mr Xi rules over what China-watcher Susan Shirk has called a ""fragile superpower"". The Communist Party fears its own people: it spends more on internal security than defence.   As Mr Xi sees himself as a self-styled champion of a new global order with his brand of authoritarian capitalism on the march against retreating democracy, he also knows there are many stumbling blocks to the return of China. The United States still dwarfs China in purely economic and military terms. It has global alliances where China has only transactions.  Every few years there is another book predicting China's collapse — mostly overblown and certainly premature — yet the latest is one of the more persuasive. George Magnus from Oxford University, in his book Red Flags: Why Xi's China is in Jeopardy, warns of the ""Four Traps: the debt trap, the currency trap, the ageing trap and the middle-income trap"".    They are self-explanatory: China has rapidly taken on debt; its currency cannot forever be pegged to the US dollar and a floating renminbi could be perilous for the economy; it is the fastest ageing country in the world, losing workforce and putting strain on government resources; and no authoritarian regime has ever made the transition to a fully fledged middle-income country. Magnus says the Chinese President knows what he is up against.  Mr Xi, addressing the Party Congress in 2017, warned the economy was ""unbalanced and inadequate"". It is a warning Chinese leaders have been issuing for more than a decade. Mr Xi believes he can defy history by doubling down on the power of the party and making good on the deal with the Chinese people: we will make you rich, not free. This is a high stakes game, the trade war with the US is just one — albeit large — factor.  Mr Trump and Mr Xi may yet strike a grand bargain, but a full reckoning of this critical relationship lies in the future. Scott Morrison says the global power tussle means the world needs ""urgent repair"" of the rules-based system, and Trade Minister, Simon Birmingham — channelling Spider-Man — says great power comes with great responsibilities.  For Mr Xi and Mr Trump, responsibility begins at home, and both seem determined to write the rules to suit themselves.  Stan Grant is the ABC's global affairs analyst."	ABC (Australia)

ABC News: Brant Cumming Being a China correspondent, I don't cover many protests.  If I do, they're often very small and on the verge of being shutdown by police as soon as I arrive.  Share The biggest protest drew almost two million people onto the streets. ABC News: Bill Birtles Which made the incredible scenes on the streets of Hong Kong in recent weeks all the more extraordinary for me. Hong Kong is a city being squeezed. Although it's been under Communist Party control since the British handover in 1997, the 50-year 'One Country, Two Systems' deal the UK negotiated means Hong Kong is far and away the most liberal city under Communist Party control.  But little by little, Beijing has been deliberately chipping away at that.  Recent laws jailing people who mock the national anthem or insult the flag are examples of the new curbs Beijing is imposing on free speech.  The jailing of pro-democracy activists and legislators by Hong Kong courts on a whole range of charges has sent a chill through the city.  Little wonder the prospect of an extradition agreement with mainland China has spooked a wide cross section of Hong Kong society.  Few people in the city believe Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, when she promises there will be safeguards to prevent political activists being targeted.  But the scale of the anger took many by surprise.  Space to play or pause, M to mute, left and right arrows to seek, up and down arrows for volume. An initial protest drew up to one million people. I wasn't there for that, as I was finishing up a Foreign Correspondent in Taiwan, so the ABC arranged to fly in the new South-East Asia correspondent Kathryn Diss from Australia and Beijing cameraman Steve Wang. For a couple of days they covered what many described as the biggest protest the city had seen since the handover, and though mainly peaceful, things turned ugly late at night with protestors and police clashing.  With the story seemingly over after that, the ABC team wrapped up and left, only for student activists to then call a snap protest a few days later.  Steve and I scrambled to get down there but we hit a snag.  As a Chinese national, Steve can't fly into Hong Kong with the ease that I can despite it being a part of his country.  He needs a Hong Kong pass, which limits the number of visits and duration of stay for mainlanders — a measure to control migration flows. And just hours before we were due to depart, police in Beijing told our cameraman there was a ""problem"" in the system with his pass, meaning they couldn't imminently approve another trip for him to travel to Hong Kong. Lucky the Beijing bureau has two cameramen! At very short notice we called in Brant Cumming, got the gear and caught a flight, arriving to witness hundreds of Christian protestors gathered on a balmy night outside the parliament building singing 'Sing Hallelujah to the Lord'.  Space to play or pause, M to mute, left and right arrows to seek, up and down arrows for volume. That was the calm before the storm. The following day tens of thousands of students amassed in central Hong Kong, blocking roads and threatening to try to occupy the local parliament.  By late afternoon riot police were moving in with tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets.  Young protestors were coughing and spluttering, running in panic and getting increasingly agitated during hours of back and forth clashes with police.  I'd never before felt the lingering sting of pepper spray on my skin nor the constant wafting of tear gas. The generosity of the young protestors was extraordinary — they raced up and handed us water bottles, extra masks, umbrellas and muesli bars.  They did this for everyone, there was a spirit of camaraderie amongst them and a desire to help foreign news crews covering their movement.  The story had become huge and this was that moment in history when the people of Hong Kong were saying 'enough' to pressure from Beijing.  Share Birtles covering the protests, filmed by cameraman Craig Berkman. ABC News But we had another problem.  Brant was due to fly to London to fill a gap in the Europe bureau, and, with Steve blocked from flying in, the ABC sent Brisbane-based cameraman Craig Berkman and reporter Nick Dole from Sydney for back up.  For several days the protests seem to peter out and we wondered if we'd overdone it.  But a massive turn-out of almost two million people a few days later proved it was worth the personnel and effort.  I'd never seen so many people in one place, all dressed in black to express the ""darkness"" they believe the extradition bill would bring to Hong Kong. It was a peaceful march of young, old and families, all passionate about their city and the freedoms they value. It was a mass display of people power — and it worked.  Hong Kong's government backed down, announcing an indefinite delay to the extradition bill and an apology for how it was all handled.  Nothing was going to top that volume of people on the streets, and we afterwards wrapped up and went back to our respective cities.  But this isn't over, with protestors planning more action to demand the complete scrapping of the bill and the resignation of the chief executive.  In the bigger picture this is just one battle in a much larger fight to defend their values against the increasing creep of authoritarianism.  As China rises, it's a story relevant not just to Hong Kong and Taiwan, but to all of Asia.  And it's a story the ABC will be there to cover again. Listen to Bill Birtles report and stories from other ABC foreign correspondents on Correspondents Report on RN's Sunday Extra from 7am or on ABC Listen. As parts of Australia face up to 90 days of lockdowns, you might be feeling like there's no light at the end of the tunnel. But the world has been here before.

However, the struggle to preserve the status quo that Beijing promised at the handover of the former British colony, is set to continue. The monumental protest on June 16 — which drew about two million people to the streets, according to the organisers — took place despite the bill's infinite suspension being announced the day before. The equivalent of one member of every household in this city of seven million people took to the streets.  Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam had to issue a public apology for her administration's deficiencies. It was a noticeable shift from her expression of ""sorrow and regret"" less than 24 hours earlier.  The rapid cave-in by Ms Lam's Government served as proof that people power still works in China's ""special administrative region"" (SAR).   This is much to the relief of the disillusioned many after a pre-democracy Occupy Central movement was suppressed by the Hong Kong government five years ago.  One former student leader confessed, ""I'm most afraid Hong Kong people will not care anymore"".  The protests in the past two weeks, ""Occupy 2.0"" as billed by local press, was more than a mere revival of Occupy activism.  It's the most definitive sign yet that street protest has become special modus operandi for Hong Kong people to fight for their civil rights and extract political concession. Political activism is now woven into the social fabric of a way of life long known to prize utilitarian values. Cyclical protests can be expected whenever coercion is felt. This will make Hong Kong SAR even more wayward in the eyes of the Communist Party leadership in Beijing.  If the central Government hasn't vented any overt anger over mass protests in the street, it's because top leader Xi Jinping has got too much going on right now.  He was in Central Asia seeking to shore up regional security framework when Hong Kong streets were boiling, and is heading for Pyongyang tomorrow for his first state visit to North Korea, before a head-to-head, high-stakes trade talk with Donald Trump later this month in Japan.    The distraction of the Hong Kong protests couldn't have happened at a worse time. The leadership in Beijing would not want to simultaneously handle ""enemy within"" and ""enemy without"". So far, Beijing has focused its anger on unspecified ""foreign forces"" allegedly inflaming tensions on the street.  Overall, Beijing's response has been eerily standard.  The authorities in charge of Hong Kong affairs voiced ""support, understanding and respect"" for the Lam administration's widely criticised handling of the crisis.  But that can't be taken too literally.  It likely only shows Beijing is buying time to think up better strategy.  Beijing also ""firmly supported"" her predecessor Chun-ying Leung's hardline approach on Occupy protestors at the time, before eventually nudging him out of a second term. It's also easier to compartmentalise this time than five years ago.   The Occupy Central centred around Hong Kong's electoral reforms, something more consequential than the extradition bill, which would provide greater technical support for Beijing's governing over Hong Kong. China's ambassador to the UK told the BBC last week that Beijing never initiated the bill. And it's not unlikely an eager-to-deliver Ms Lam took the initiative to put forth the bill in February. There were unconfirmed reports that she met with the Communist Party's top official on Hong Kong and Macau affairs shortly before her Saturday concession. But the central Government hasn't adopted some key phrases used by the Hong Kong Government, such as labelling the protestors as ""rioters"".  The mainland officials opted for ""violent behaviour"" or even ""social reaction"". Ms Lam may be safe for now, but there is little doubt Beijing is having a new assessment of her capabilities. Whatever political capital she has gained by acting as a good ""parental"" leader has been lost. The successful landing of Hong Kong on the front page of international press for all the wrong reasons was no laughing matter for Beijing's leadership as it faced an intensifying geopolitical rivalry with Washington. It is suggested Mr Trump might play the Hong Kong card in the fraught trade negotiation. Also, the controversy over the extradition bill served as an acute reminder of China's flawed judicial systems. This is not something Beijing would like to share when it's trying to make more friends. This is incompetence on a scale that's hard to overlook.   Inside Hong Kong, trust is completely broken between the Lam Government and its citizens.  Protestors are still demanding her resignation. Her lack of political judgement, such as only allowing a 20-day consultation on such a critical bill, makes her unfit to govern a people whose sense of political participation is only growing. Beijing must also be reflecting on why they always pick the wrong person to lead Hong Kong.  It doesn't take a political scientist to figure that out.  An authoritarian regime could only pick a paternalistic leader, which is fundamentally at odds with a Hong Kong population whose political awakening five years ago has now firmly taken root.

Joshua Wong's release from the Lai Chi Kok Correctional Facility came as student demonstrators and police continued to face off in downtown Hong Kong following a massive protest on Sunday. Organisers said almost 2 million people turned out to demand that Ms Lam step down, in what is becoming the most significant challenge to China's relationship with the territory since it was handed back by Britain 22 years ago.   Mr Wong, 22, served nearly five weeks of a two-month sentence for contempt related to his involvement in the 2014 protests, which advocated for more democratic elections. His sentence was reduced from three months because he was only a teenager when he was arrested in 2014. It is unclear why he was released early.   In February, the young activist won an appeal against a separate conviction and six-month sentence for unlawful assembly and was released after spending more than two months in prison in that case, before being sent back to prison in May. He vowed to join the latest round of protests, calling the extradition law ""evil"". ""I believe this is the time for her, Carrie Lam the liar, to step down,"" he told waiting journalists. Mr Wong said he needed a bit of time but that ""no matter what happens, I will join the protest soon"".   The mostly young demonstrators still gathered near the city's government headquarters began moving off the streets on Monday morning after hours of haggling with police.  They were streaming into an outdoor space near the city's legislative chamber that had been closed earlier in the day, allowing police to reopen roads that had been blocked since Sunday's protest. The latest protests were set off by an extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trials.  Ms Lam has suspended that legislation, but activists who saw it as undermining legal rights and judicial independence want it scrapped altogether.   She apologised on Sunday over her plans to push through the extradition bill, but Hong Kong opposition politicians continued to call for Ms Lam's resignation. ""Her government cannot be an effective government, and will have much, much, much difficulties to carry on,"" veteran Democratic Party legislator James To told government-funded broadcaster RTHK. ""I believe the Central People's Government will accept her resignation."" However, the official state newspaper China Daily said Beijing's leaders would continue to back Ms Lam, lashing out at foreign ""meddling"" in the crisis. China's support for Ms Lam will ""not waver, not in the face of street violence nor the ill-intentioned interventions of foreign governments,"" the newspaper said in an editorial.

Protest organisers are hoping more than a million people turn up for Sunday's rally, a similar number they estimated for a demonstration against the proposed extradition bill last Sunday.  Police put that count at 240,000.   Activists set up gazebos as protesters, some carrying flowers, started to gather in sweltering summer heat to march from Victoria Park to Hong Kong's central government offices. Beijing-backed Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Saturday indefinitely delayed the extradition bill that could send people to mainland China to face trial, expressing ""deep sorrow and regret"". The about-face was one of the most significant political turnarounds by the Hong Kong government since Britain returned the territory to China in 1997, and it threw into question Ms Lam's ability to continue to lead the city. Pressure was mounting on Ms Lam after the mass demonstrations.  ""Her government cannot be an effective government, and will have much, much, much difficulties to carry on,"" veteran Democratic Party legislator James To told government-funded broadcaster RTHK. ""I believe the central people's government will accept her resignation.""   Activist investor David Webb, in a newsletter on Sunday, said if Ms Lam was a stock he would recommend shorting her with a target price of zero. ""Call it the Carrie trade. She has irrevocably lost the public's trust,"" Mr Webb said. ""Her minders in Beijing, while expressing public support for now, have clearly lined her up for the chop by distancing themselves from the proposal in recent days.""   Violent clashes on Wednesday, when police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters near the heart of the financial centre, grabbed global headlines and forced some banks to shut branches. Some Hong Kong tycoons have started moving personal wealth offshore over concerns about the proposed extradition law, which critics warn could erode the city's international status. After daybreak on Monday, police announced that they wanted to clear the streets of protesters and lined up several officers deep and to face off against several hundred demonstrators on a street in central Hong Kong.  The police asked for cooperation in clearing the road. Protesters replied with chants, some kneeling in front of the officers.   The city's independent legal system was guaranteed under laws governing Hong Kong's return from British to Chinese rule 22 years ago, and is seen by business and diplomatic communities as its strong remaining asset amid encroachments from Beijing. Hong Kong has been governed under a ""one country, two systems"" formula since its return to Beijing, allowing freedoms not enjoyed on mainland China but not a fully democratic vote.   Many accuse Beijing of extensive meddling since then, including obstruction of democratic reforms, interference with elections and of being behind the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers, starting in 2015, who specialised in works critical of Chinese leaders. Some opponents of the extradition bill said a suspension was not enough, arguing it should be scrapped and Ms Lam should go. ""If she refuses to scrap this controversial bill altogether, it would mean we wouldn't retreat. She stays on, we stay on,"" said pro-democracy politician Claudia Mo. Asked repeatedly on Saturday if she would step down, Ms Lam avoided answering directly and appealed to the public to ""give us another chance"".    Ms Lam said she had been a civil servant for decades and still had work she wanted to do. She added she felt ""deep sorrow and regret that the deficiencies in our work and various other factors have stirred up substantial controversies and disputes in society"".   Meanwhile, Ms Lam's reversal on the bill was hailed by business groups and overseas governments. The UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Twitter: ""Well done HK Government for heeding concerns of the brave citizens who have stood up for their human rights."" ""AmCham is relieved by the government decision to suspend the extradition bill and that it listened to the Hong Kong people and international business community,"" Tara Joseph, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, said.   China's top newspaper on Sunday condemned ""anti-China lackeys"" of foreign forces in Hong Kong. ""Certain people in Hong Kong have been relying on foreigners or relying on young people to build themselves up, serving as the pawns and lackeys of foreign anti-China forces,"" the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily said in a commentary.   ""This is resolutely opposed by the whole of the Chinese people including the vast majority of Hong Kong compatriots."" The Hong Kong protests have been the largest in the city since crowds came out against the bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations centred around Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.   Officials said 72 people were admitted to hospitals during Wednesday protest, while a man died on Saturday after plunging from construction scaffolding where he unfurled a banner denouncing Hong Kong's extradition bill, local media reported. Ms Lam had said the extradition law was necessary to prevent criminals using Hong Kong as a place to hide and that human rights would be protected by the city's court which would decide on the extraditions on a case-by-case basis. Critics, including leading lawyers and rights groups, note China's justice system is controlled by the Communist Party, and say it is marked by torture and forced confessions, arbitrary detention and poor access to lawyers.

Government offices in the city shut down on Thursday, a day after protesters took to the streets demonstrating against changes to an extradition law that could see people sent to China for trial. Riot police flung tear gas, fired rubber bullets, and used capsicum spray and batons in attempts to disperse hundreds of thousands of demonstrators. Seventy-two people were taken to hospital, two with serious injuries, in some of the worst violence in Hong Kong since Britain handed it back to Chinese rule in 1997. Police and protesters were readying for potential further clashes on Thursday, but streets began to clear after rain fell on the city and a clean-up was underway.    Ms Lam condemned yesterday's ""distressing scenes"" and labelled them ""riots"".  ""These acts of rioting, which damage social peace and disregard the law, are intolerable in any civilised society,"" she said.  ""Clearly, this is no longer a peaceful assembly but a blatant, organised riot, and in no way an act of loving Hong Kong.""   Opponents say China's justice system is marked by torture and forced confessions, but Ms Lam has said the courts would provide human rights safeguards in vetting case-by-case extraditions to mainland China. She accused protesters of carrying out ""dangerous and even life-threatening acts"" and told them to ""calm down"". ""If a goal can be reached by radical and violent means, such scenes will become more severe, which will definitely put Hong Kong in harm's way,"" she said.  Ms Lam teared up as she denied she was ""selling out"" Hong Kong and urged people to refrain from violence, saying she didn't want to see anyone else hurt.    Sam Lung, a Canadian-Hong Kong journalist who joined the protest last night, he said the protesters were ""calm and organised"" before the police took action against them. ""The police waved the red flag, which is a warning that indicates the use of force to disperse the crowd,"" he said.    A group of Hong Kong students based in Queensland said it was heartbreaking to see the violence unfold in Hong Kong.  Zoe Leung, 18, speaking on behalf of a group of Hong Kong students in Brisbane, said many in Australia were feeling helpless and frustrated. ""It is torturing for us to see the current situation in Hong Kong, not only because we feel powerless watching the place we grew up in turning into chaos and there is essentially nothing we can do about it,"" she said.  ""It is just heartbreaking to see our loved ones in Hong Kong be violently repressed by the Hong Kong police force.""   Former New South Wales MP Helen Sham-Ho said fear about the possible abuse of power by China was driving protests. Ms Sham-Ho was raised in Hong Kong and said authorities must consult more with the community. ""The fear is concerning when extradition happens, whether there is any guarantee of human rights,"" she said.   In a statement, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said any changes to extradition agreements should follow regular processes and respect Hong Kong's autonomy. She said Australia had raised its concerns about the changes at senior levels of the Hong Kong Government. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advised travellers to avoid large public gatherings as they may encounter protests.   Chinese state media said in editorials published on Thursday that the protests were ""hammering"" Hong Kong's reputation. ""It is lawlessness that will hurt Hong Kong, not the proposed amendments to its fugitive law,"" said the English-language China Daily. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said China ""firmly supports"" Hong Kong's moves to change the law. ""Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs,"" he said. ""No other country, organisation or individual has the right to interfere. China deplores and firmly opposes the irresponsible and erroneous comments on the amendment and other Hong Kong affairs made by the US side.""   The US State Department said on Monday it was gravely concerned about the proposed amendments to the extradition laws and warned that such a move could jeopardise the special status Washington affords Hong Kong, but US President Donald Trump said he hoped Hong Kong and China ""worked it out"". When asked if China had used the People's Liberation Army to attack protesters, Mr Geng rebuked the journalist and dismissed it as fake news. ""I can assure you that it is a groundless rumour designed to mislead the public and incite panic,"" he said. ABC/Reuters"	ABC (Australia)

Several hundred riot police armed with batons, shields, tear gas guns and pepper spray sealed off the Legislative Council as a similar number of protesters charged their lines shortly after midnight. Police used batons and fired pepper spray at protesters, who still managed to close off part of a nearby road. Several people on both sides appeared to be injured and ambulances were called. Metal barriers were left twisted and torn in the clashes.     The Legislative Council is where debates will start on Wednesday to pass new legislation to allow the Hong Kong Government to extradite suspected criminals and fugitives on a case-by-case basis to countries where it does not currently have extradition treaties — including mainland China. Earlier on Sunday, hundreds of thousands had jammed Hong Kong's streets to protest against the bill in the biggest demonstration in years. Many said they feared it put the city's vaunted legal independence at risk. The older generation of Hong Kong protesters left earlier in the evening while a younger crowd made up of university students and young professionals continued to rally.  The rallies — and the violence — plunged the global financial hub into a fresh political crisis, with marchers and opposition leaders demanding the bill be shelved and that the city's Beijing-backed chief executive Carrie Lam resign.   After seven hours of marching, organisers estimated 1,030,000 people took part, far outstripping a demonstration in 2003 when half that number hit the streets to successfully challenge government plans for tighter national security laws. A police spokesman said police estimated 240,000 were on the march ""at its peak"". ""She [Lam] has to withdraw the bill and resign,"" veteran Democratic Party MP James To told crowds gathering outside the council and government headquarters in the Admiralty business district on Sunday night. ""The whole of Hong Kong is against her.""   Ms Lam told reporters her government would go ahead with proposed amendments despite the protests, saying the legislation would help Hong Kong uphold justice and fulfil its international obligations. Safeguards added in May would ensure the legislation protected human rights, she said. Ms Lam denied she was taking orders from the central government in China's capital. ""I have not received any instruction or mandate from Beijing to do this bill,"" she said.  ""We were doing it — and we are still doing it — out of our clear conscience and our commitment to Hong Kong."" Ms Lam said security forces would be back on the streets today, with more protests planned for this evening. The legislation could be passed into law by the end of June.  State-owned news outlet China Daily editorialised that ""foreign forces"" were trying to cause chaos and argued the law was much needed.   ""Any fair-minded person would deem the amendment bill a legitimate, sensible and reasonable piece of legislation that would strengthen Hong Kong's rule of law and deliver justice,"" the editorial said. ""Unfortunately, some Hong Kong residents have been hoodwinked by the opposition camp and their foreign allies into supporting the anti-extradition campaign.""     A 20-year-old man, Chan Tong-Kai, was at the centre of the firestorm around the bill. Ms Lam proposed the legislation earlier this year after Taiwan requested his extradition to face charges of allegedly murdering his pregnant girlfriend while on holiday there. In April, he was convicted by a Hong Kong court of money laundering — in relation to his girlfriend's murder — but authorities were unable to charge him with murder in local courts. With Chan's release is possible as early as October having already served time, the Hong Kong Government is using the case to push for the extradition law amendment to pass by next month.   The demonstration capped weeks of growing outrage in the business, diplomatic and legal communities, and human rights groups, which fear corrosion of Hong Kong's rule of law and the lack of an fair and open legal system on the mainland. Chants of ""no China extradition, no evil law"" echoed through the streets of the high-rise city as marchers snaked through the Causeway Bay and Wanchai shopping districts. Some carried yellow umbrellas, a symbol of the 2014 pro-democracy Occupy protests that choked city streets for 79 days. ""It puts our legal system on a direct collision course with that of the mainland, when we in Hong Kong talk about the rule of law, traditional independence is a very, very important element"", former Hong Kong Bar association chairwoman and senior lawyer Audrey Eu said.   ""But in the PRC (Peoples Republic of China), Xi Jinping, the President and also the head of the supreme people's court have said expressly, judicial independence is a mistaken Western concept. Ms Eu said the legal profession would have little power to fight against an extradition request once the laws had passed, and warned it could see foreigners living, working or transiting through Hong Kong also within reach of Chinese laws. ""Once the law has passed this will have repercussions not just for Hong Kong residents,"" she said. ""The international community and the business sector are extremely worried about this law and once you lose confidence in Hong Kong then of course they will just move away their capital.""     When Hong Kong was transferred to China in 1997 under the ""one country, two systems"" deal, the territory was guaranteed a high degree of autonomy, allowing it to keep its own political, legal and economic systems until 2047. ""The whole essence of one country two systems is you have two separate systems, in particular the legal system,"" Ms Eu said. ""What this amendment is going to do is take away the firewall, take away the protection between the two different legal systems."" But the Government argues the laws are necessary to fight crime, including drug manufacturing and trafficking, money laundering and firearms smuggling.   A group of 1,000 protesters gathered in Sydney on Sunday to urge the Australian Government to condemn the proposed new law. Accountant Ida Lee said she valued her freedom of speech, and that expatriates feared being seized by China as they travelled through Hong Kong. ""Ordinary people like me, I think, will live in perpetual fear of breaking some law in China, and as we're passing through Hong Kong we'll be arrested and extradited,"" she said.   Protest organiser Jared Fu, a university student, called on Australia to follow the United States, Canada and the European Union in condemning the law. ""Our major concerns regarding this bill include possible political persecution and human rights violations and even threats to personal safety if detained by China,"" he said. A Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson said Australia's consul-general in Hong Kong had raised the issue with senior levels of the city's government.    ABC/Wires

The two were granted bail by Hong Kong's highest court, the Court of Final Appeal, according to a post on their political party's Facebook page and local media reports. In August, the two were given prison sentences for their involvement in an unlawful assembly that kicked off the ""Umbrella Movement"" protests. The two had originally been given more lenient sentences that allowed them to avoid prison but the justice secretary requested that the courts review those punishments. The move sparked fears authorities were undermining the semiautonomous Chinese city's independent judiciary, underlining concerns among residents that Beijing is clamping down on dissent. Following the review, Mr Wong, 21, was given six months and Mr Law, 24, received eight months.  They were among student leaders who spearheaded the protests against Beijing's decision to restrict elections, which brought major thoroughfares in Hong Kong to a standstill for 79 days.   Local broadcaster RTHK reported that Judge Geoffrey Ma required each to post 50,000 Hong Kong dollars ($8,200) for their bail, surrender their travel documents and report to police once a week. Their appeals will be heard on November 7. Dozens of supporters and a large press pack waited outside the courthouse for the pair to appear. Mr Wong gained fame for his prominent role in the Hong Kong protests while still a teenager.  Mr Law was elected last year to the legislature, becoming the city's youngest-ever lawmaker, and then was disqualified from office after a government legal challenge over irregularities in his oath. A third student leader, Alex Chow, who was also convicted and imprisoned in the same case is not appealing.   AP"	ABC (Australia)

""Following the completion of clearance work in Causeway Bay Occupy area, the episode of illegal occupation activities for more than two months is over,"" CY Leung said. The chief executive said the sit-in protests, which began in late September, had caused ""serious loss"" to the local economy and damaged the rule of law. About 100 police swept into Causeway Bay on Monday to remove barricades as protesters scrambled to pack up their belongings from the smallest of the three main protest sites. One protester played drums next to a cardboard cut-out of Chinese president Xi Jinping as onlookers stood by. Police arrested more than a dozen protesters, including some elderly people, after they sat down and refused to move. ""I don't think it's a failure. This is not the end,"" said protester KT Tang, a legal executive.    ""I hope the next time when we gather in the streets, we will be celebrating, instead of shedding tears for achieving nothing."" Authorities dragged away tents and other belongings and dumped them in trucks and the site was mostly clear by noon (local time).  Police had announced on the weekend they would take action to clear the area. The mainly peaceful protests have represented one of the most serious challenges to China's authority since the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations and bloody crackdown in and around  Beijing's Tiananmen Square. On Thursday, police cleared most of the main protest site in the Admiralty district next to government headquarters, arresting scores of activists in a largely peaceful operation. That followed the clearance in late November of a site in Mong Kok, a gritty residential across the harbour from the main business district, a move that sparked several nights of clashes between demonstrators and police. Hong Kong, a former British territory, returned to Chinese  rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that gives the city more autonomy and freedom than the mainland and a goal of universal suffrage. The protesters are demanding open nominations in the city's next election for chief executive in 2017.  Beijing has said voters will only be able choose from pre-screened candidates. Protest leaders have said they will consider other forms of civil disobedience, given Beijing's refusal to grant any concessions. AFP/Reuters

The ruling, published in local papers on Tuesday, called for the clearance of three sections of the main Admiralty protest site in the heart of Hong Kong's business district. The injunction, requested by Hong Kong bus company All China Express, allowed bailiffs to ""request the assistance of police"" where necessary in order to clear the site next to the government headquarters. Since late September, student groups have called for a free vote in the Chinese-controlled city through largely peaceful demonstrations dubbed the Umbrella Movement. Splinter pro-democracy groups sprung up and fast-tracked action plans as student-led demonstrators considered a retreat from the main protest site.   The city's chief executive, CY Leung, branded the protests illegal and rejected calls for more talks on political reform.  He warned protesters not to turn to violence when the clearance started. Police were expected to clear the area this week with more than 3,000 officers, the South China Morning Post newspaper reported, citing police sources. Protesters on the ground have thinned to under 100, with most of the hundreds of tents pitched on the camp site empty. At their peak, the rallies drew more than 100,000. Clashes between protesters and police increased at the end of November after the clearance of protest sites in Mong Kok on the Kowloon side of Hong Kong Harbour. One man was jailed for six months on Monday for threatening to burn Mong Kok demonstrators with paint thinner, media said. Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to China in 1997. Under a one-country, two-systems formula, the city has some autonomy from the Communist Party-ruled mainland and a promise of eventual universal suffrage. Beijing has allowed a vote in the next election in 2017, but insists on screening any candidates first. Reuters/AFP

""Under the strong urging of the doctor, I have stopped the hunger strike,"" Mr Wong said on his Facebook and Twitter feeds. The 18-year-old, who had not eaten in 108 hours, said he felt ""extreme physical discomfort, dizziness and weakness in the limbs"". ""Even if I stop the hunger strike, it doesn't mean that the Hong Kong government can ignore our demands,"" Mr Wong said. Mr Wong and two young female members of his Scholarism student group announced the ""indefinite"" hunger strike following one of the worst nights of violence at the demonstrations last Sunday. Mr Wong's announcement came after fellow hunger striker Isabella Lo announced she would stop the hunger strike on Friday, days after two others joined in the strike. Scholarism said the three remaining students will continue with the hunger strike. Television news footage showed a weak-looking Wong being wheeled around the main protest in Admiralty in a wheelchair. He and other students on the hunger strike had been camping in tents near the city's government headquarters during the past week. Student-led demonstrators are demanding free leadership elections for the semi-autonomous Chinese city, with the main protest camp continuing to block a long stretch of a multi-lane highway in central Hong Kong. China's communist authorities insist that candidates for the 2017 vote must be vetted by a loyalist committee, which the protesters say will ensure the election of a pro-Beijing candidate. Mr Wong, who is in the running to be named TIME magazine's person of the year, called on Hong Kong authorities to reopen stalled talks with students. Before Mr Wong called off the strike, the government said it would not allow a hunger strike to affect its decision making. ""As a government we won't accept any illegal actions ... or actions like a hunger strike to convince us to make any concessions,"" Raymond Tamm secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs, told reporters. The protest movement for fully free leadership elections, which is in its third month, drew tens of thousands at its height, but numbers have dwindled as public support for the movement has waned. One prominent protest leader said the students would decide ""within a week"" whether to leave two remaining camps in the centre of the southern Chinese city after authorities cleared a third last week.  Benny Tai, a founder of the pro-democracy movement branded the occupation of the city's main roads as ""high-risk"" on Friday, urging protesters to turn to new methods of civil disobedience to push for electoral reform.

""As we prepare to surrender, we three urge the students to retreat, to put down deep roots in the community and transform the movement,"" Occupy Central leader Benny Tai said. The announcement came after hundreds of pro-democracy protesters clashed with police late Sunday leaving dozens injured, in one of the worst nights of violence since rallies began over two months ago. Tai said the trio would surrender to police on Wednesday in a commitment to the rule of law and ""the principle of peace and love"". ""Surrendering is not an act of cowardice, it is the courage to act on a promise,"" he said. Surrendering is not an act of cowardice, it is the courage to act on a promise.   ""To surrender is not to fail, it is a silent denunciation of a heartless government."" He praised the bravery of frontline occupiers and criticised the police as ""out of control"", saying it was time for protesters to leave ""this dangerous place"". Hong Kong student leaders have gone on hunger strike in an effort to force the government into further talks following violent clashes between pro-democracy protesters and police.   Joshua Wong, the teenage face of the movement for political reform, and two young female members of his Scholarism student group went on an ""indefinite"" hunger strike late Monday, a day after students tried to storm government headquarters. ""We are hoping that after the hunger strike we have a chance to speak with government officials openly, then there will be a chance to solve this Hong Kong problem,"" 18-year-old Mr Wong told reporters. ""We would like to put the emphasis on restarting the political reform process,"" Mr Wong told reporters after the trio's first 12 hours of fasting. The three are carrying out their hunger strike in tents outside government headquarters and were shivering with cold as temperatures dropped in the city. They were denied permission to board a flight to Beijing last month where they hoped to bring their demands for free elections to Chinese authorities.    Mr Wong has also urged pro-democracy protesters to regroup in the heart of  the city to demand electoral reform. ""This is not about withdrawing the National People's Congress decision made on August 31,"" Mr Wong told reporters, referring to China's parliament. ""We're asking the Hong Kong government to restart consultations on political reform."" Protesters, who have occupied key streets for more than two months, have called on the city's chief executive Leung Chun-ying to step down after Beijing in August ruled out a free choice of candidates for Hong Kong's next leader. Mr Leung has urged the students to look after themselves after clashes broke out Sunday night, with officers firing pepper spray at angry students trying to surround government headquarters. ""I hope the students that are participating in the hunger strike can take care of their health, especially when the weather is getting colder,"" he said. I hope the students that are participating in the hunger strike can take care of their health, especially when the weather is getting colder.   Civil servants were forced to stay at home on Monday morning and the city's legislature was suspended after protesters broke through police lines and occupied a major road outside the complex overnight. A court has approved an injunction to clear part of the Admiralty site, but an appeal against it was being heard. China's communist authorities insist that candidates for the 2017 vote must be vetted by a loyalist committee, which the protesters say will ensure the election of a pro-Beijing stooge. The ongoing protests have also sparked a diplomatic row between London and Beijing, with China defending its refusal to allow a group of British MPs into Hong Kong, describing their planned trip to the former colony as ""overtly confrontational"" in words echoing those of the legislators' leader.

After a tense standoff lasting hours, chaos erupted as hundreds of riot police baton-charged demonstrators with shields, pepper spraying and wrestling a string of them to the ground. The clampdown only stoked more protests, and a three-hour march by hundreds of people calling for ""real full democracy"" helped put the city's 28,000-strong police force further on edge. Bands of roving protesters stalked the streets deep into the night amid a wail of sirens, sometimes pelting police with eggs, bottled water and wooden boards. Police, some bleeding, lashed out with their batons to keep crowds back. The fresh tensions came as authorities have struggled for months to find a resolution to the most serious governance crisis in the former British colony since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Is there a need to really use so much force to beat us. We're not trying to cause violence but when they attack us we fight back.   Unrest has simmered for three straight nights since a swift and surprisingly smooth police clearance of Mong Kok's main protest encampment on Wednesday that resulted in over a hundred arrests including student leaders Joshua Wong and Lester Shum. Amnesty International on Friday warned the police against the use of excessive force after Wong and Shum both said they were beaten during their arrests. Several reporters were also roughed up, prompting the Hong Kong Journalists Association to lodge a formal complaint and plan a Saturday protest. ""Is there a need to really use so much force to beat us,"" said Wong Ching-san, a young protester wearing a black jacket and flip flops. ""We're not trying to cause violence but when they attack us we fight back."" Medical volunteers manning first aid stations treated scores of injured including those with head injuries, grazes and others who'd been pepper sprayed in the eyes. A pro-democracy lawmaker who observed the clashes, Leung Yiu-chung, criticised the lack of restraint by some police. ""Some of them were deliberately inciting people,"" he said. It has been two months since police first fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators from the main protest site in the Admiralty district next to government offices in the heart of the Asian financial centre. The protests, which have lasted well beyond many people's expectations, drew more than 100,000 on to the streets of Hong Kong at the peak. While numbers have dwindled, they have swelled to several thousand at weekends and at key moments given a deep-rooted frustration at China and Hong Kong's refusal to in any way offer to meet their democratic demands. A police spokesman said on Friday officers were worried about reports of excessive force and would investigate. Lined with jewellery and electronics shops, and grimy tenement blocks, bustling Mong Kok has been a key battleground for hardcore protesters and mobs intent on disbanding them. The protesters, mostly students, are demanding full democracy. They have called on the city's embattled leader, Leung Chun-ying, to step down after Beijing in August ruled out free elections for Hong Kong's next leader in 2017, despite constitutional promises made by China to allow eventual universal suffrage in the city of 7.3 million. China rules Hong Kong under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that accords the former British colony a degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, with universal suffrage set as an eventual goal.

About 100 police with helmets, batons and shields stood guard outside the city's Legislative Council in the early hours of Wednesday, facing off with protesters. A small group of protesters charged towards the building and used metal barricades and concrete tiles to ram a glass side door.  They eventually smashed through, with several managing to get inside, witnesses said. Police rushed over, using pepper spray and batons to keep other demonstrators from also smashing their way in. Four people were arrested while three officers were treated in hospital for injuries, police said in a statement.  The protest site was peaceful later in the morning, with just a handful of police on guard. It was the first time protesters had broken into a key public building, defying the expectations of many political analysts who had predicted that Hong Kong's most tenacious and protracted protest movement would slowly wind down.   A democratic lawmaker at the scene, Fernando Cheung, said he and other protesters had tried to stop the activists from breaking through. ""This is a very, very isolated incident. I think it's very unfortunate and this is something we don't want to see happen because the movement so far has been very peaceful,"" he said. Demonstrators have been camped on three major Hong Kong thoroughfares for seven weeks, demanding free leadership elections. Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to China in 1997 under a one-country, two-systems formula that gives the city more autonomy and freedom than the mainland, with an eventual goal of universal suffrage. The protesters are demanding open nominations in the city's next election for chief executive in 2017. Beijing has said it would allow a free vote but only for pre-screened candidates. On Tuesday, court bailiffs enforced an injunction forbidding street barricades at the Citic Tower, also in the Admiralty district. A similar injunction has been issued for a street in the gritty district of Mong Kok across the harbour.     Reuters"	ABC (Australia)

There was no resistance from demonstrators as workers dismantled metal barricades blocking access to a skyscraper opposite government headquarters.  Dozens of police and bailiffs stood guard as staff removed the barriers from outside the 33-floor Citic Tower office block, enforcing a court injunction won by the building's owners. But an argument broke out as the workers removed several more fences from a nearby roundabout, with protesters shouting that the area did not fall under the injunction. ""This is unacceptable to the protesters,"" pro-democracy lawmaker Albert Ho shouted at the bailiffs through a loudspeaker.   The court order affects only the immediate area around the skyscraper, leaving a long section of a multi-lane highway still under occupation and filled with hundreds of colourful tents. Protesters have been camped on three major Hong Kong thoroughfares since September 28, demanding that Beijing grants free leadership elections to the semi-autonomous Chinese city. Beijing has said it will allow a public vote to elect Hong Kong's next leader in 2017, but it insists the candidates must be vetted by a loyalist panel. Tuesday's operation stems from the first of three injunctions sought by private companies and associations in a bid to shrink the protest areas. Bus companies and taxi drivers' groups are pursuing two similar court orders to clear other blocked roads in the city, saying business has taken a heavy hit from weeks of traffic disruption. A second injunction seeks the clearance of roads in the Mongkok district, home to the second-largest protest camp, while court proceedings are continuing over other parts of the main camp at Admiralty.  The third protest site is in the busy shopping district of Causeway Bay.     AFP"	ABC (Australia)

Dozens of police armed with batons and shields swept into the area where hundreds of protesters were gathered and scuffles broke out in the gritty district that has become a flashpoint for street brawls. About 100 Guy Fawkes protesters marched through the district late on Wednesday night, joining the demonstrators who were calling for greater democracy in the former British colony. Three men were arrested after the scuffle, South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported. Meanwhile, about 50 people in Guy Fawkes masks gathered in the main protest site in Admiralty, chanting ""I want genuine universal suffrage"", before dispersing through Hong Kong's central business district, according to SCMP.  Some police officers followed the dispersed protesters and ordered them not to stay on the road. SCMP says some of the mask-wearing protesters returned to the protest site after 1am. The protests marked Guy Fawkes Night on November 5, which commemorates the foiling of a plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament in London in 1605. Guy Fawkes has become a symbol for anti-capitalist protests, and has been adopted by online hacktivist group Anonymous. The protesters, led by a restive generation of students, have been demanding China's Communist Party rulers live up to constitutional promises to grant full democracy to the city which returned to Chinese rule in 1997. In August, Beijing offered Hong Kong people the chance to vote for their own leader in 2017, but said only two to three candidates could run after getting backing from a 1,200-person ""nominating committee"" stacked with Beijing loyalists. On Wednesday, Regina Ip, a former Hong Kong security chief and a top adviser to the city's embattled leader, proposed members of the Hong Kong Federation of Students be given seats on the committee, broadcaster RTHK reported. Students are hoping to take their protest to Communist Party rulers in Beijing and are set to announce details of their new battle plan. Pro-democracy activists plan to march on Sunday from the heart of the city's financial centre to the Chinese central government's liaison office in Hong Kong. For more than a month, key roads leading into Hong Kong's most economically and politically important districts have been barricaded with wood and steel by protesters. The protests drew well over 100,000 at their peak and are now concentrated in two key areas - the district of Admiralty next to government buildings and across the harbour in Mong Kok. A handful of protesters remain in the bustling shopping district of Causeway Bay. Hong Kong leader Leung Chunying signalled on Tuesday that a much-anticipated plan to link the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock markets had been delayed as a result of the protests. He urged society to pull together to restore order in the city.   ABC/Reuters"	ABC (Australia)
