Businesses have long been vulnerable to boycotts from Chinese consumers if they become embroiled in controversy – which could range from anything from a dispute about the country’s territorial integrity to adverts seen as racist – but the fallout from the NBA row has heightened their concerns. Steve Dickinson, a lawyer helping multinationals working in China, said his clients were increasingly nervous about crossing Beijing’s often unpredictable red lines. “How can you tell thousands of employees that they’re not allowed to post something online. Nobody knows what will set them off, and that is a severe problem,” he said. “You never know what the Chinese government is going to get angry about.”	SCMP

Hong Kong government officials safely attended a flag-raising ceremony indoors, away from a crowd who were protesting outside and pepper sprayed. Here are six takeaways from the morning. 1. Xi Jinping pledges Hong Kong stability 1. Xi Jinping pledges Hong Kong stability Before launching the parade to show its military might, President Xi Jinping in his speech once again said the central government would strive to maintain long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macau, and would uphold the principle of “one country, two systems”. He did not mention the recent protests embroiling the city. The city’s leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor was seen standing on the rostrum on Tiananmen Square, watching the parade happily. This is a perhaps a lighter moment for her away from home in the past few months. 2. Hong Kong government calls on people to seek common ground 2. Hong Kong government calls on people to seek common ground At the flag-raising ceremony that was moved indoors for safety reasons, acting chief executive Matthew Cheung Kin-chung called on Hong Kong people to cherish the city’s “hard-earned stability” and work together to rekindle hope and confidence to start afresh. Cheung said the entire administration was working hard for the policy address, due late in October, trying to address deep-rooted problems in the city. 3.

A “black balloon flash mob” in Tsim Sha Tsui planned for 8am, which would involve popping balloons in protest against the flag raising ceremony, was quickly quelled by police. Police found balloons in a private car and two trucks around 4am in Hung Hom and arrested five people. Only a handful of protesters showed up at the harbourfront for the action, and they were questioned and had their ID checked by police. Later on in Wan Chai, near the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, where the official flag-raising ceremony was held, scuffles took place between League of Social Democrat activists – led by former lawmaker “Long Hair” Leung Kwok-hung – and a group of people criticising their slogans. Police used pepper spray while trying to separate the two groups.	SCMP

Industry heads predict a sharp year-on-year decline in business as tourist arrivals are expected to tumble around 30 per cent for the seven-day break following National Day on October 1. Restaurants expect a similar slump in turnover and hotel occupancy rates are likely to be slashed by half for the holiday week. The city’s celebrations on National Day have been watered down with the cancellation of the fireworks, as the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China provides the backdrop to a showdown between protesters and the government. On Saturday, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said he foresaw the number of tourists would fall significantly on National Day after fewer arrivals since July. The expected nosedive in demand has pushed many firms to offer large discounts in a bid to ride out the impact from the political storm, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, which has rocked Hong Kong for more than three months.

Occupy Central The clashes were small in scale and moderate in intensity compared with others in the months of unrest. Protesters quickly dispersed once police fired water cannons at them, retreating to the nearby districts of Central and Wan Chai. But the conflicts were a reminder of how much Hong Kong has changed from five years ago, when hundreds of thousands of people gathered in Admiralty to demand unfettered direct elections. On September 28, 2014, police fired 87 canisters of tear gas – the only time it was used since the city’s return to China in 1997, apart from during a violent WTO demonstration in 2005 – in a botched attempt to drive away the crowds, only to spark a 79-day protest movement that became a watershed moment in Hong Kong politics.    Five years later, the protests triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill are into their 112th day and show no sign of ending. The use of violence has escalated to an unprecedented level. As of September 20, police had fired more than 3,100 canisters of tear gas, with some 800 used on August 5 alone. Only one of the 17 weekends since the protests began has been free of tear gas. protests extradition bill Protesters declare ‘We are back’ on fifth anniversary of Occupy movement

Beijing has made plain its disappointment with “vested interests” whom it accuses of hoarding land or thwarting the government’s land policies.
