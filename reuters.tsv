Demands for the resignation of Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, were supported by 63% of respondents in the poll, conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute between March 17-20, versus 57% in a poll it conducted in December.  Supporters of the protests outnumbered opponents by a ratio of roughly two to one, with 28% against them compared with 30% in a poll in December, and 58% supporting them, versus 59% previously.  The poll showed a significant increase in the levels of support for key demands of the often-violent demonstrations which rattled the city for most of last year and into early January before the coronavirus crisis.  The survey also showed a widespread lack of confidence in the government’s coronavirus measures, with 54% expressing distrust and 33% giving the thumbs up.  The anti-government protests escalated in June 2019 over a since withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions of defendants to mainland China, and later morphed into a movement for greater democracy in the Chinese-ruled city.  Many protesters say Beijing has used its authority under the “one country, two systems” formula, agreed when Britain handed over the city to China in 1997, to undermine freedoms enjoyed in Hong Kong that are unavailable in the mainland.  “It is understandable that protesters resort to extreme means,” said Patrick Yeung, a 32-year-old IT worker who responded to the survey. “I hope Beijing can meddle less in Hong Kong’s affairs, which could actually stabilize Hong Kong and curb people’s anger.”  Beijing denies meddling in Hong Kong and blames the West for fomenting unrest.  For more comments from respondents see.  Lam’s office and China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, which comes under the State Council, or cabinet, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Support for universal suffrage in Hong Kong, a core demand of protesters aimed at strengthening the territory’s level of autonomy, rose to 68% from 60% in December.  An independent commission of inquiry, which protesters want to look into how the police handled demonstrations, is now supported by 76% of respondents versus 74% previously.  The demands of the protesters “haven’t been diluted, or forgotten, due to the epidemic situation,” said Ma Ngok, associate professor of government and public administration at Chinese University of Hong Kong.  Opposition to the demands of the protesters has remained virtually unchanged at 15%.  “The government should investigate the culprits behind the political crisis and should not accede to other demands from the protesters,” said another respondent, Ming Hon, an unemployed 49-year-old who moved to Hong Kong from mainland China recently and had jobs in cleaning and construction.  For the poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points, 1,001 respondents were randomly surveyed by telephone in Cantonese, which is spoken by the vast majority of people in Hong Kong. The results were weighted according to the latest population figures.  Following a large rally on New Year’s Day in which some protesters clashed with police, crowds on the streets have dropped from many thousands to a few hundred as Hong Kongers adopted social distancing to fight the coronavirus.  Some recent protests focused on the government’s decision not to fully close the border with mainland China, where the virus is believed to have originated. The administration has since banned all tourist arrivals.  Although Hong Kong has won praise for limiting the outbreak to roughly 450 cases and four deaths, the poll showed that many citizens remain distrustful of the government.  “The results in combating the pandemic are because of the self-discipline of Hong Kong people. The government has nothing to do with it,” said Evelyn Lau, a 23-year-old tutor who participated in the poll.  Another key finding of the survey is that while calls for Hong Kong’s independence from China grew within the margin of error, opposition to the idea has dropped significantly and indifference has increased dramatically.  Support for independence rose from 17% in December to 20%, but opposition tumbled from 68% to 56%, and those not leaning either way doubled to 18%.   “People talk more about it, so it becomes more easy to accept,” said Samson Yuen, assistant professor in the political science department at Lingnan University, referring to the independence issue. “When people talk more about ‘liberating Hong Kong’, it shifts the frame.”   With Legislative Council elections due in September, the pro-democracy/pro-Beijing split remained virtually unchanged from last year’s district council vote, with 58% saying they would vote for a pro-democracy candidate and 22% for a pro-Beijing one, with the rest undecided or not planning to vote.  The degree of support for the protests varied sharply by age, education and whether respondents were born in Hong Kong. Younger and better-educated people born in the city were far more likely to lean pro-democracy or support the protests.  The poll, the second in a series commissioned by Reuters from the independent polling firm to gauge public sentiment amid the city’s worst political crisis in decades, showed respondents mainly blamed Lam’s administration for the state of affairs.  Some 43% of respondents primarily blamed the Hong Kong government, compared with 47% in the previous poll, while 14% blamed the central government in Beijing versus 12% in December. The police and protesters were blamed by about 10% each in both polls.  Many protesters say they are incensed by what they see as an abuse of power by the police in dealing with the unrest. The police say they have used reasonable and appropriate force against illegal acts including vandalism and rioting.  China has denounced acts of violence in the protests, which it sees as being aimed at undermining Chinese sovereignty. 	Reuters

Hong Kong police took PAP officers to monitor the protesters and their tactics as part of a wider effort by the paramilitary force to deepen its understanding of the Hong Kong situation, they said.  “I’m aware that Hong Kong police officers have taken Chinese security forces to the front during protests, apparently in an observation role,” veteran democratic legislator James To told Reuters.   To said he had reason to believe the Chinese forces included members of locally-based PAP units.  The foreign diplomat, who requested anonymity and declined to be quoted due to sensitivity over commenting on security matters, also said PAP officers accompanied police to the frontlines.   Responding to questions from Reuters, the Chinese Defence Ministry said the PAP was not stationed in Hong Kong, while a Hong Kong police spokesman said they “stress that there is no such visit or observation by any members of the mainland law enforcement agencies”.  The State Council Information Office and the Central Government’s Hong Kong Liaison Office did not respond to Reuters’ questions.  The diplomat and three other foreign envoys, however, estimated that China’s government had ramped up the paramilitary People’s Armed Police (PAP) presence in Hong Kong to as many as 4,000 personnel - far more than previously known estimates.  Their assessments were based on intense scrutiny of the security forces’ response to the pro-democracy protests, which began last June, but have ebbed this year amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis.  Reuters had reported in September that an unknown number of PAP were among a surge in Chinese security forces moved quietly into bases across the city last year as Hong Kong’s government struggled to contain the mounting political unrest.  The rapidly-modernized PAP is the mainland’s core paramilitary and anti-riot force and operates separately from China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA).    Under 2018 reforms, both the PAP and PLA are under the ultimate command of Chinese President Xi Jinping, who sits at the apex of the Communist Party’s Central Military Commission.  While both Beijing and local Hong Kong authorities have been relatively open about the low-key role of the PLA in the city, they have never confirmed the presence of the PAP.   Some local legal experts and politicians fear the presence of the PAP - which has been devoted to internal security in mainland China - breaches the laws that protect Hong Kong’s autonomy under Chinese rule.  Those laws provide for Beijing control over foreign affairs and defense, but give Hong Kong its own government, law enforcement bodies and legal system.  “I think the police and government should make clear what has been going on to ensure one country-two systems is being respected,” To said, adding that he believed the PAP presence would remain in the city for the foreseeable future.  Lawrence Li, a spokesman for the Hong Kong government’s security bureau, said outside law enforcement agencies, including from the mainland, did not have the authority to enforce laws within Hong Kong.   Neither To nor the foreign diplomats saw any sign yet that the PAP have taken enforcement measures in Hong Kong, or deployed from their bases in other than observation roles.  But the diplomats said that taken together with the numbers of PLA troops that also expanded last year, the estimated 12,000-strong force marks the largest ever Chinese security deployment in Hong Kong.   The PAP units are concentrated within PLA bases at the former British military forts at Stonecutters Island and Stanley on southern Hong Kong island - both shielded from public view, the diplomatic sources said.   The size of the force has stayed relatively static in recent months, they said.   The often violent street protests erupted over a now scrapped extradition bill that could have sent people to mainland China for trial, but they later broadened into wider calls for democracy.  While they have subsided during the health scare, many people expect the protests to resume ahead of local legislative elections in September.  Diplomatic envoys and security analysts say they are closely watching the PAP in Hong Kong, because they believe it, rather than the army, would spearhead any crackdown should the Communist Party leadership in Beijing choose to intervene in future protests.  They believe any such deployment remains unlikely, however, given Hong Kong’s large and well equipped police force and the likely international impact of any such move.   Formed in 1982, the PAP was used to suppress insurrection and riots in restive mainland regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.  Singapore-based military analyst Alexander Neill said the deployment of the PAP force to Hong Kong was a sign Beijing sees protests in the city as a vital issue of domestic security.  “Looking at it through that lens, it is a Chinese internal security problem and that is what the PAP is there for. That is their role, so I think they are going to be in Hong Kong for some time yet,” Neill said.   ANTI-RIOT DRILLS      The PAP have their own vehicles, including amphibious armored personnel carriers, bulldozers and barbed-wired laying trucks. They stage frequent and extensive anti-riot drills on the bases, the diplomatic sources said.  While they share PLA facilities, they operate separately.  PLA commanders appear at some government and diplomatic functions as part of their traditionally symbolic role in Hong Kong, but the PAP has no such public role.  The Hong Kong police are preparing to take a tougher line against any resurgence in the demonstrations ahead of the elections in September, officials have said.   And the government’s budget announced last month boosted spending on police by 25 per cent to HK$25 billion ($3.31 billion), which will partly fund recruitment of 2,500 more officers for a force already 30,000-strong.  Assistant police commissioner Yuen Yuk-kin told reporters earlier this month that authorities were increasing monitoring of what he described as “local terrorism,” a threat he said was “gaining steam”.

The death of Chow Tsz-lok, 22, who fell from the third to the second floor in a parking lot in the eastern Tseung Kwan O district as police cleared crowds in the area, was the catalyst for some of the most intense clashes since the protests escalated in June last year.  Fears over the coronavirus have reduced the scale and frequency of protests this year, but there have been violent demonstrations on some weekends in a sign the pro-democracy movement remains active.  On Sunday evening, protesters, mostly in trademark black clothing and surgical masks, laid down white flowers, origami cranes and messages on colored post-it notes at a makeshift altar where placards read “Keep the heat; Fight until the end”.  One protester was waving a “Liberate Hong Kong” black flag, while a banner that read “murderer” was hung up.  There was a heavy riot police presence nearby and at least one arrest was made.   “It’s very touching. When I came here half an hour ago I almost cried, because I didn’t expect so many people would come today,” said 22-year-old computer programer Sean Chow, who is not related to the student who died.  “(His death) means something that is unresolved and something that needs to be fully investigated and I believe all the people here want an answer. It’s an absolute tragedy.”  Earlier on Sunday, Hong Kong police said they arrested 17 people, aged between 21 and 53, during an overnight raid of 22 flats in relation to a series of bomb plots between late January and early February.  Items including three homemade bombs, three electronic circuits and 2,600 kilograms of chemicals were found.  “In recent months Hong Kong has been faced with an ongoing ... violent campaign designed to intimidate, in order to try to achieve political aims,” Alick McWhirter, senior bomb disposal officer of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Bureau told reporters.  “It seems a potential tragedy has been averted.”  Police said the bombs were intended to be used in public events and aimed at police officers.  Protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula intended to guarantee freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.  China says it is committed to the arrangement and denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments including the United States and Britain of inciting the unrest. 	Reuters

The arrests come after a period of relative calm following months of anti-government protests over perceptions that China is tightening its grip on the city, though Beijing denies meddling and blames the West for fomenting unrest.  Lai and veteran democracy activists Lee Cheuk-yan and Yeung Sum, were arrested on Friday in the Asian financial hub on charges of illegal assembly, drawing condemnation from international rights groups, media said.   “We are concerned by the arrest of prominent Hong Kong businessman and publisher Jimmy Lai and two other longtime advocates for civil liberties and democracy,” Morgan Ortagus, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said on Friday.  “We expect Hong Kong authorities not to use law enforcement selectively for political purposes, and to handle cases fairly and transparently,” she added in a statement.  The spokeswoman also called for the rule of law and Hong Kong people’s rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression to be preserved.  The police said three local men, aged 63 to 72, were arrested for suspected participation in a non-approved gathering but did not confirm their names.  Authorities in the former British colony have arrested more than 7,000 people for involvement in Hong Kong’s protests, many on charges of rioting that can carry jail terms of up to 10 years. It is unclear how many are still in custody.  The arrest of the three men was outrageous, said Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, adding that there was no doubt its government was acting at Beijing’s instructions.  “This decision will send yet another signal to the world that the Chinese Communist Party is intent on throttling decency and freedom in Hong Kong,” Patten said.  Lai, a self-made millionaire who has made financial contributions to Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement and been a target of criticism by mainland Chinese media, was arrested in 2014 for refusing to leave a key pro-democracy protest site.  After the arrest he resigned as editor in chief of Apple Daily. He has also come under scrutiny from Hong Kong’s anti-graft agency, which raided his home in 2014.  In an editorial on Friday, China’s state-owned Global Times tabloid called Lai “a force of evil”, rather than the “hero” of democracy painted by the West.   “..he is a traitor, a criminal and a force of evil who has sowed violence and chaos in arguably one of the freest and most prosperous cities in the world,” it added.

Shareholders in Wheelock will receive one share each in subsidiaries Wharf Holdings and Wharf Real Estate Investment Company, plus a HK$12 cash payment, per Wheelock share they hold. That adds up to HK$71.90 per share on an undisturbed basis, equivalent to a record high. Wheelock shares spiked close to that level on the back of Thursday’s announcement, but subsequently fell to around HK$60 Friday morning – still up 28% from the announcement.   Property conglomerates listed in Hong Kong generally suffer from low valuations and thin trading volumes, and Wheelock is no exception. Before the take-private offer, its stakes in Wharf Holdings and Wharf REIC were worth around $16 billion combined, a third more than the parent’s own market capitalisation. The deal erases that discount by offering the stakes to Wheelock shareholders directly, whom the company says will also benefit from higher dividends. Delisting the parent, which accounts for just over a tenth of the trio’s average daily trading volume, could also help divert some liquidity into the remaining listed entities.   To be sure, Woo benefits too. Paying out HK$12 per share will cost him around $1 billion in cash, compared to the roughly $5 billion he would have had to fork out on an all-cash deal, based on undisturbed share prices. Shareholders worried the tycoon is buying the company’s assets on the cheap may not have much luck rallying support to stymie the deal, however, as the Wuhan epidemic and Hong Kong’s protest movement continue to hammer prospects for the commercial property sectors in the city and on the mainland.  Minority investors in Hong Kong are hard bargainers at buyouts. An attempt by Li Ka-shing’s CK Infrastructure to absorb cash-rich Power Assets was shot down in 2015 for being too cheap; in 2018 Harbin Electric’s delisting failed for similar reasons. Woo’s offer is a clever attempt to be fair to shareholders, without forking up too much money. Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Protesters gathered in at least two locations, including more than 100 near the northern Yuen Long train station, in the New Territories and near the border with the mainland, where more than 100 white-shirted men beat up black-shirted activists and passers-by on July 21.  Police came in for widespread criticism at the time for not preventing the attack, and for not immediately apprehending any of the attackers when they retreated into a nearby village and were surrounded by officers.  The protesters chanted slogans on Friday including “Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times” and “Hong Kong independence, the only way out!”  “We will never forget what happened on July 21,” said Lily, a protester dressed in black, part of a group of a few dozens at the Causeway Bay metro station on Hong Kong island.  “We shouldn’t forget to resist despite the outbreak of the Wuhan pneumonia,” she said, referring to the central city in mainland China where the coronavirus outbreak originated.   The Yuen Long violence was one of the highest-profile attacks since protests against a now-withdrawn extradition bill escalated in June last year.  The movement has since broadened to include demands for full democracy for the former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997, with protesters angry at perceived Chinese meddling in the city’s promised freedoms, a charge Beijing denies. Only a very tiny minority are calling for independence.  Protests have lost their intensity this year, with many people avoiding large crowds in the densely populated financial hub due to the coronavirus outbreak which has killed two of the 69 patients in the city.  But the outbreak has exacerbated anger with the city’s leadership and the influence of Communist Party rulers in Beijing. In particular, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam’s refusal to seal the border with mainland China, seen by many as a move to appease Beijing, has infuriated many.  Lam has said a full closure of the border would be impractical, inappropriate and discriminatory and that the government’s response to the crisis was based on scientific advice and had no political considerations.  There have been sporadic weekend protests drawing hundreds since Hong Kong reported its first patient last month, demanding full closure of the border and opposing some buildings being turned into quarantine centers. These have been largely peaceful.   But protesters last month torched the ground floor of one building due to be set up as a quarantine center, forcing authorities to ditch the plan.  A Hong Kong police officer was confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus on Friday. The 48-year-old officer had attended a banquet with 59 other police in the island’s Western district on Tuesday, police said.   Everyone who attended is now quarantined.  Television footage showed some protesters popping a champagne bottle to celebrate - the police became a target of protest violence last year amid accusations of brutality, a charge they deny.

The story was earlier corrected to fix Edgecliffe-Johnson’s designation to CFO from CEO in paragraph 2)  Feb 18 (Reuters) - Holiday Inn-owner InterContinental Hotels Group reported on Tuesday a slight dip in annual room revenue, hurt by a fall in bookings in Hong Kong due to protests, and flagged short-term hit from the virus outbreak in China.  The company started to see an impact from the epidemic in late January as it closed or partially closed 160 out of its 470 hotels in China, Chief Financial Officer Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson said.  Shares in the hotel operator fell 1.6% to 4,752.5 pence in early trading.  IHG said last month it would allow customers to change or cancel stays scheduled up to Feb. 29 in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan at no additional cost. Airbnb said last week it has extended suspension of bookings in Beijing until April 30.  The outbreak began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and has killed more than 1,800 people in mainland China.  The Crowne Plaza owner said comparable revenue per available room (RevPAR) fell 0.3% globally and by 4.5% in Greater China due to last year’s protests in Hong Kong.  “It (Greater China) is though, a smaller part of our business overall, representing 15% of our open rooms and less than 10% of our operating profit,” Edgecliffe-Johnson said.  The company has been investing in China, its fastest-growing market, and has revamped rooms at Holiday Inns to woo local business travellers. It plans to open 393 hotels in China and operates four hotels in Wuhan. 	Reuters

The hotel operator, which has 443 hotels in Greater China under different brands, said comparable revenue per available room (RevPAR) fell 0.3% globally, and in Greater China by 4.5%.  The update, which included results to the end of December, gave no indication of the effect the coronovirus was having on its results since Chinese authorities took aggressive measures to halt the spread of the virus a month ago.

The company said the impact of the fast-spreading virus would cause delays in Project 2022, its debt reduction program launched last year. The miner also cut its cash flow target to between $100 million and $150 million by June 2022, from its earlier range of $150 million to $200 million.  The virus outbreak is seen as a new threat to the diamond industry which has already been hit by lower demand from China, the world’s second largest market after the United States, following a prolonged U.S.-China trade war and the Hong Kong protests.  Coronavirus-related fears have also prompted the world’s largest diamond mining company, Alrosa (ALRS.MM) to shift its diamond auctions from Hong Kong to elsewhere.  Petra said the outbreak impacted consumer spending around the Lunar New Year and had a short-term effect on diamond trading, travel and retail in some of the Asian markets and further afield.  “Activity across the diamond pipeline is therefore expected to reduce until the virus is brought under control,” the company said and added operational cash flow benefits had been eroded.  Petra said the virus outbreak in China resulted in a shutdown of retail stores and the subsequent postponement of the Hong Kong International Diamond, Gem and Pearl show.  The company also reported a 11% fall in core earnings for the first half, but backed its full-year production outlook. 	Reuters

The virus has opened a new front for protesters after months of demonstrations over the perceived erosion of freedoms had largely fizzled out over the past month, as people stayed at home amid fears of a community outbreak of the virus.  About 100 people braved rain in the New Territories district of Fo Tan, where authorities plan to use a newly built residential development that was subsidized by the government as a quarantine center. Riot police stood by.   A 38-year-old mother of two said she had waited eight years for her home in the Chun Yeung estate and was expecting to get her keys by the end of this month.  “There’s no consultation and we don’t know how long they’ll use Chun Yeung estate. That’s why we are so mad,” she the woman.  Father-of-two Koby, 36, also expressed frustration at not being told for how long the public housing might be used for quarantine.  “I’ve waited eight years. I have two children studying in kindergarten and have already transferred them to the school in Fo Tan,” he said.  Protesters gathered in other districts on Sunday.  With Hong Kong property prices among the most expensive in the world, owning a home is a distant dream for many, and frustration over housing has triggered protests in the past.    Many Hong Kong people, already angry about what they see as meddling by Beijing in the former British colony’s affairs - which it denies - have criticized the government’s handling of the virus scare, piling pressure on embattled city leader Carrie Lam.  On Friday, the government sought to appease families that have been allocated a flat in the Fo Tan estate by pledging a special subsidy.  Three weeks ago, protesters set alight the lobby of a newly built residential building in another district in the New Territories, that authorities had planned to use as a quarantine facility. The government dropped the plan.   Hong Kong has had 57 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. One person has died of it in the city.  Some Hong Kong people have called on the city government to seal the border with the mainland to block the virus but Lam has ruled that out. 	Reuters

The outbreak, thought to have originated at a wildlife market in the central Chinese province of Hubei, has presented China’s ruling Communist Party with the huge challenge of halting its spread while at the same time minimizing damage to the world’s second-largest economy.   Beijing’s latest figures on Saturday showed 66,492 cases of the illness and 1,523 deaths, mostly in Hubei. Outside mainland China there have been about 500 cases in some two dozen countries and territories, with four deaths - in Japan, Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, the Philippines and France.  In the French case, the Chinese man died at the Bichat hospital in Paris of a lung infection due to the flu-like virus, authorities said on Saturday.  “We have to get our health system ready to face a possible pandemic propagation of the virus, and therefore the spreading of the virus across France,” said Health Minister Agnes Buzyn.  Robin Thompson, an expert in mathematical epidemiology at Britain’s University of Oxford, said that with nearly 50 cases in Europe, a death was not surprising. “The most important thing to point out, however, is that there still hasn’t been sustained person-to-person transmission in Europe,” he added.   After an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China urgently needs to get back to work. But some cities remain in lockdown, streets are deserted, employees are nervous, and travel bans and quarantine orders are in place around the country.   Those returning to Beijing from the holiday have been ordered to undergo a 14-day self-quarantine to prevent the spread of the virus. Many factories are yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains for everyone from smartphone makers to car manufacturers.   While there has been some hope expressed this week that the disease may be peaking in China, numbers keep rising and a trend has been hard to discern, especially after a reclassification that widened the definition of cases.  World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was impossible to tell where the epidemic will spread.  “We are concerned by the continued increase in the number of cases in China,” Tedros told the Munich Security Conference in Germany. “...We are concerned by the lack of urgency in funding the response from the international community.  “Most of all, we are concerned about the potential havoc this virus could wreak in countries with weaker health systems.”  The biggest cluster outside China has been on a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, quarantined off Japan’s Yokohama. Out of about 3,700 passengers and crew on board, 285 people have tested positive and been sent to hospital.   The United States said on Saturday it plans to send an aircraft to pick up American passengers and take them back home where they face another two weeks of isolation “out of an abundance of caution”.  Passengers on another cruise ship, which finally docked in Cambodia on Thursday after being rejected by several other countries, were taking their saga in good heart.     “Everyone says ‘poor you’. But there was no poor you. We had free internet and free wine. We had three-course meals. There was so much choice,” said Zahra Jennings, a retired staff nurse from Britain who had been on the MS Westerdam with more than 2,300 passengers and crew.  An 83-year-old American woman from the Westerdam had tested positive for the coronavirus on landing in Malaysia, health authorities there said on Saturday.  U.S. President Donald Trump thanked “beautiful” Cambodia for taking the castaway cruise ship in a rare message to a nation that has often been at odds with Washington.  The United States has imposed some of the toughest curbs on travelers from China, going beyond WHO recommendations and offending Beijing.  In Hong Kong, which has seen months of anti-Beijing protests, hundreds marched on Saturday to demand full closure of the border with mainland China and to oppose plans to turn some buildings into quarantine hubs.  “Doing that (opening such centers) is like creating more wounds rather than trying to stop the bleeding,” said Chan Mei-lin among the protesters. TV images showed police making some arrests and using pepper spray.  The sickness, now officially labeled Covid-19, has killed around 2% of those infected. Cases have spread faster than other respiratory viruses this century.  A senior Chinese official sought to project optimism.  “The impact of the epidemic on the Chinese economy will be short term and temporary,” foreign affairs vice minister Qin Gang said at the Munich Security Conference.  “When the epidemic is over, the subdued consumer demand will be released rapidly and the economy will rebound strongly.”  The Chinese central bank said the country’s lenders will tolerate higher levels of bad loans as part of efforts to support firms hit by the epidemic.  The economic ripple effects go far beyond China, with supply chain disruptions affecting multiple companies worldwide.   White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the coronavirus might knock two- to three-tenths of a percent off U.S. growth in the first quarter.  The sporting world has suffered too. In the latest disruption, Chinese gymnasts were forced to cancel attendance at next week’s World Cup in Melbourne because of Australian travel curbs.    	Reuters

On this winter day, the march was called off early by police. Two teenagers walked under the orange glow of a highway overpass. Lights from police vans swirled ahead, but for the time being, the empty stretch of road belonged to them. The world felt entirely contained in that moment, existing only between the young couple on a Hong Kong street.  The boy tucked a stray hair behind the girl’s ear and kissed the top of her head through the black T-shirt wrapped around his face. The girl took his gloved hand in hers.  Wing and Tony are two 18-year-olds in love. They are also front-line protesters in an increasingly violent pro-democracy movement that has upended this city for seven months. Normally quiet and reserved, the two have joined thousands of local teenagers in clashes with riot police all across Hong Kong, their hometown transformed into a battleground between China’s growing reach and people’s desire for more democracy.  But even in this extraordinary moment, there are the most ordinary of adolescent experiences, like first love.  Stories like Wing and Tony’s can be found all over this city, private moments hidden amid the public chaos. Like the movement itself, their relationship is swept up in the passions and contradictions of the young: full of both conviction and uncertainty, idealism and fatalism.  Instead of shy first dates where arms brush against the other in the darkness of a movie theater, Wing found Tony a free helmet and gas mask, and showed him how to wear them. Rather than texting about where to get bubble tea, Wing sends Tony’s personal details, including his lawyer’s phone number, to friends who are safely monitoring the protests from home.  The couple, who asked for only their first names to be used because they fear identification by law enforcement and arrest, met at an orientation camp during their first semester in college last summer. By then, the now-scrapped extradition bill, which would have exposed Hong Kongers to mainland Chinese justice, had already sparked mass protests across the city. Wing had just broken up with her boyfriend, who refused to join her at rallies and protests on the weekends.  It was a scorching summer, but for those few days at camp among the trees, the students were able to forget about the turmoil outside and return to the teenagers that they were.  A picture of Tony and Wing at camp show them with their faces covered in painted hearts and moustaches. Wing beams at the camera, while Tony, a thick monobrow painted on his forehead, feigns resignation.  On one of the last nights of the camp trip, students played a game of hide and seek on the lawn. The night air was cool and the kids shrieked as they ran from one another.  “There was a point when a lot of people were chasing after us, so we were running away together,” Wing said. “It kind of felt like we were running away from the riot police.”  After the trip ended, they exchanged numbers. Wing saved Tony in her phone as “Good Guy” in Cantonese, a term for boys who have been friend-zoned. Tony  saved Wing’s number under “Kong Girl,” a local reference to shallow and spoilt women.  Wing (on Whatsapp): Almost done with class.  Tony: I’ve got a short break too.  Wing: I’m not gonna tell you where I am.  Tony: I know already...You’re inside my heart.  Wing: You’re crazy. Piss off! Bye bye.  Tony had attended an all-boys secondary school and never had a girlfriend before. After camp, he couldn’t stop thinking about Wing and her big smile. Unlike him, she came from a privileged background and he assumed she would be haughty. But as he got to know more about her, his opinion of her changed. He was surprised and worried when he heard through friends that Wing was attending pro-democracy protests alone.  Tony had marched a few times in demonstrations, but had become disillusioned by the police crackdown.  “We couldn’t change anything,” he said, looking down at his hands. “So, I figured I’d rather be a happy ignorant pig.”  Wing was different. She had already made up her mind to do whatever was necessary to fight against China’s encroachment.  “I thought she was really brave,” Tony said. “I didn’t expect her to be so close to the front line.”  On the first of October, Tony heard that Wing was heading to the protest alone, and decided to join her. They were just friends then, relying on each other to keep the other safe.  The road was a sea of teenagers in black, their faces hidden behind the heavy fabric of improvised balaclavas. Shards of glass crunched under their sneakers. A police officer had just shot a young protester at point-blank range.  Wing grabbed Tony’s hand.  Suddenly, riot police were firing rounds of tear gas a block away, advancing quickly. Tony looked over his shoulder and ran, never letting go of Wing, her hand sweaty and slippery in his.  Blocks later, they turned down an alley. A middle-aged dishwasher saw them through her restaurant’s back door. “Come in, come in,” she said, beckoning them inside. The two huddled next to a toilet, holding their breath as police sirens wailed by.  Realizing they were still clinging to each other, Wing dropped Tony’s hand.  After that day, the two began attending more rallies and protests together. They formed a new daily routine: Tony would pick Wing up from school or her part-time job as a barista, then they would find a quiet alley away from the CCTV cameras to change into their “black bloc” clothes, a front-line uniform of black clothes and masks to blend into the crowd.  Together, they extinguished tear-gas canisters, dug up bricks for other protesters to throw, and hid behind makeshift barricades across Hong Kong. While Wing was always eager to push forward to the front, Tony was more cautious, keeping an eye on Telegram channels to make sure they could keep a safe distance from riot police.  “I was more impulsive than him.… I usually think and just go,” Wing said, laughing easily. “At first, I worried that he’s one of those people who would always tell others to leave the protest, but he wasn’t like that. Instead, he would ask why they were leaving.”  Rolling his eyes at her, Tony nodded.  “I can be the one to drag her back if she goes way too far to the front line,” he said, jabbing her on the shoulder.  The only time Tony could spend time alone with Wing was when he walked her home from the subway station. Even then, she was consumed by the protests, constantly checking her phone for updates, pretending to ignore Tony’s repeated attempts to confess his feelings toward her.  Wing: I want to cry.  Tony: It’s gonna be alright. Where do you need to go to bail your friend out?  Wing: Hospital.  Tony: Did you arrive?  Wing: They said it’s not visiting hours and won’t let me in. There’s so many police here.  Tony: It’s gonna be alright. Did they explain why?  Wing: No, they didn’t. I just bailed her out. She can leave after she sees the doctor.  Tony: Good. Call me if you need anything.  Undeterred by Wing’s rejection, Tony tried again to tell her how he felt. Knowing she liked being by the sea, Tony asked her to meet him at a waterfront park in Kwun Tong, an industrial area with shuttered factories overseeing a distant skyline of glittering high-rises. Stammering a little, Tony tried to take Wing’s hand. She shook him off, saying they weren’t in a relationship and shouldn’t hold hands.  “Everything’s happening too fast. It’s not the right time yet,” Wing remembered telling him.  A few weeks later, Wing messaged Tony to ask after one of their other friends who had disappeared after a protest. When Tony didn’t respond for an hour, Wing called him on Facetime. She relayed the news that their friend had been arrested.  Tony started crying, blaming himself for not joining his friend at the protest. He was tucked under the covers of his childhood bed, his parents sleeping next door.  “I’ve only seen him crying twice. The first time was when his friend got arrested, another time was when his grandma lost her vision because of her disease,” Wing said.  Tony had attended nearly every protest by her side, keeping her safe but never questioning her decision to continue attending rallies despite the growing risks. Seeing the usually stoic Tony sniffling on the other side of the phone, she finally admitted to herself that she saw him as more than a friend.  “Can you be my boyfriend?” she asked shyly.  “Yes, girlfriend,” he replied, no longer crying. Finally, he thought.  Wing: If you haven’t fallen asleep yet, I will call you back.  Tony: Just call me, it’s fine. This is a 24-hour hotline. I can’t open a 24/7 convenience store but I can be an on-call boyfriend that’s open 24/7.  Wing: LOL  As autumn turned to winter, millions more poured into the streets of Hong Kong.  Wing and Tony spent an entire week in November facing off against police near Hong Kong Polytechnic University, which became the site of a dramatic standoff between university students and riot police. But they were able to find brief moments of respite to act like normal teenagers. In December, Tony met Wing’s family and he invited her to his mother’s birthday dinner.  Sharing a birthday cake that Wing had baked for his mother, Tony felt like it was the first time he was experiencing a regular courtship. His mother liked Wing so much she told her to come back again for dinner. As they were leaving, his mother pulled him aside and told him to “keep her safe,” knowing the two spent most of their free time at demonstrations.  Tony’s mother just wanted her son to have a stable job and live a peaceful life. But Tony and Wing don’t think they can plan for a future right now. They feel it’s almost certain that one of them, or perhaps both, will be arrested or injured in the months to come.  “It’s like we have no future now,” Tony said. “Going out to protest these days feels like giving the police a chance to arrest us.”  Wing puts it down to pure luck that they haven’t been hurt or arrested yet.  “Even if I was injured, though, I’d still go out, because if we don’t speak up now, it will be harder for us to speak up in the future,” she said. “Other people will need to bear the consequences if we don’t go protest now.”  On New Year’s Eve, Wing and Tony left their gas masks at home and climbed up the winding concrete steps of Garden Hill in the heart of Sham Shui Po, a blue-collar neighborhood in Hong Kong’s Kowloon Peninsula.  By midnight, a small crowd had gathered at the top of the hill.  “10, 9, 8,” the crowd began to chant.  “7, 6, 5, 4 …” they all counted down in unison.  At the stroke of midnight, Wing yelled out a slogan that she had spent the past six months screaming at rallies.  “Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Time!”  Tony stayed quiet.  “I felt odd joining her,” he said, not quite knowing why.  Below them, thousands of apartment windows glowed yellow and white like distant constellations. Tony put his arm around Wing, who nuzzled his neck.  Asked later what he would do if Wing was arrested, Tony paused for a moment.  “I will wait for her,” he said. Riot charges can carry a 10-year prison sentence.  “Really?” Wing asked.  “Yes.”  “But what if I lost an eye, an arm, or a leg?” she said, defusing the poignant moment with gallows humor.  “If she got arrested, I’d blame myself for not being able to protect her,” he said. “It’s pretty sad that I found my first love during the protests.”  Tony took Wing’s hand. It was a rare day away from the front lines. They planned to spend it wandering around a shopping mall, like they used to with friends before the protests began. Wing wanted to see the new “Frozen” movie. Their heads close together, they laughed at a private joke and walked away, two teenagers in love. 	Reuters

Slow stock replenishment in the United States also impacted Remy’s third quarter performance.  These negative factors more than offset a stronger performance in mainland China, where the Lunar New Year, a crucial moment for the drinks industry in that country, starts on Jan. 25.  This year’s event will, however, take place amid rising worries over a coronavirus outbreak in the country.  Group sales reached 290.2 million euros ($322 million)in the three months to Dec. 31, showing a like-for-like decline of 11.3%. This compared with average expectations for a 6 percent decline in a company-compiled poll of 16 analysts.  Cognac sales alone fell 7.6%, worse than analysts’ expectations for a 2.3% decline.  In December, Richemont’s Eric Vallat replaced Valerie Chapoulaud-Floquet as Remy CEO. Chapoulaud-Floquet had been the architect of Remy’s push towards higher-priced spirits to drive profit margins.  The group said on Friday that it had decided to hold off on previously provided annual and mid-term goals but was nevertheless confirming “the pertinence of its value strategy”.  The publication of the annual 2019/20 results on June 4 will be the occasion to provide a new strategic roadmap, added Remy. 	Reuters
23	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1ZM0LD	January 23, 2020 /  6:10 AM / 2 months ago	Arrested Hong Kong protesters stuck in limbo as cases grind forward	HONG KONG (Reuters) - Derek Tai was arrested outside Hong Kong’s Legislative Council building last June, early in the city’s anti-government protests, which have seen millions join demonstrations over the past seven months.   Tai, a soft-spoken 21-year-old philosophy major, was one of the first protesters to be arrested. Five months later, he was charged with unlawful assembly, a crime that carries a sentence of up to three years in jail. In past cases, defendants have been sentenced to eight months.   “I didn’t really think they would charge me,” he said. Tai had planned to study in Germany this year, but like many of his peers, he now faces a potential prison term and an unpredictable future in Hong Kong.  More than 7,000 protesters have been arrested amid seven months of unrest over a since-withdrawn extradition bill. Of those, 1,092 have been charged, Hong Kong police chief Chris Tang told district councillors recently.  Just 12 people have been sentenced, Tang said, with the longest sentence, 14 months, handed down to a protester who had a petrol bomb.   For protesters like Tai, the scale of mass arrests and charges, longer-than-normal delays for hearings, and bail conditions that could land them in jail if they are arrested again have forced them to put their lives on hold - and discouraged them from returning to the streets.  The arrested demonstrators, 40 percent of whom are secondary school and university students, face a slew of charges, including rioting, arson, and possession of weapons. Protesters convicted of rioting, one of the most serious charges, can face up to 10 years in prison.  Tai has not told his mother he was charged. She lives in mainland China and could not understand why her son was arrested at a protest.   “She was disappointed ... she thinks I’m capable of doing more things than getting arrested, and our relatives in the mainland think I’m a rioter,” he said.   Whenever he feels depressed, Tai tries to remember his favorite Chinese philosophers.   “It really gives me strength,” he said. “Especially when they emphasize that I have the ability to see what’s right and wrong,” he said.   Tai said he felt it was important to publicly discuss his case and use his full name so arrested protesters were not reduced to a statistic.   Police have conducted dozens of mass arrests at protests and rallies - often with scant evidence, critics say - leaving the task of building winnable cases to the Hong Kong Department of Justice.   A New Year’s Day march this year ended with the arrest of more than 400 people after police ordered the dispersal of an officially sanctioned event, leading to street clashes.    (Graphic: Hong Kong arrests - tmsnrt.rs/37hlBM0)  Protesters and rights groups say mass arrests are a powerful deterrent for demonstrators. People who are free on bail may fear attending even legally approved rallies because if they are arrested again, they risk being kept in custody until sentencing.  The Hong Kong Police Force said that it is politically neutral and that officers only make arrests if someone is suspected of breaking the law. The politics of the arrested person are never a consideration for arrest or prosecution, police wrote in an e-mail responding to questions.  Under Hong Kong law, arrestees can only be held for 48 hours without charges. Most protesters have been granted bail, but supporters say courts are setting tighter bail conditions, including restrictions on travel outside the city.   Robert Godden, the co-founder of Rights Exposure, a local human rights consultancy, was arrested with a colleague in November during the siege of Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where they were acting as human rights observers.  He was questioned and detained for 16 hours before being granted bail.   So far, Godden has not been charged. The Hong Kong police said it does not comment on individual cases.   “There is an uncertainty that weighs on you; you don’t know whether they’ll contact our lawyers tomorrow and say we’ve decided to charge you with X, Y, or Z,” he said. “It’s a low hum in the background that sometimes gets louder.”  Godden said the specter of possible charges has a chilling effect on human rights and political activists.  Police arrested three volunteers for the Civil Rights Observer, a human rights group, as they monitored the Jan. 1 march.  Later in January, Hong Kong denied entry to the global head of Human Rights Watch, who had traveled to the city to release the group’s annual world report. Hong Kong’s immigration department said it would not comment on individual cases.  (Graphic: Age of those arrested - tmsnrt.rs/2TMeC9A)  The flood of arrestees has strained the courts, lawyers and advocates say.  Vannie Lau, a solicitor defending 10 arrested protesters, including Tai, said many lawyers are already volunteering for 25 cases, the maximum number for which the government will subsidize fees for defendants who can’t afford representation.  Lau said it was not uncommon for court hearings to stretch long past normal hours, recounting a hearing for 96 people in a rioting case that lasted from 4:30 to 10:30 p.m.   “It just shows that even the judiciary can’t handle such a large amount of defendants,” Lau said.   The city’s most senior judge, Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma, acknowledged the huge volume of pending cases at an event with Hong Kong and mainland Chinese lawyers, noting that most cases were not ready for trial.   He said a task force had been set up to study how the courts can expedite matters.  The justice department did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.  Activists have come up with their own ways to track the glut of pending trials. A Telegram channel called “You are not alone HK” offers real-time summaries and updates of protest-related court hearings. The channel, set up last August, already has more than 50,000 subscribers.   The group’s 14 volunteers line up for public seats in court hearings and provide a transcription service for families, supporters and lawyers. A volunteer who helps run the group said it has covered more than 100 hearings involving 1,000 defendants.  In December, police arrested members of Spark Alliance, an organization that raised money to cover protesters’ legal fees, on charges of money laundering and froze HK$70 million  ($9 million) in donations.  Tai’s legal fees are covered by the 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund.   Ann, Tai’s girlfriend of a year, recalled the anxiety she felt when she learned of his arrest.   “It felt like time had stopped for 40 hours. I didn’t cry or feel anything,” when he was in detention, the 20-year-old university student said. “When I saw him again, I felt relieved. But I also knew it was just the beginning.”  Ann, who declined to give her last name because she fears repercussions for speaking out, said 10 other friends had been arrested at protests. It has become routine for her to contact their families and find lawyers.   “It’s so terrible that I got used to it and I’ve started to feel numb already,” she said.  Tai’s next court hearing is scheduled for March. Not knowing whether he will spend months or years in jail, Tai has told Ann to be ready to move on.   “I don’t think the responsibility is on her to wait for me,” he said.   Classes at Chinese University of Hong Kong provided a distraction for Ann before they were suspended because of the protests. She finally broke down in the two weeks leading up to Tai’s first court appearance on Nov. 8.   “Before everything happened, I didn’t really cherish his existence in my life,” she said. “I was so used to the fact that he would always be there for me.”  Defendants and their families say they are determined to keep protesting and are willing to serve months or years in prison for the cause.   “I know that someone has to carry this responsibility because a thousand of us have already been charged,” Tai said.  “Some of us have to do it, and it just happens to be me.”  	Reuters

25	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1ZK1Q4	January 21, 2020 /  2:31 PM / 2 months ago	Hong Kong protesters decry police inaction six months after brutal mob attack	HONG KONG (Reuters) - Several hundred Hong Kong protesters gathered on Tuesday at the site of an attack six months ago by an armed mob on anti-government demonstrators, denouncing the lack of progress by police in bringing those responsible to justice.  Chinese-ruled Hong Kong has been embroiled by more than seven months of turmoil sparked by a now withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed individuals to be sent to China for trial.  The youth-led protests, including mass marches, petrol bomb attacks and battles on university campuses, have since morphed into a broader revolt against authorities and strong-arm Chinese rule.  Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 with sweeping promises of a high degree of autonomy and freedoms. But the perceived failure of Beijing to honor these commitments has fueled the protests, posing a grave challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.  China denies meddling in Hong Kong and blames the West for stirring up trouble.  Some protesters in a concourse below the Yuen Long train station in a district close to the border with China said they remained traumatized by scenes of an armed mob of white-shirted men beating up black-shirted protesters and ordinary people on July 21 last year.  A pro-democracy district councilor, Zachary Wong, criticized the police for not preventing the attack, and for not apprehending any of the attackers afterwards when they retreated into a nearby village and were surrounded by officers.  Yuen Long district councilor Tommy Cheung, who has helped set up a task force to probe the attack, said none of the 37 men arrested so far, some with organized criminal gang backgrounds, had yet seen their cases go to trial.  Jason Liu, a 29-year-old masked protester in the crowd, said he’d lost confidence in police enforcement: harsh on pro-democracy protesters but lenient toward pro-government allies, even those suspected of serious crimes.  “They always have excuses, and justify everything they do as right,” said Liu, who was dressed in a gray hoodie while listening as riot police surrounded the area. “It’s really unfair how twisted and biased law enforcement has become.”  Police chief Chris Tang told reporters that investigations were ongoing into the July 21 attack and that anyone who engaged in violence would be investigated.  He conceded that “there are areas that we could do better”.  “If we dealt with things perfectly, there wouldn’t be so much debate,” he said.  More than 7,000 protesters have been arrested in connection with the protests so far, including nearly 1,000 who have been charged. Police dispersed the protesters on Tuesday with pepper spray and made several arrests during a face-off in a nearby park.  Moody’s downgraded Hong Kong’s credit rating one notch this week as the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, flew to the World Economic Forum in Davos for a charm offensive amid the turmoil. She said in an interview with CNBC she was “very disappointed”.  Despite the backlash against Beijing, there are few signs of Beijing heeding demands for democracy and respect for the freedoms guaranteed at the handover.  China’s most senior official in the city, Luo Huining, wrote on Monday in the Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, of the need to “establish and perfect the national security protection legal system and executive mechanism, as well as strengthening law enforcement”.  Lam said in Davos conditions have to be right for a national security law.  “Enacting local legislation to protect national security has always been Hong Kong’s constitutional obligation. That is written into the Basic Law (mini-constitution),” she said.  “(But) I have to ask myself whether we have the right conditions conducive to doing this very controversial issue now.” 	Reuters

Chinese shoppers account for 35% of global luxury goods sales and 90% of last year’s growth in the market, according to consultancy Bain & Company, which produces closely followed forecasts for the sector.  Such statistics illustrate the damage that could be done to luxury goods companies if health fears deter Chinese consumers from traveling or going shopping at home.  Shares in some of the top luxury players, from industry leader LVMH (LVMH.PA) to the likes of Richemont (CFR.S), Burberry (BRBY.L) and Gucci owner Kering (PRTP.PA), were down by between 1.9% and 3% on Tuesday afternoon. Declines had been as much as 4% in early trading, wiping $15 billion off the sector’s market value.  Moncler (MONC.MI) is among the most exposed brands, given that it derived 43% of its revenues from Asia in 2018. The company known for its down jackets retreated 2.6% in afternoon trading. Salvatore Ferragamo (SFER.MI), which ranks Asia Pacific as its top market with a 38% share of total revenue, fell 2%.      The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak rose to six on Tuesday and nearly 300 people were diagnosed, almost all of them in China.   Graphic: Europe's luxury goods sector: here  The timing could hardly be worse, with hundreds of millions of people preparing to travel for the Lunar New Year, stoking concerns infection rates may accelerate during the week-long holiday that is also a peak retail season in China and overseas.  “I think we need to fasten our seat belts for the next few days and see if this is something that the Chinese authorities can contain,” said Bernstein research analyst Luca Solca, adding that the impact on the luxury goods industry could be felt as soon as this quarter if the outbreak spreads or accelerates.  Before the virus scare, the sector as a whole had been trading at about 24 times 2021 earnings estimates, representing an 80% premium to the wider STOXX 600 index, according to a note by broker Equita.   Recent gains have been fueled by signs the industry had broadly managed to offset the sales impact from the Hong Kong protests with growth in mainland China and other Asian markets.   A truce reached by Washington and Beijing last week in their 18-month trade war also lifted shares in the sector, as did the prospect of solid fourth-quarter earnings for the leading players.  “Given the recent run higher, this is as good a time as any to take profits in the luxury sector,” one London-based trader said.  Chinese travel booking platforms such as Trip.com (TCOM.O) and Alibaba Group’s (BABA.N) Fliggy said they would offer free cancellations on bookings made for Wuhan, the city that has been the epicenter of the outbreak, and some Chinese travelers told Reuters they were taking no chances and would change their plans.  The outbreak has evoked memories of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus that also originated in China and killed nearly 800 people worldwide in 2002-03.   At that time, Chinese spending accounted for less than 10% of the luxury market, but the fallout from the health scare left the sector trading at less than 15 times estimated earnings, according to Bernstein.

Ventus Lau was arrested on Sunday evening on charges of “obstruction of police administration” and violating terms set when permission was granted for the protest, the Hong Kong Civil Assembly Team said in a statement.    The organizers initially applied for a permit - known as a letter of no objection - for a march, but the police only agreed to a static rally in a park in the city’s Central district.  But as the crowds swelled and spilled onto surrounding streets, some protesters briefly barricaded roads with umbrellas, traffic cones and other street furniture and dug up bricks from the pavement.   Police then ordered a halt to the protest and began dispersing the crowd.  “It was primarily rioters’ violent acts which led to the suspension of the gathering,” Senior Superintendent Ng Lok-chun told reporters.  “The organizer has violated the agreements set in the no objection letter, failed to assist in maintaining the order in the public gathering event, that is why we have arrested Mr. Lau.”  Police said two community liaison officers were attacked with wooden sticks and sustained head injuries. They also said some protesters threw water bottles at officers conducting a ‘stop and search’ operation.  In a statement late on Sunday, the government said it “strongly condemns” the attack on the police officers.  The “Universal Siege Against Communism” demonstration was the latest in a relentless series of anti-government protests since June, when Hong Kongers took to the streets to voice their anger over a now-withdrawn extradition bill.  Organizers said 150,000 attended the demonstration, while police estimated a crowd of 11,680 at its peak. 	Reuters

The Chinese-ruled city, roiled by months of pro-democracy protests fueled by perceptions that Beijing is tightening its grip, was handed over to China by Britain in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” framework valid for at least 50 years.  Beijing denies meddling there, says it is committed to the principle, and blames the West for fomenting unrest.  The handover agreement states that the Asian financial hub is part of Communist-ruled China, but is assured freedoms such as those of expression and assembly, plus a different institutional framework, including an independent judiciary.  The protests escalated in June over a now-dead bill that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to the mainland for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.  “There is enough reason to believe ‘one country, two systems’ ... will not change after 2047,” Lam said in her first appearance in the city’s Legislative Council this year.  She said the understanding and the implementation of the principle required maintaining the “foundation of one country” and respecting the difference “of two systems.”  Lam urged the city’s youngsters, which have been at the forefront of the often-violent protests, to not violate the principle because of “temporary misunderstandings.”  “The scenario they worry about today may be triggered by their own hand,” Lam said.  Hong Kong’s protest movement is supported by 59% of city residents polled in a survey conducted for Reuters by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute in December. Only 17% expressed support for seeking independence from China.  Almost 9 in 10 of the respondents aged 18-20 say they support the protests.  Lam also rejected allegations of police brutality, which have been another source of anger in the protests.  “I do not accept allegations that police violence has occurred during the handling of seven months of social unrest,” she told legislators. “Unfortunately, in the past few months, we have seen continuous smearing and demonising of the Hong Kong police force, with the intention to weaken the law enforcement ability of the police force.” 	Reuters

Global recruiters have been pummelled by widespread political and economic uncertainties around the globe, ranging from Brexit worries in the UK to protests in Hong Kong and poor sentiment surrounding the U.S.-China trade war.  “There are challenges in EMEA, including social unrest in France and heightened political tensions, notably in the Middle East,” Chief Executive Officer Steve Ingham said in a statement, adding that he expects tough trading to continue.  He also said hiring in Asia Pacific continued to be impacted by trade uncertainty in Mainland China, Hong Kong protests, as well as bushfires in Australia.  PageGroup, which helps hire executives, professionals and clerical staff in sectors including banking, financial services and energy, said its operating profit for the year is expected to be in line with its prior estimates of 140 million pounds to 150 million pounds.  The company delivered two profit warnings last year as employers held off hiring, while employees were cautious of changing jobs.  Among fourth-quarter bright spots was Germany, which recorded a 16% jump in gross profit despite weak economic data, with net fees in the technology sector growing 50%.  Gross profit in the quarter fell 0.4% to 205.6 million pounds ($266.70 million) on a constant currency basis. The company said swings in foreign exchange rates hit its gross profit by 4.6 million pounds.  Last week, rival Robert Walters Plc reported a fall in fourth-quarter gross profit amid a difficult labour market, impacted by caution and uncertainty over Brexit. 	Reuters

The third-largest U.S. bank has made some progress. Its overall market share across advisory, syndicate lending and equity and debt origination edged up to 5.1%, from 4.9% in 2018. But Citi’s rankings in those business lines were unchanged in 2019, according to Dealogic data.  In December, bankers from Citigroup’s capital markets, investment banking and corporate lending teams gathered for their first full-year review meetings since the groups were combined. The tone in the meetings was positive, executives said, but after a year of stagnant rankings the unit still has a lot of work to do.    Citigroup has struggled to gain traction since it has yet to snatch away meaningful market share from powerful incumbents like JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), and Morgan Stanley (MS.N).   And, as it moves along with its strategy in 2020, the outlook is not great, industry insiders and analysts said.  Trade wars, recession fears and international events — ranging from Brexit to Hong Kong protests to political chaos in Venezuela to the United States killing an Iranian leader this month — have unpredictable outcomes that affect prices of goods and services in local markets, as well as global companies’ ability to acquire or transact between them.  The geopolitical uncertainty is also keeping some corporate clients, who would otherwise be looking for deals or other financing, on the sidelines, executives have said.  However, Citi’s expertise as a deeply international bank that helps companies grow and do business across borders, may not position them well for the current business trends, said Marty Mosby analyst at stock broker-dealer Vining Sparks.  “The world that was becoming more and more integrated is becoming less integrated and becoming a little bit more isolated,” he said. “And that’s not to Citigroup’s advantage.”  The values of global dealmaking and initial public offerings industry wide are each expected to drop more than 20% this year according to estimates by law firm Baker McKenzie.   “The investment banking business has never been more demanding,” said Tyler Dickson, the New York-based co-head of Citi’s Banking Capital Markets and Advisory group.   Citigroup has prided itself on being the most global of the big banks for decades, but after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, it pulled back from many regions and businesses. Even so, the bank still operates in 98 countries, partly to ensure that multinational clients have access to markets in which they operate.  Citigroup executives say they can win business from big corporations, even if the overall industry revenue pie shrinks.  Last year, the bank was able to grow the transaction value of the deals it advised by 11% despite the wallet being down 2% for the industry, according to Refinitiv data. Citigroup can still capture market share even with bleak 2020 outlook, Dickson said.  Dickson is co-head alongside Manolo Falco, who is based in London. On the first anniversary of their professional marriage, the two sent balloons and a cake, respectively, to the other’s office to celebrate a job well done.   The bank is focused on getting more business from existing corporate customers and adding new companies that fit into a certain rubric, executives told Reuters.  That includes technology and healthcare companies, as well as small-but-promising startups that might grow fast.  But the bank is not looking to gain share among smaller mid-sized companies that competitors including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America or Goldman Sachs are targeting.  “Between the two growth paths, I like that path better,” said Cary Kochman, Citi’s co-head global head of M&A.

Some who left the Asian financial hub after nearly seven months of often violent protests said they welcomed Tsai’s historic win with more than 8 million votes, exceeding the tally of any previous president.  “A weight has been lifted off my shoulders,” said a Hong Kong protester in Taipei, who gave his name only as Roger and said he had feared being kicked out of Taiwan if its China-friendly opposition Kuomintang party swept to power.   Authorities in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong have arrested more than 7,000 people, many on charges of rioting that can carry jail terms of up to 10 years.  “I hope Hong Kong can be like Taiwan, that in the time of our next generation, Hong Kong will be a democratic and free place,” said Ventus Lau, one of the organizers of a 1,000- strong rally in Hong Kong against the Chinese Communist Party.  “That’s why, in 2020, we need to fight autocracy together with the international community,” Lau said on Sunday.  Some in the crowd waved black Hong Kong protest flags with the slogan, “Free Hong Kong. Revolution Now,” as Tsai delivered a victory speech to ecstatic supporters on Saturday.  “I believe many democratic countries in the world, and many friends in Hong Kong, will feel happy about our collective decision,” Tsai said, drawing plaudits in Hong Kong’s online protester forums and groups on the Telegram messaging app.   The slogan “Today Taiwan, Tomorrow Hong Kong” has sprung up after the landslide win, to express the hope that Hong Kong too will one day have full democracy.  The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 amid promises it would be granted a high degree of autonomy and eventual universal suffrage.  But China’s tightening grip on the city and Beijing’s failure to live up to its promises have fed the unrest, in one of the biggest popular challenges to the ruling Communist Party since the return.  Many credit the protests with having helped to sway the Taiwan election in Tsai’s favor and deliver a rebuke to Beijing.        Tsai’s government, which also won a parliamentary majority, owed Hong Kong more concrete support, said Roger Wong, a newly elected pro-democracy district councillor from the city who attended victory celebrations in Taipei.  “I hope Taiwan can now speak up more for Hong Kong, especially the young people,” said Wong, 41, one of about 10 politicians who visited Taiwan for the election after a big win in November’s district polls.  While Taiwan has discreetly extended tourist visas and offered special mid-year intakes for Hong Kong students at some universities, calls have grown to amend the law with special provisions for the territory.  “This election is proof that Xi Jinping’s strategy of keeping Hong Kong and Taiwan under control is a total failure,” said Leung Man-to, a political science professor at the National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, referring to China’s leader.  “Taiwan should offer some kind of formal channel for Hong Kong people in exile to seek political asylum ... Tsai never dared do anything substantial before, but she could now try to do something new, even if it provokes Beijing.”  	Reuters

Taiwan holds presidential and parliamentary polls on Saturday against the backdrop of both Hong Kong’s unrest and Chna’s new push to get the democratic island to accept its rule.  The China issue is front and center in the campaign, especially after President Xi Jinping warned last year Beijing could attack Taiwan, though adding he would prefer a peaceful “one country, two systems” formula.  The former British colony of Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under such a formula aimed at ensuring a high degree of autonomy.  But that model has never been popular in Taiwan and is even less so now after the protests in Hong Kong, largely triggered by fears that Beijing is slowly eroding freedoms. Beijing denies that.  Speaking at her final, packed rally in Taipei, Tsai urged people to look across the Taiwan Strait to Hong Kong.  “The young people of Hong Kong are using their lives and blood and tears to show us that ‘one country, two systems’ is not feasible,” she said.   “Tomorrow it’s the turn of our young people in Taiwan to show them that the values of democracy and freedom will overcome all difficulties.”  China claims Taiwan as its sacred territory, to be taken by force if needed. Taiwan says it is an independent country, called the Republic of China, its official name.  Tsai and her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) are being challenged by Han Kuo-yu of the main opposition Kuomintang party. He favours close ties with Beijing and says this is the only way to ensure Taiwan’s security and prosperity.  Speaking at his own mass rally in the southern port of Kaohsiung, where he is mayor, Han criticised Tsai for doing little in the past four years apart from increasing Taiwan’s international isolation and described ties with China as “freezing”.  “They can’t produce any achievements,” Han told supporters, with banners by his side carrying a campaign slogan, “Taiwan safe, people get rich”.  He did not mention Hong Kong.  The United States, Taiwan’s top arms supplier and most important supporter even in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, will also be watching closely, having warned in the run-up to the vote against Chinese attempts to sway the election.  The de facto U.S. ambassador in Taiwan, Brent Christensen, is scheduled to meet Tsai on Sunday morning, according to Taiwan’s presidential office.      The Hong Kong protesters have widespread public sympathy in Taiwan, and both the DPP and Kuomintang have pledged to help any Hong Kong people who flee to the island.  Both Tsai and Han have rejected “one country, two systems”. The DPP has painted a vote for the Kuomintang as effectively a vote for the model, something Han has angrily denied.  Taiwan’s noisy, colourful elections are a marked contrast to China, where the Communist Party brooks no challenge to its rule and where ordinary people have no say in who governs them, something that can be a shock to Chinese visitors.  “I didn’t expect to see singers on stage. For a while I felt like I was in a concert,” said Yin Weiguo, a 27-year-old Chinese engineer on a business trip to Taiwan, who attended a Han rally in Taipei on Thursday.  “I just wanted to see what people did at a rally. There were so many people,” Yin told Reuters while visiting Taipei’s Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, a major tourist site.  Voting begins at 8 a.m (0000 GMT) on Saturday and polls close at 4 p.m. (0800 GMT).  The new president will be inaugurated in May. 	Reuters

One delegation of about 50, including a batch of young district councillors who stormed to a landslide electoral victory in November, arrived this week and has been networking with key Taiwan civil society leaders, academics and officials.  “We want to learn and gain more experience, to help Hong Kong people as they struggle on their democratic road in the future,” said Raymond Tang, a district councilor who attended an evening seminar in Taipei with fellow delegates on countering fake news.    The links between the two places has never been deeper: Hong Kong has been convulsed by more than seven months of anti-China protests, and Taiwan’s elections come amid heightened fears of  an increasingly assertive China under President Xi Jinping.   “There’s an acute sense of threat from China. What’s happened in Hong Kong has made everyone reassess its relationship with Beijing,” Joseph Cheng, a veteran pro-democracy activist and one of the leaders of the delegation.  “Democracy has taken root in Taiwan and it refutes the basic argument that democracy is for the West, that it doesn’t apply to Chinese people, which is the argument propagated by Beijing,” he added.   In a Facebook video late Thursday, 15 district councillors from Hong Kong, including former student leader Lester Shum, urged the people of Taiwan to treasure their unfettered democracy and to vote.  “This time it’s over to you,” they said in a montage. “Hong Kong and Taiwan, let’s go for it together.”  Prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong, who has been barred from leaving Hong Kong during an ongoing court case, also appealed to the youth of Taiwan to “protect Taiwan’s democracy”.  “I hope our Taiwan friends really go for it, and with their votes show the Taiwan people’s determination to refuse to bow and scrape before Beijing. This is the greatest support you can give Hong Kong,” he wrote on Facebook.  Taiwan has become home to a small but growing number of Hong Kong protesters who have fled there fearing politically motivated charges against them in Hong Kong.  They have no legal way to gain permanent asylum, but President Tsai Ing-wen’s broadly sympathetic government has allowed about 60 of them to temporarily extend their stay.  Around 6,200 immigrants from Hong Kong and Macau are eligible to vote in Taiwan.  “We will fight against the Communist Party with our vote,” said Edward Leung, a 58-year-old Hong Kong emigre who now lives in the southern city of Kaohsiung and plans to vote for Tsai.

The benchmark Nikkei index ended up 0.47% at 23,850.57 points. The index rose 0.82% in a week of volatility when a Wednesday Iranian missile strike on U.S.-led forces in Iraq rippled through global financial markets.  The attack, which followed the U.S. killing of a prominent Iranian general last week, sparked fears of wider conflict.  However, global equity markets quickly stabilised after both the United States and Iran signalled the desire to avoid war.  Market focus consequently returned to the signing of a trade deal between the United States and China to defuse a months-long trade war, which would reduce risk in the global economic outlook.  “Geopolitical risks simply do not tend to have a long-term impact on financial markets,” said Shusuke Yamada, head of foreign exchange and Japan equity strategy at Merrill Lynch Japan Securities.  “There were some risks to the outlook last year, like trade friction, but these factors are not in play this year. There is no reason to sell risky assets, which is good for equities. I expect the Nikkei to rise to 25,000 by the end of March.”  U.S. President Donald Trump, who last month said the Phase 1 deal would be signed on Jan. 15, on Thursday said the agreement could be signed “shortly thereafter”.  The deal is likely to reduce U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and boost Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural products - measures whose effects are widely expected to propagate throughout the corporate world, pushing up earnings.  There were 120 advancers on the Nikkei index on Friday against 91 decliners, while the remaining 14 members of the index were unchanged.  The largest percentage gainers were industrial machinery maker IHI Corp at 5.14%, followed by semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker Screen Holdings Co Ltd gaining 4.05%, and convenience store operator Seven & i Holdings Co Ltd at 3.7%.  The largest percentage losses were apparel retailer Fast Retailing Co Ltd at 2.78%, followed by Chubu Electric Power Co Inc losing 2.35%, and automaker Isuzu Motors Ltd at 1.92%.  Fast Retailing cut its full-year profit outlook due to worse-than-expected quarterly earnings results on Thursday, hit by Hong Kong protests and a South Korean consumer boycott of Japanese goods that dented sales at its Uniqlo stores.  The broader Topix index rose 0.35% to 1,735.16 on Friday. For the week, the Topix was up 0.80%.  The volume of shares traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s main board was 1.09 billion, compared to the average of 1.12 billion over the past 30 days. 	Reuters

One delegation of about 50, including a batch of young district councillors who stormed to a landslide electoral victory in November, arrived this week and has been networking with key Taiwan civil society leaders, academics and officials.  “We want to learn and gain more experience, to help Hong Kong people as they struggle on their democratic road in the future,” said Raymond Tang, a district councilor who attended an evening seminar in Taipei with fellow delegates on countering fake news.    The links between the two places has never been deeper: Hong Kong has been convulsed by more than seven months of anti-China protests, and Taiwan’s elections come amid heightened fears of  an increasingly assertive China under President Xi Jinping.   “There’s an acute sense of threat from China. What’s happened in Hong Kong has made everyone reassess its relationship with Beijing,” Joseph Cheng, a veteran pro-democracy activist and one of the leaders of the delegation.  “Democracy has taken root in Taiwan and it refutes the basic argument that democracy is for the West, that it doesn’t apply to Chinese people, which is the argument propagated by Beijing,” he added.   In a Facebook video late Thursday, 15 district councillors from Hong Kong, including former student leader Lester Shum, urged the people of Taiwan to treasure their unfettered democracy and to vote.  “This time it’s over to you,” they said in a montage. “Hong Kong and Taiwan, let’s go for it together.”  Prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong, who has been barred from leaving Hong Kong during an ongoing court case, also appealed to the youth of Taiwan to “protect Taiwan’s democracy”.  “I hope our Taiwan friends really go for it, and with their votes show the Taiwan people’s determination to refuse to bow and scrape before Beijing. This is the greatest support you can give Hong Kong,” he wrote on Facebook.  Taiwan has become home to a small but growing number of Hong Kong protesters who have fled there fearing politically motivated charges against them in Hong Kong.  They have no legal way to gain permanent asylum, but President Tsai Ing-wen’s broadly sympathetic government has allowed about 60 of them to temporarily extend their stay.  Around 6,200 immigrants from Hong Kong and Macau are eligible to vote in Taiwan.  “We will fight against the Communist Party with our vote,” said Edward Leung, a 58-year-old Hong Kong emigre who now lives in the southern city of Kaohsiung and plans to vote for Tsai. He says she can better defend Taiwan against China.  Some Hong Kong protesters fear Taiwan’s support will vanish if Han Kuo-yu of the Kuomintang opposition party, which favors close ties with China, wins the election.

Now the bespectacled 24-year-old junior engineer is launching a trade union.  His aim is to ramp up pressure on Hong Kong’s government, which has so far made no political concessions to protesters’ demands for greater democracy in the Chinese-ruled city, despite millions of people marching in the street.  “The ongoing pro-democracy movement has fundamentally changed people’s lives,” Ngai told Reuters, the day before he set up a booth along the route of a Jan. 1 march, to sign up new members. “It has forced many who were ignorant about society to stand up.”   As violent clashes with police become more common, the pro-democracy movement has reached a point of “anger and hopelessness,” said Ngai, and needs new tactics.  Ngai said he and his team persuaded about 90 engineers, architects and construction workers to join his Hong Kong Construction and Engineering Employees General Union in the past month.  His booth was only one of dozens along the 4 km (2.5 mile) route of the New Year’s Day march, each with a distinct flag and logo, attracting queues of hundreds of people to join new unions for civil servants, hotel staff, theater professionals and others.   Ngai and his fellow organizers are spearheading the biggest push to unionize the laissez-faire, ultra-capitalist finance mecca - where collective bargaining rights are not even recognized - since Britain handed the city back to China in 1997.  They are also at the forefront of the ever-experimenting Hong Kong pro-democracy movement as it looks for more effective forms of protest.  “The movement has been thriving on its ad-hoc character,” said Ma Ngok, a political scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “Now more people think the movement may be a long haul, so they need a more organized base to sustain it.”   About 40 pro-democracy unions, including Ngai’s, have formed in recent months or are in the process of registering with the government, with dozens more starting to organize, according to the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU).   The confederation, which last month started running crash courses on establishing unions, said about 2,000 people have already joined unions this year and thousands more joined in late 2019. The city has a population of about 7.4 million.   Labor Department records show that 25 new unions registered last year, compared to 13 in 2018. Of those, 18 formed in the second half of the year, as protests escalated.  Like many new protest tactics, the call to unionize first spread via the encrypted messaging app Telegram, where a channel promoting labor organization has grown to more than 74,000 subscribers in less than three months.   Traditional unions in Hong Kong are seen by citizens primarily as clubs for hobby classes, banquets and retail discounts. The new unions are motivated more by protecting workers from being punished by employers for expressing their views.  About two months after protests began in June over a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions of suspected criminals to China, protesters got a wake-up call on Beijing’s powers of coercion. The mainland’s aviation regulator demanded Hong Kong’s flag carrier Cathay Pacific suspend staff involved in or supporting demonstrations.  Many new unionists say the problem is widespread, especially where bosses are keen to avoid conflict with China for fear of damaging business.  A 26-year-old woman who identified herself as Cynthia told Reuters she heard of an auditing firm that hastily organized a lunch for all employees at the same time as a large protest which many of her fellow professionals wanted to attend during their break. She described that as “oppression” and said it was one of the reasons she is helping to establish the Accounting Bro’Sis Labor Union.  Some employees have been reprimanded for expressing political views on their personal Facebook accounts, said Gary Chan, secretary of the Hong Kong Financial Industry Employees General Union, which he said has recruited 160 members since late September.  Programer Alex Tang said his newly formed, 280-member Hong Kong Information Technology Workers’ Union was developing a database of employers who would not threaten or dismiss staff for supporting protests.  Many believe unions will provide safety in numbers.  “If we strike as individuals, we may be suppressed by companies,” said a 23-year-old assistant architect surnamed Lam, who was lining up at Ngai’s booth, wearing a black face mask, on Jan. 1.    The drive to unionize comes as Hong Kong is grappling with a recession as tourist numbers and retail sales decline in the face of violent protests.  While the new unions cannot promise much in terms of immediate economic benefits, they may in time be able to organize more effective strikes and address the city’s deep inequalities, said Eli Friedman, an associate professor at Cornell University who studies labor in China.  “It’s too soon to tell if they will get the union density to exercise that kind of power,” said Friedman.  Many new union leaders say they recognize that gaining members and changing cultural attitudes to unions will take time. But they are committed to improving workers’ rights, with a long-term goal of organizing mass strikes to increase pressure on the government to allow everyone the right to vote for the city’s leader.   “It’s a numbers game,” said Lee Cheuk-yan, general secretary of HKCTU and a former pro-democracy politician.   “We have to stay organized in the long run and consolidate the consciousness of the people of Hong Kong that has arisen over the past half-year,” Lee said. “All of the unions will decide together when it is time to strike.” 	Reuters

The company had come to depend on its Asian growth, especially in China, where Uniqlo’s mix of affordable basics and occasionally trendy items proved a massive hit among the burgeoning middle class.  At home, Uniqlo has faced a saturated market and weak consumer spending. It has also struggled to build brand recognition in the United States, though the company expects its North America business to turn profitable this year.  A weaker yuan and violent protests in Hong Kong during its financial first quarter to Nov. 30 served hit operating profit in the Greater China region, which includes its Hong Kong stores.  The company’s South Korea business, meanwhile, fell into the red after a prolonged boycott of Japanese goods, it said.  Annual operating profit was forecast to fall 5% to 245 billion yen ($2.24 billion), against a previously expected rise to 275.0 billion yen for the year to the end of August.  Its first-quarter operating profit fell to 91.7 billion yen from 104.7 billion yen a year earlier. That compared with the market’s consensus forecast of 110 billion yen, according to Refinitiv data.  There were bright spots, however, including an expected improvement in the United States and a 44% leap in quarterly operating profit at GU, its fashion line focusing on younger shoppers.  It also reported strong sales in markets such as Australia and India, where it opened new stores during the quarter, and reiterated its ambition to become the world’s biggest fashion retailer.  Fast Retailing’s main rivals are Spanish giant Inditex , which owns Zara, and Sweden’s H&M. The Japanese company believes it has a shot at beating competitors by appealing to a broad demographic and focusing on practical pieces rather than catwalk trends. 	Reuters

The mostly young men and women who came to Taiwan after taking part in increasingly violent protests in support of democracy in Hong Kong have no legal way to gain permanent asylum, but President Tsai Ing-wen’s broadly sympathetic government has allowed about 60 of them to temporarily extend their stay.   Some of those protesters fear that support will vanish if the Jan. 11 election is won by Han Kuo-yu, the presidential candidate for Taiwan’s Kuomintang opposition party, which favors close ties with China.    “If Han Kuo-yu is elected, I will buy a flight ticket and flee to another country right away,” a protestor in his early 30s who asked only to be identified as Jero told Reuters.  Jero said he flew to Taiwan on a tourist visa days after he took part in the storming of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council on July 1 fearing he could be charged with rioting, which carries a maximum prison term of 10 years.  He now lives in a small studio in Taipei funded by a network of local activists supporting the protesters.       The issue of Hong Kong has played a large role in Taiwan’s election campaign. Tsai has vowed to defend the island’s sovereignty and has rejected China’s suggestion of a “one country, two systems” political formula, saying it has failed in Hong Kong.  Han, who says he wants to forge strong ties with Beijing and met with Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam and senior Chinese officials last year, has accused Tsai of using the Hong Kong protests to whip up fears of China for electoral gain.  Both Tsai and Han have voiced support for Hong Kong protesters. But the prospect of a Han presidency is more concerning to the protesters.  “Hong Kong people are fighting against the Chinese Communist Party, but how could we convince ourselves that the Kuomintang is also against the Communist Party?” said a protester called Roger, whose tourist visa has been extended twice since his arrival in Taiwan in July.  Jacob Lin, a Taipei-based lawyer who is part of a team that has been offering legal assistance to protesters seeking residency in Taiwan since mid-summer, said many protesters are worried about a change of political control.  “If the ruling party is replaced, the treatment for protesters may be quite different,” he said, referring to Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).           Responding to protesters’ concerns about a Han victory, Han spokeswoman Anne Wang urged Hong Kong protesters not to be used by the DPP for electoral gain.   “I hope they have a true understanding of Mr. Han’s insistence on the value of democracy and freedom,” she said. “He’s solely against provocation, conflict and war, but he’s in full support of Hong Kong’s democracy and freedom.”      Hong Kong’s Security Bureau told Reuters in a statement that those accused of breaking the law in the city will have an open and fair trial, and any accusation of politically motivated prosecutions are “unfounded.”  Taiwan’s government has helped close to 60 protesters who are seeking shelter on the island for “political” reasons since the protests started about six months ago, a senior government official with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.   The official, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said Taiwan has been offering “assistance on an individual basis” to protesters, discreetly allowing them to extend tourist visas multiple times or facilitating applications for student or work visas.  Taiwan’s government will not deport those who had made it there, the official said.   “If we don’t help Hong Kong when they are in trouble, who is going to help Taiwan when we are in trouble?” he said.    Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement that it will “appropriately handle individual cases” in accordance with existing laws, without elaborating.   Tired of waiting around, some are taking direct action to help the protesters restart their lives in Taiwan.  Hong Kong-based rights lawyer Daniel Wong is leading an initiative to set up at least 10 companies from a laundry service to a restaurant in Taiwan to give protesters much-needed residency via work visas.   Wong said the plan, dubbed “project protective umbrella,” will be funded by a group of anonymous supporters in Taiwan and Hong Kong, many of whom are lawyers, doctors and other professionals.   “We are going to help our own kids,” he said. “Hong Kong people are not refugees.”  Huang Chun-sheng, a pastor at a Presbyterian Church in Taipei which has received more than 100 protesters said he will set up a foundation for Hong Kongers in Taiwan to coordinate funding support for those needing shelters.  He said a few of those protesters had since returned to Hong Kong in the belief that they would likely not be charged there.   Shopping for daily necessities in Taipei, a protester in her 20s who identified herself as Tiffany sounded caution on the coming vote, and urged Taiwanese to vote for Tsai, who she says can protect the island’s freedoms.   “I hope to study and find a job in Taiwan,” she said. “I hope Taiwanese can cherish the votes in their hands.” 	Reuters

Sometimes it was personal. I felt it, too.  As I sat on a bridge overlooking campus, I sent a WhatsApp message to my closest friend. I had already told her I was on the campus reporting. This time I typed out another message, saying that as a Hong Konger born and raised, I felt reporting was the only thing I could do for my city.  The campus was encircled by thousands of police, blocking off escape routes. Inside, hundreds of protesters were preparing to fight with improvised weapons, including arrows and petrol bombs.  I stayed put. A police crackdown seemed imminent.  I followed a group of protesters as they attempted to block one of the back routes to the campus to prevent police from storming in. As I ran after the black-clad protesters carrying metal pipes and umbrellas, I passed a library with black graffiti sprayed across its bulletin board.  “Why have universities become battlegrounds?” it read.  I had aspirations of becoming a war correspondent one day, but I never imagined that my hometown would become a conflict zone.  I had already spent almost half a year covering near daily protests and sometimes violent clashes between police and pro-democracy demonstrators for Reuters. I had seen and felt the anger, desperation and fear of the protesters of my generation, people in college, people graduating to an uncertain future.  Not knowing how long the siege would last, Reuters reporters and others converted an empty classroom into a makeshift newsroom. We projected live feeds on a whiteboard to monitor attempts by protesters outside to rescue the students and the encroaching police circling the campus.  As it became clear they were trapped and police would wait them out, protesters tried different ways to flee. Everyone understood they could face prosecution and prison if arrested.  Some abseiled down a bridge, jumping down to getaway motorcycles on the highway. The police began firing tear gas toward the bridge and arrested some escapees.  There was Ethan, who, like many others, asked to be only identified by his first name. Ethan studied blueprints of the Hong Kong sewer system he found online to engineer an escape for his friends trapped inside campus. He went down the sewers from outside, and waded through raw sludge for half an hour to lead his friends back out the way he had come.  There was Bowie, who had tried to escape on her own through the sewers, crawling for an hour in the dark labyrinth under campus, cutting and bruising herself. She finally found an exit, only to realize that she was still trapped inside. She was carried away in an ambulance.  As the protesters argued about whether they should leave, a teenage protester walked up to me and asked me for a pen and paper.  “I want to write down that I don’t have any severe injuries before leaving the campus,” he said, voicing a fear common among protesters that they could be injured during arrest and detention.  I gave him my pen. I apologized I had no paper with me.  On the morning of Nov 19, after two days inside the campus, I was taking a walk when I came across a rainbow formed when the morning light hit water dripping from a hydrant opened by protesters. It was a rare moment of grace, near the bridge where protesters had earlier fled by night.  Soon, the campus began to feel deserted. The stench of rotting food was everywhere.  Conversations became terse and infrequent. Fears of undercover cops spread. Some protesters isolated themselves.  After five days and four nights, I left, swapping out places through the police lines with another Reuters reporter. The siege continued for another week.  Afterwards, the police said they had arrested 1,377 people, 318 of them under 18.  Police fired 1,458 tear gas rounds, 1,391 rubber bullets, 325 bean bag rounds and 265 sponge rounds.  Nearly 4,000 petrol bombs, 1,338 explosives, 601 corrosive liquids and 573 weapons were seized.  The campus will resume classes on January 13, officials said. 	Reuters

Taiwan has been a democratic success story since holding its first direct presidential election in 1996, the culmination of decades of struggle against authoritarian rule and martial law under the Kuomintang, which ruled China until forced to flee to Taiwan in 1949 after loosing a civil war with the Communists.  President Tsai Ing-wen of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party is seeking a second term, and is being challenged by the Kuomintang’s Han Kuo-yu, who favors close ties with Beijing and says this is the only way to ensure Taiwan’s security and prosperity.  The issue of China has taken front and center in the campaign, especially after President Xi Jinping warned last year they could attack Taiwan, though said he’d prefer a peaceful “one country, two systems” formula to get control of the island.  Both Tsai and Han have rejected “one country, two systems”, though the DPP has painted a vote for the Kuomintang as effectively a vote for that model. Han has angrily denied this.  On Monday, Tsai’s team released a slick new campaign video comparing Taiwan’s freedoms with the struggle in Hong Kong, interspersed with images of Xi and Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam.  “A few hundred miles from here, many young people are using their blood and tears to defend freedom,” Tsai wrote on Facebook in introducing the video.  The idea of imposing a “one country, two systems” model of a high degree of autonomy much like China offers the former British colony of Hong Kong has never been popular in Taiwan.  It is even less so now after months of anti-government protests in the former British colony. The protesters have widespread public sympathy in Taiwan, and both the DPP and Kuomintang have pledged to help those who flee to the island.  Han has complained of “dirty tricks” being used to smear him as a puppet for China, especially revelations in Australian media from a self-proclaimed Chinese spy who claimed China has supported Han. Han strongly rejects this.  “I beseech Taiwan’s people, in the 2020 presidential and parliamentary election, open your eyes. I hope Taiwan’s people see these wicked smears to paint me black, red and yellow and make a rational decision,” Han said on Tuesday.  In the run-up to the election, China has repeated its “one country, two systems” offer to Taiwan.   Liu Jieyi, the urbane head of China’s policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office, wrote in the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily last week that people in Taiwan were “positively exploring” this model, though offered no evidence.  But one Chinese official, who meets regularly with senior members of the People’s Liberation Army, told Reuters that the Hong Kong protests had “increased the difficulty of getting Taiwan back”.  “What’s happening there is scaring Taiwan,” the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, referring to conversations with military officers.  While China has denied seeking to interfere in Taiwan’s elections, Taiwan’s parliament on the final day of last year passed a new anti-infiltration law designed to stop Chinese influence on Taiwan’s democracy.          China’s military is not idly sitting on the sidelines.  Its newest aircraft carrier, the Shandong, has twice sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait in the past two months, most recently in late December.  The United States, Taiwan’s main arms supplier and strongest international backer even in the absence of official diplomatic ties, has said it is concerned at Chinese efforts to sway the election.  Zhou Bo, director of the Center for Security Cooperation of the Office for International Military Cooperation at China’s Defense Ministry, said China “of course” wanted to resolve the “Taiwan issue” peacefully.  But China could not sit by while Taiwan continued attempts to distance itself from China, and the United States should heed that warning, he said.  “I don’t know whether the United States is prepared to pay the price militarily for Taiwan.” 	Reuters

The demonstrators in Sheung Shui took aim at so-called “parallel traders” from China who buy vast amounts of duty free goods in Hong Kong and take them back to the mainland to sell at a profit.  Locals say it pushes up prices, overcrowds neighborhoods and adds to growing tensions between Hong Kong residents and mainland Chinese.  “The mainland Chinese come here, block the streets with their bags ... rents have gone up and it has made things more expensive for Hong Kongers,” said Jasmin, a 19-year old student dressed all in black, who only gave her first name.   “I want the government to know that too many of them are coming over here.”  The marchers, including families with children, shouted slogans such as “Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our times!” and “Patriots use China-made products, don’t parallel trade!”  Organizers estimated 10,000 people took part in the march, while police estimated a crowd of 2,500 at its peak.  After the march ended, protesters dressed in black and wearing face masks remained in the area despite calls from organizers to disperse immediately. At one point, riot police stormed through, hitting protesters with batons and using pepper spray. It was unclear what triggered their intervention.  A few dozen people were arrested. They were seen sitting on the ground and leaning against a wall while police took down their details and were later escorted into two white buses.  Many shops in the area were closed.  Earlier in the day, in a separated incident, police fired tear gas to disperse a group of protesters hurling petrol bombs over the fence of the Sheung Shui police station before the march, damaging one police vehicle.  Sunday’s protests follow a march in central Hong Kong of at least tens of thousands on New Year’s Day and an escalation in clashes with the police over the festive period.  Anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong escalated in June over a now-withdrawn extradition bill, but have since developed into a broader movement, with demands including universal suffrage and an independent inquiry against alleged police brutality.  The police maintain they have acted with restraint.  Many people in Hong Kong are angered by Beijing’s tight grip on the city which was promised a high degree of autonomy under this framework when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  Beijing denies interference and blames the West for fomenting the unrest.  The protest movement is supported by 59% of the city’s residents polled in a survey conducted for Reuters by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute.  In a Saturday statement, China’s ministry of human resources and social security said the head of its Hong Kong Liaison Office, the most senior mainland political official based in the Chinese-controlled territory, had been replaced.  Wang Zhimin, who had held the post since 2017, had been replaced by Luo Huining, who until November was the top communist party official in the northern province of Shanxi.

52	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1Z30AD	January 4, 2020 /  11:05 AM / in 3 months	China replaces head of Hong Kong liaison office amid ongoing protests	SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China has replaced the head of its Hong Kong Liaison Office, the most senior mainland political official based in the Chinese-controlled territory, following more than six months of often-violent anti-government protests in the city.  Wang Zhimin, who had held the post since 2017, had been replaced by 65-year-old Luo Huining, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security said on its website late on Saturday. Until November, Luo was the top official of China’s ruling Communist Party in the northern province of Shanxi.  Reuters reported exclusively in November that Beijing was considering potential replacements for Wang, in a sign of dissatisfaction with the Liaison Office’s handling of the crisis, the worst since the city reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997.  Saturday’s statement gave no other details on the change.  Luo, a loyalist of President Xi Jinping, has not previously held any Hong Kong-related position and is at the age when top Chinese officials typically retire. In Shanxi, he had been tasked with cleaning up a graft-ridden, coal-rich region where corruption was once likened to cancer.  The Liaison Office, which reports to China’s State Council, serves as the platform for Beijing to project its influence in the city, and has come in for criticism in Hong Kong and mainland China for misjudging the situation in the city.  Wang is the shortest serving Liaison office director since 1997.  Ma Ngok, a political scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said it had been only a matter of time before Beijing made Hong Kong-related personnel changes, and that the switch did not necessarily indicate a change in policy.  “Beijing is having trouble devising new policy in Hong Kong,” Ma said.  “Given his age it is possible he is only a stop-gap appointment,” Ma said of Luo.  Johnny Lau, a political scientist and commentator, said Wang’s exit was unlikely to placate Hong Kong protesters who have demanded that the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, step down.  Writing in the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily in 2017, Luo said Shanxi province had been ardently following instructions from Xi to clean up the mess there.  “All the province’s people have deeply felt that the all-out efforts to enforce party discipline have been like spring rain washing away the smog,” Luo wrote.  Before moving to Shanxi, Luo had been the top party official in the western province of Qinghai.  “Shanxi has gone from being a victim of a regression in its political environment to being a beneficiary of all-out efforts to enforce party discipline,” he wrote in 2017.  Mass protests erupted in June in Hong Kong over an extradition bill that would have allowed individuals to be sent for trial to the mainland, where justice is controlled by the Communist Party.   Though the bill was withdrawn, protests have continued over a broad perception that Beijing is meddling improperly in city affairs and complaints of police brutality.  Lam said in a statement on Saturday that the Liaison Office would continue under Luo’s leadership to work with the Hong Kong government for the “positive development” of the relationship between the mainland and Hong Kong.  She added that Luo’s predecessor had provided “staunch support” to the Hong Kong government’s efforts to curb violence and uphold the rule of law during the unrest of recent months.  	Reuters

Hong Kong is the bank’s single most important market, accounting for just over half of its $12.5 billion pre-tax profits in the first half of 2019, though with the protests tipping Hong Kong’s economy into recession, HSBC and its peers are expected to take a financial hit.   Until now, HSBC had largely escaped direct involvement in the often-violent anti-government protests that have shaken Hong Kong for more than six months even as other companies with perceived links to Beijing have seen premises vandalized, including Bank of China (Hong Kong) (2388.HK), Hong Kong’s second largest bank behind HSBC.   But more recently, HSBC has drawn the ire of some protesters who accuse it of being complicit in action by the authorities against activists trying to raise money to support their campaign.  Protesters link the bank’s closure in November of an account held by a group called Spark Alliance, which helps pay protesters’ legal costs, to the December arrest of four Spark Alliance members on money laundering charges.   HSBC has strongly denied any connection.      “People are angry because they feel that HSBC has stopped money getting to the protesters,” one protester said on Wednesday, of the decision to close the account as he stood in a group taking photos of the damaged lions.   HSBC said in a statement after the arrests that the decision to close the account was “in accordance to international regulatory standards”.  “Our decision is completely unrelated to the Hong Kong Police’s arrest of the four individuals on 19 December 2019. We closed the account in November 2019 following direct instruction from the customer,” the bank said.  It is highly unusual for HSBC to comment on individual cases.  Two HSBC branches and seven indoor ATM clusters were closed on Thursday, the first working day of the year.   Some had their windows smashed and “support Spark Alliance” was spray painted on their walls during a New Year’s Day anti-government protest march. Others were damaged during protests on Christmas Eve.   The two lions were daubed with graffiti and briefly set alight after being doused in a flammable liquid.  HSBC said on Thursday initial cleaning of the lions had begun.   “We are engaging conservation experts to advise us on the professional restoration required and the process can take time,” the bank said in a statement.   More than 90% of the $4.4 billion generated by HSBC’s retail banking and wealth management unit in the six months to last June, came from Hong Kong.  HSBC has also deployed billions of dollars in China’s southern Pearl River Delta region, adjacent to Hong Kong, and has expanded its services in the world’s second largest economy.  Some analysts believe HSBC executives will have to explain their Hong Kong strategy when they discuss annual results on Feb. 18.  John Cronin, an analyst with Goodbody, said he expects to hear about a push to grow in other Asian nations, especially emerging markets, as unrest in Hong Kong continues.  “Even putting aside the political turmoil in Hong Kong, HSBC’s dependence on Hong Kong for profitability is something I expect that management will seek to tackle,” Cronin told Reuters.   Beijing plans to integrate the Pearl River Delta and Hong Kong and Macau to create an economic powerhouse under its Greater Bay Area Initiative.   HSBC’s entanglement in the protests underlines the tightrope that companies have had to walk since the protests got going in June in response to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.  The demonstrations have evolved into a broad pro-democracy movement.  “Clearly, there is a fine line for management to draw between customers and the Chinese authorities,” said a head of corporate governance at a UK-based asset manager and HSBC shareholder.  Other Hong Kong companies have been damaged by being perceived to be too supportive of the protests.  Cathay Pacific Airways (0293.HK) was forced by Beijing to suspend staff involved in the protests, and chief executive Rupert Hogg and his top deputy resigned in August amid the turmoil.   HSBC has previously been targeted by supporters of Beijing.  Users of China’s Weibo social media platform shared screenshots last year of an HSBC employee’s Facebook posts supporting the protests. The posts urged readers to complain to HSBC management.   “Businesses now have to consider how three different groups will react to their decisions: The Chinese government, Hong Kong protesters, and Chinese consumers,” said Kent Kedl, head of Control Risks’ Greater China practice.

55	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1Z108L	January 2, 2020 /  6:09 AM / 3 months ago	Exclusive: China halts British stock link over political tensions - sources	HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - China has temporarily blocked planned cross-border listings between the Shanghai and London stock exchanges because of political tensions with Britain, five sources told Reuters.  Suspending the Shanghai-London Stock Connect scheme casts a shadow over the future of a project meant to build ties between Britain and China, help Chinese firms expand their investor base and give mainland investors access to UK-listed companies.  The sources, who include public officials and people working on potential Shanghai-London deals, all said that politics was behind the suspension.   Two of them highlighted Britain’s stance over the Hong Kong protests and one pointed to remarks over the detention of a now former staff member at its consulate in Hong Kong.  All five sources have been involved in talks with Chinese officials and spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak about the matter publicly.   British companies and banks involved in the scheme are watching closely how recently-elected Prime Minister Boris Johnson approaches relations with Beijing and what stance he takes on Hong Kong, which has been roiled by protests.  China blames the Hong Kong unrest, heavily supported by an anti-government movement seeking to curb controls by Beijing, on interference by foreign governments including the United States and Britain.  The China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Shanghai Stock Exchange did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the London Stock Exchange (LSE.L) and a spokeswoman for the UK’s finance ministry declined to comment.   China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a faxed statement that it is not aware of the specifics, but added that it “hopes the UK can provide a fair and unbiased business environment for Chinese companies that invest in the UK and create the appropriate conditions for both countries to carry out practical cooperation smoothly in various fields”.   Stock Connect, which began operating last year, was devised as a way of improving Britain’s relationship with the world’s second biggest economy and was seen as a major step by China to open up its capital markets as well as linking them globally.   Huatai Securities was the first Chinese company to use the scheme in May, with SDIC Power set to become the second in December with a listing of global depository receipts (GDRs) in London representing 10% of its share capital.  However, the alternative energy operator’s deal was postponed at an advanced stage, with SDIC Power citing market conditions as the main reason.   Five sources told Reuters SDIC Power’s deal was halted because of Beijing’s suspension of Stock Connect.   Other hopefuls such as China Pacific Insurance, which one of the sources said could have launched a deal as early as the first quarter of 2020, have also been told to put their cross-border listing plans on ice, they added.        SDIC Power and China Pacific Insurance did not respond to requests for comment.   “It’s not only a big blow to the companies looking to broaden the investor base via listings in London, but also to China’s links with global markets,” one source, who has worked on one of the GDR deals, told Reuters.  Trouble with the scheme comes at a bad time for Britain, which is keen to build ties with non-European Union countries as it prepares to leave the bloc, and the LSE.   The London exchange was set for its worst year in terms of new listings in a decade as of Dec. 4, Refinitiv data showed, with political volatility and concerns over Britain’s EU divorce crimping stock market fundraisings.

59	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1YZ0VK	December 31, 2019 /  12:46 PM / 3 months ago	Exclusive: Hong Kongers support protester demands; minority wants independence from China - Reuters poll	HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong’s protest movement is supported by 59% of city residents polled in a survey conducted for Reuters by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, with more than a third of respondents saying they had attended an anti-government demonstration.  Supporters of the protests outnumbered opponents by a ratio of nearly two to one, with 30% percent saying they were opposed. Of those polled, 57% said they favored the resignation of Carrie Lam, the city’s leader. Lam was a particular target of the anti-government demonstrations that gripped Hong Kong for most of 2019 after she attempted to push through a deeply unpopular extradition bill.  Nevertheless, only 17% expressed support for seeking independence from China, and 20% were opposed to “the current path of one country, two systems” - the arrangement under which Hong Kong is governed by Beijing.   Many protesters say Beijing has used its authority under the system to gradually undermine certain freedoms - such as an independent judiciary and freedom of speech - that are supposed to be guaranteed at least until 2047 under the arrangement.   The results of the survey, involving 1,021 people and conducted from Dec. 17-20, also showed a large plurality of respondents mainly blamed the Hong Kong government for the crisis, the worst civil unrest to hit the city in decades, rather than the central government in Beijing.  “The figures are consistent with Carrie Lam’s low popularity rate, which shows her ability to lead the government is very low,” said Ma Ngok, a professor of government and public administration at Chinese University of Hong Kong. “Resistance and protests will continue next year.”  A Hong Kong government spokesman said in a response to the poll results that Lam and her team would “continue to engage the people through dialogue”.  China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office under the State Council, or cabinet, did not respond to a request for comment.   The protests erupted following an attempt by the Hong Kong government to introduce a bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial in courts that are controlled by the Communist Party.  The bill was later withdrawn, but the protests have escalated into a broader call for greater democratic representation in the city and an inquiry into alleged police brutality in dealing with the protests.  The results of the poll reinforce claims by protesters that their key demands are broadly backed by the general public, according to Samson Yuen, a political science professor at Lingnan University. They also counter Beijing’s characterization of the protests as a movement aimed at undermining its sovereignty over the city.   The poll conducted for Reuters also shows little public support for the denunciations of China by hardline protesters, some of whom have called for independence for Hong Kong or scrapping the “one country, two systems” model.  “People go on the street due to their dissatisfaction with police and the political system, not asking for independence,” Yuen said.  The survey was the first in a series commissioned by Reuters to gauge public sentiment in Hong Kong amid its worst political crisis in decades. The Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute is an independent polling firm.  Among the key findings:  — 57% of respondents said they wanted Lam to resign.  — 37% of respondents said they had taken part in protests in 2019, versus 63% who had not.   — 47% said the Hong Kong government deserved most of the blame for the unrest in the city, 14% blamed the pro-democracy camp the most, and 12% mainly blamed the central government in Beijing.   — 41% of respondents said they “strongly oppose” Hong Kong independence, and 26% said they “somewhat oppose” it. Only 8% said they “strongly support” independence, and 9% “somewhat support” it.  — 74% said they wanted an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality in handling the protests. Only 9% said the police deserved most of the blame for the unrest.  The Hong Kong government has rejected calls by protesters and opposition politicians to set up an independent inquiry into police actions, saying that its oversight of the force is adequate.  The people of Hong Kong “are not seeking a quick fix”, said Yuen, the Lingnan University professor. “They think Carrie Lam should be held accountable but it’s not the most important thing. They want an independent inquiry to improve the relationship between police and people.”  The Hong Kong police did not respond to a request for comment.  Many protesters say they are incensed by what they see as an abuse of power by the police in dealing with the unrest. The police say they have used reasonable and appropriate force against illegal acts including vandalism and rioting.   Since Hong Kong reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997, many people in the city of 7.5 million have become increasingly angered by what they see as efforts by China to undermine the city’s autonomy and roll back freedoms.  When asked whether Hong Kong should keep on its “current path” of one country, two systems, 39% of respondents said they “strongly support” the model, and 29% said they “somewhat support” it.  China has denounced acts of violence in the protests, which it sees as being aimed at undermining Chinese sovereignty.  The large number of respondents saying they had participated in a protest chime with the huge demonstrations the city saw in 2019. On June 9, an anti-extradition march drew an estimated one million people; that was followed a week later by an even larger demonstration.  Widespread discontent was also reflected in city-wide  elections for district council seats on Nov. 24, in which pro-democracy candidates won nearly 90% of the 450 seats. While voter participation is usually low in elections for the councils, which oversee things like garbage collection, nearly three million people in the city voted in the November election, or 71% of registered voters. It was the highest turnout in Hong Kong electoral history.  The degree of support for the protests varied sharply by age, education and whether respondents were born in Hong Kong. Younger, better-educated people born in Hong Kong, for example, were far more likely to support or take part in the protests, the poll showed.  For the poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points, respondents were randomly polled by telephone in Cantonese, which is spoken by the vast majority of people in Hong Kong. The results were weighted according to the latest population figures in Hong Kong.   	Reuters

The move touched a raw nerve, with many in the liberal, free-wheeling financial hub fearing an erosion of Hong Kong’s judicial independence and individual rights, amid fears individuals wouldn’t be guaranteed a fair trial.  The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with promises that its autonomy and freedoms were guaranteed. But in recent years, many have been angered by a perceived tightening grip by China. The extradition law was seen as a final straw.  The first protests flared in March and April and snowballed. On June 9, an estimated one million people took to the streets. The city’s Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, suspended the extradition bill on June 14 but this didn’t pacify the protesters who wanted it to be scrapped entirely.  A protester holding up an anti-extradition bill banner fell from the roof of a luxury mall and died. Protesters consider this to be the first death of the movement during a demonstration.  On July 1, anti-government protesters held a mass march, after which they stormed the legislature. Hardline activists rampaged through the building, smashing furniture and spray-painting walls and the coat of arms.  The unprecedented attack marked a turning point from a peaceful, 79-day pro-democracy street sit-in in 2014 that had achieved nothing. Young protesters would use violence more often in a bid to exert more pressure on the city government, trashing government buildings, shopping malls and metro stations.  As the arrests of protesters began to mount, some began using petrol bombs to slow police advances on the crowds and to allow people time to escape.  The violence in one of the safest major cities in the world was becoming more regular. Police countered petrol bombs and rocks with tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and eventually the occasional live round. A water cannon was deployed by police for the first time in the industrial New Territories town of Tsuen Wan on Aug. 25.  Weekend after weekend, streets of the city, in different places but often in the up-market Central business area and the Causeway Bay shopping district, would become a sea of flames. Tear gas billowed between the high-rises as sirens wailed on some of the most densely populated streets on Earth.  There were several injuries but no deaths from direct police fire.  Protesters were now railing against perceived police brutality that helped fuel public anger and protest turnouts.   After nearly two months of upheaval, with the protests now morphing into a fully-fledged anti-government movement with five key demands, including full democracy, the protesters turned their attention to the airport, one of Asia’s most spectacular aviation hubs, built by the British in the dying days of colonial rule and reached by a series of gleaming bridges.  Thousands of protesters staged a sit-in inside the arrivals hall that led to the airport shutting down for several days. The move garnered international headlines with the travel plans of thousands of foreign nationals thrown into disarray.  The protests kept up their momentum, week after week, until Hong Kong’s leader eventually formally withdrew the detested extradition bill on Sept. 4.  But many protesters said it was too little, too late.  They continued to press their other demands, including an amnesty for the thousands already arrested and an independent investigation into alleged police brutality.  Tension was also building between protesters and pro-Beijing residents, including those in one of the “reddest” pro-China districts of North Point on Hong Kong island. Chinese banks and businesses, or those perceived as being pro-Beijing, came under attack.  In mid-November, students turned several university campuses into fortresses, barricading themselves inside and clashing with riot police on the periphery. On Nov. 12, riot police at Chinese University fired more than 1,000 rounds of tear gas at protesters.   A few days later, hundreds of front-line protesters became  trapped inside Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University, at the mouth of the now-closed Cross-Harbour Tunnel on the Kowloon side of the water. They manufactured an arsenal of petrol bombs and practised firing bows and arrows in the half-empty swimming pool as police blocked the exits.  The protesters battled riot police for several intense days amid fears of a bloody clampdown. In the end, hundreds of arrests were made, while scores of protesters resorted to desperate means to escape, including rappelling off bridges on ropes and hopping on to the backs of motorbikes and even trying to swim out through the sewers.    After the siege of PolyU, Hong Kong held a city-wide election on Nov. 24 that pro-democracy candidates won in a landslide with a record-high turnout.  Democrats seized nearly 90 percent of the nearly 450 seats on offer. A mass year-end march on Hong Kong island also drew an estimated 800,000 people showing continued public support.  The crisis has not only shaken Hong Kong, but posed one of the gravest populist challenges to Chinese President Xi Jinping, with some protesters calling for outright independence from China.  China denies interfering in Hong Kong’s affairs and blames the unrest on the West, specifically the United States and Britain. It has backed Hong Kong leader Lam in her efforts to quell the violence but says it will not tolerate any threat to Chinese sovereignty.  China’s People’s Liberation Army garrison in the territory has stayed in barracks since the handover in 1997. It has beefed up its numbers in the city amid the unrest and troops also helped clear protester barricades outside a barracks in November.  China has warned that any attempt at independence will be crushed.  Hong Kong's fiery protests in pictures: reut.rs/2PNZ4zZ 	Reuters

Dozens of police marched across a public square overlooking Hong Kong’s harbor to face off with protesters who hurled glass bottles and rocks at them.  Earlier in the afternoon more than 1,000 people had rallied calmly, waving Uighur flags and posters, as they took part in the latest demonstration in over six months of unrest.  A mixed crowd of young and elderly people, dressed in black and wearing masks to shield their identities, held up signs reading “Free Uyghur, Free Hong Kong” and “Fake ‘autonomy’ in China results in genocide”.  The protest comes after midfielder Mesut Ozil of English soccer club Arsenal caused a furor in China after he criticized the country’s policies toward the Muslim ethnic minority in the restive northwestern region of Xinjiang.  Ozil, a German Muslim of Turkish origin, tweeted that Uighurs were “warriors who resist persecution” and criticized both China’s strong hand in Xinjiang and the relative silence of Muslims in response.  “I think basic freedom and independence should exist for all people, not just for Hong Kong,” said a 41-year-old woman surnamed Wong who attended the protest with her husband.  United Nations experts and activists say at least 1 million Uighurs and members of other largely Muslim minority groups have been detained in camps in Xinjiang since 2017 under a campaign that has been condemned by the United States and other countries.   Beijing says it is providing vocational training to help stamp out separatism and to teach new skills. It denies any mistreatment of Uighurs.  Protests in Hong Kong are now in their seventh month, albeit in a relative year-end lull. Many residents are angry at what they see as Chinese meddling in the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  China denies interfering and says it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula put in place at that time and has blamed foreign forces for fomenting unrest.  On Saturday, Hong Kong riot police swept into several shopping malls, chasing off and arresting demonstrators pressing their demands in the peak shopping weekend before Christmas.  The police’s heavy-handed clamp-down on demonstrations and frequent use of tear gas have incensed many protesters, whose demands include full democracy and an independent investigation into perceived police brutality.  The protests, which started in June, have pushed Hong Kong’s economy into recession. Retailers and businesses have been hit hard as tourists stay away amid transport disruptions.  The city’s Financial Secretary Paul Chan, in his blog on Sunday, said there could be a wave of business closures in the new year if market conditions do not improve.  “Many companies are now clenching their teeth and struggling to maintain their businesses,” he said, adding that he hoped the violence would stop.

64	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1YP02E	December 21, 2019 /  3:00 AM / 3 months ago	Hong Kong protesters face off with police in mall protests	HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong riot police swept into several shopping malls on Saturday, chasing off and arresting some anti-government Hong Kong demonstrators who had gathered to press their demands in the peak shopping weekend before Christmas.  In a mall in Yuen Long, close to the China border, hundreds of black-clad protesters marked the five-month anniversary of an attack in a train station by an armed mob wearing white T-shirts which beat up bystanders and protesters with pipes and poles.   Police have been criticized for not responding quickly enough to calls for help, and for not arresting any alleged culprits at the scene. They later made several arrests and said the assailants had links to organized criminal gangs, or triads.  The protesters demanded justice for the attack, shouting “Fight for Freedom” and “Stand With Hong Kong”.  “The government didn’t do anything so far after 5 months ... I deserve an answer, an explanation,” said a 30-year-old clerk surnamed Law.  “Yuen Long is no longer a safe place ... and we all live in white terror when we worry if we will be beaten up when dressed in black.”   As dozens of riot police stormed into the mall to chase protesters off, a sushi restaurant had its window smashed and shops were forced to close.      Protests in Hong Kong are now in their seventh month, albeit in a relative lull. Residents are angry at what they see as China’s meddling in the city’s freedoms guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.   Many are also outraged by perceived police brutality, and are demanding an independent investigation into allegations of excessive force. Other demands include the release of all arrested demonstrators and full democracy.  On Friday night, police arrested a man who fired a single shot with a pistol at plain clothes officers in the northern Tai Po district. No one was injured.   A search of a nearby flat revealed a cache of weaponry including a semi-automatic rifle and bullets. Steve Li, a senior police officer on the scene, told reporters the police had information that the suspect planned to use the pistol during a protest to “cause chaos and to hurt police officers.”  In Tsim Sha Tsui on Saturday, groups of protesters also converged on a mall popular with mainland Chinese luxury shoppers.  “We can’t celebrate Christmas when our city is taken over by the police. When you see the police outside the mall, do you feel like shopping for presents?” said Bob, 17, a protester. 	Reuters

The Twitter boss banned political ads and did more than Mark Zuckerberg to prevent the silencing of Hong Kong protesters. Dorsey, who also runs payments firm Square, fared surprisingly well in Washington hearings, too. His style will turn him into the anti-Facebook hero.  Dorsey is an unlikely political darling. He comes across as awkward and soft-spoken. But he has also been more up-front with U.S. lawmakers than his social-media rivals about toxic content and his platform’s confusing terms of use. It’s a contrast with both Zuckerberg’s tin-eared talking points and the technical wonkiness of Sundar Pichai, who now runs Alphabet as well as its biggest business, Google.  Twitter has also been more decisive than rivals about resolving controversies, including political ads. While Facebook and Google’s YouTube are tying themselves in knots over restrictions, Dorsey in October announced Twitter was simply banning political ads altogether. While President Donald Trump’s campaign manager criticized the decision, it hasn’t sparked much blowback from other Republicans and it drew applause from Democrats.  That move followed another politically popular decision on Hong Kong. In August, Twitter decided to stop running ads from state-controlled media entities, including Beijing-backed outlets. Facebook, which generated about $5 billion in revenue from Chinese advertisers in 2018 according to Pivotal Research, has run Xinhua ads about this year’s protests in Hong Kong, while YouTube hosted similar China Global Television Network shows.  Square, meanwhile, has been building its cryptocurrency capabilities without drawing political backlash, whereas Facebook has put its Libra digital-currency project on hold after a global regulatory outcry.  Political pressure on social networks will increase as the November 2020 presidential election approaches. Dorsey may find he has earned a third important job as a thorn in the side of his larger, more compromised rivals.  That’s if he’s even around: After a trip to Africa in November he tweeted that he would spend three to six months living there in 2020. There are opportunities for Square in African markets, but Dorsey’s absence could hurt Twitter if it gets caught in an election firestorm. That said, a move to another continent is one way to get a breather from an interminable, and probably nasty, campaign.  This is a Breakingviews prediction for 2020.

Congregating outside a detention center in the western Kowloon district of Lai Chi Kok, the crowds held up signs with the words “In Solidarity We Stand”, waved flags and demanded the release of all protesters.  “I feel quite sad for the young people, they are fighting for liberty...for us all,” said Ben, a 68-year-old retiree.   After a relative lull in sometimes violent protests that have gripped the former British colony over the past six months, some protesters were alarmed by police moves to freeze HK$70 million ($9 million) in bank deposits held by fund-raiser Spark Alliance.  The protesters are angry at perceived Chinese meddling in the city’s freedoms guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies the charge.  Police said one man fired a pistol at them in the New Territories town of Tai Po, but did not say if it was protest related.

Spark Alliance was launched in 2016 to support protesters on a number of fronts including legal fees. Police said they arrested three men and one woman for suspected “money laundering”, according to a statement.   Spark Alliance on its Facebook page said it “condemned such smear tactics” by the police.   Pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo, who was also at the protest, said the police case was tenuous at best, and she questioned why the fund had run for several years without incident.  “It’s too convenient for the authorities to call it money laundering,” she said.   Global banking group HSBC (HSBA.L) (0005.HK) on Friday strongly denied any link between the police clampdown on Spark Alliance and the earlier closure of an HSBC bank account tied to the group.

Congregating outside a detention center in the western Kowloon district of Lai Chi Kok, the crowds held up signs with the words “In Solidarity We Stand”, waved flags and demanded the release of all protesters.  “I feel quite sad for the young people, they are fighting for liberty...for us all,” said Ben, a 68-year-old retiree.   After a relative lull in sometimes violent protests that have gripped the former British colony over the past six months, some protesters were alarmed by police moves to freeze HK$70 million ($9 million) in bank deposits held by fund-raiser Spark Alliance.  The protesters are angry at perceived Chinese meddling in the city’s freedoms guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies the charge.  Police said one man fired a pistol at them in the New Territories town of Tai Po, but did not say if it was protest related.

It is an exciting and important event for our global newsroom.  Donald Trump, the Republican president running for a second term, has changed the way politics work in the U.S. and the world over. He has also redefined the United States’ relationship with many allies and rivals – China, Israel, France, Iran, Turkey, North Korea to name a few. This is a development that our bureaus worldwide have chronicled with breadth and sophistication over the past three years.   The Democratic field is bigger and more diverse than usual. The party is split between moderates and candidates who would pull the country to the left. A Democratic victory is likely to again reset America’s relationship with the rest of the world.  And just as the United States is changing, politics and societies elsewhere are polarizing – some of them charting their own course and some no doubt influenced by the most powerful nation in the world. Hong Kong’s protests for greater autonomy from China rage on. Last week, Britain voted resoundingly for a leader who will finally lead the country out of the European Union, in a vote capping three years of political and societal strife after British voters first opted for Brexit.  All this to say that the U.S. election will be closely watched within – and without – U.S. borders.  So WHAT will we cover? Led by Soyoung Kim, our 2020 U.S. election editor, and North America Editor Kieran Murray, our coverage will be divided into five broad areas:  The Election Explained: Electing a new president in the United States is a long and complicated process. From our unique position as the world’s most global news organization, we will explain events for the world, deciphering the process and the players through interactive graphics, factboxes, explainers and newsmakers. Our Key Dates Election Calendar and our Guide to the Primaries (here and here) are two early such features.  The Big Issues: We aim to cut through the fog of spin, conjecture and tweets to focus on substantive and unbiased coverage of what matters in people’s lives.  In terms of election themes, this means the economy, immigration, climate change, the effects of the trade war with China and the upcoming U.S. Census. We will also examine the possibility that cyber-interference and disinformation campaigns could affect how people vote.  The Race: In covering the race’s main stages – the caucuses, the primaries, the conventions and election-day voting – we will mount a massive multimedia effort aimed at chronicling the moments and the people involved. This effort will include camera crews and photographers traveling with candidates; live video and interviews at rallies; and speeches around big events.  Washington and the World: We have a unique ability to showcase and interpret what decisions made in D.C. mean for the rest of the world. Since Trump levied the first tariff against China, we have focused our coverage of the global trade war on the impact on industries and people – from the change in farming habits in the U.S. to the rethinking of automotive supply chains in Asia and dietary habits in China. Our team of global journalists also have illuminated the ways that Trump’s policies have emboldened authoritarian world leaders such as Vladimir Putin, Tayyip Erdogan, Mohammed bin Salman, Jair Bolsonaro and Benjamin Netanyahu while alienating traditional NATO allies. How Trump’s friends and foes engage with the White House, leading Democratic presidential candidates and the ultimate nominee, will be a key pillar of our 2020 reporting effort.  Polling: Our polling effort will stand out. It will include weekly surveys of public opinion and of battleground states; targeted surveys of top election issues and political engagement broken down by each demographic; two different polls on election day: one from the National Election Poll (NEP) that is supervised by a consortium of U.S. news organizations including Reuters, and the other in conjunction with Ipsos.  Of course, many other news organizations will have comprehensive and insightful coverage. That makes HOW we will cover the election important.   Shortly after President Trump was elected, Reuters Editor-in-Chief Steve Adler laid out how Reuters would cover the new administration, namely that Reuters would follow the same Trust Principles-driven approach that governs our work in more than 200 locations around the world, including in many where the media is frequently under attack. This mission, Steve wrote, includes focusing on issues that will make a difference in the businesses and lives of our readers and viewers; not picking unnecessary fights or making the story about us; and operating with impartiality and calm integrity.  From our early world-beating coverage of the extreme vetting policies introduced by Trump, which affected hundreds of thousands around the world, to the trade war’s impact on farmers and steelworkers in the Midwest, we have stuck to this formula. It’s worth rereading Steve’s note from January 2017.  Reuters was ranked No. 1 in accuracy in an Economist study this year and tracked nearly dead center in measuring bias, showing neither left nor right-wing favoritism. Amid the polarization of politics and news, we must work hard to uphold this reputation. In covering the 2020 U.S. Election, that means providing coverage that is fair, independent, impartial and relevant – in short covering it The Reuters Way.

71	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1YN0S5	December 19, 2019 /  7:57 AM / 4 months ago	Hong Kong protesters seek international support on rights	HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong protesters rallied outside diplomatic missions on Thursday to urge foreign governments to follow the United States and pass human rights bills to raise pressure on Beijing and support their pro-democracy campaign.  U.S. President Donald Trump signed legislation last month requiring the State Department to certify, at least once a year, that Hong Kong retains enough autonomy from Beijing to justify favorable U.S. trading terms.  About 1,000 people, most of them dressed in black and wearing face masks, marched on a route that took them by the consulates of Australia, Britain, the European Union, the United States, Japan and Canada, to drop off a petition.  British, EU and U.S. diplomats came out to receive it and took photographs with the protesters.  “What happens in Hong Kong is not just a local issue, it is about human rights and democracy. Foreign governments should understand how this city is being suppressed,” said Suki Chan, who participated in the protest.  “We need to continue to seek international attention and let them know this movement is not losing momentum.”  Hong Kong has been rattled for more than six months by anti-government protests amid growing anger over what many see as Chinese meddling in the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  Beijing has denied such meddling, blaming the unrest on “foreign forces” and saying attempts to interfere in the city are doomed to fail.   The U.S. legislation, which also threatens sanctions for human rights violations, followed similar “citizen diplomacy” petitions in Hong Kong this year and has been cheered by protesters.  Beijing denounced the U.S. legislation and Hong Kong’s government said it sent the wrong signal to the demonstrators and increased economic uncertainty in Hong Kong, a major financial hub.  The marchers’ petition condemned what it called police brutality and urged governments to pass legislation to punish Chinese and Hong Kong officials by denying them visas and freezing their assets.  The police say they have acted with restraint.   Police said separately on Thursday they had arrested four people suspected of money laundering in relation to the protests and had frozen HK$70 million ($9 million) in bank deposits.  Chan Wai Kei, from the police’s financial investigation and narcotics bureau, told reporters the four were part of a group that had asked for donations for arrested and injured protesters but used some of the money for personal investments.  Beijing says it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula that guarantees a high degree of autonomy.  Chinese President Xi Jinping has this week visited the neighboring gambling hub of Macau, a former Portuguese colony, which he praised on Thursday, drawing a contrast with the Hong Kong protests.  “Love China, love Macau has become the core value of the whole society,” Xi told local officials.   The Macau government and “all parts of society deeply understand that harmony leads to prosperity, (and the importance of) unity, negotiation, no argument, no internal conflict, resisting external interference.”  On Friday Xi was due to attend ceremonies for the 20th anniversary of Macau’s handover to China, and was expected to announce economic perks as a reward for its stability and loyalty.  At the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong, protesters called for U.S. Congress to pass a “Be Water Act”, legislation championed by Missouri Senator Josh Hawley and named after a protest slogan borrowed from martial arts legend Bruce Lee.   The bill would freeze assets of Chinese nationals and state-owned enterprises believed to have contributed to suppressing freedom of speech in Hong Kong.  Thursday also marked the 35th anniversary of a treaty between China and Britain on Hong Kong’s future, which set the stage for its handover.  British Foreign secretary Dominic Raab urged China in a statement to open dialogue with the protesters and respect the commitments in the treaty.  The Chinese foreign ministry said in 2017 the 1984 joint declaration, signed by then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang, was a historical document that no longer had any practical significance.  Hong Kong’s special status, which helped it grow into a global financial center and avoid U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, is important to Beijing, which uses the city as its main gateway to global capital.

The treaty signed on Dec. 19, 1984 pledged that Hong Kong’s high-degree of autonomy would be unchanged for 50 years after the former British colony was handed back to China in 1997.  But fears China may start to clamp down have led to months of often violent street protests in the territory.  “Hong Kong is experiencing its greatest period of turmoil since the handover,” British Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement.  “The agreement between the UK and China made clear that Hong Kong’s high-degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms would remain unchanged for 50 years,” he added.  “The undertakings made by China, including the right to freedom of expression, an independent judiciary and the rule of law are essential to Hong Kong’s prosperity and way of life.”  Raab said Britain took those commitments seriously.  He added: “The only way to guarantee Hong Kong’s future success and stability is by respecting these and addressing the legitimate concerns of the people of Hong Kong through meaningful political dialogue.” 	Reuters

The girl, who set fire to the flag at an anti-Beijing rally in September, pleaded guilty to desecrating the flag, RTHK said. Hong Kong has outlawed the desecration of national flags and emblems, crimes that attract jail terms of three years.  While Chinese authorities have striven to foster greater patriotism among citizens in the former British colony, they have met a backlash from protesters who accuse Beijing of encroaching on the freedoms promised to Hong Kong when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  The city, a major hub of global finance, has been rocked by six months of often violent demonstrations against a now-withdrawn extradition bill that widened into demands for more democratic freedoms.  The girl’s lawyer submitted letters from her secondary school and her football coach urging the court to give her a second chance, RTHK said.  The magistrate told the girl not to expect a lenient sentence if she committed a more serious offence next time, the broadcaster said.  Young people and teenagers have been at the forefront of the Hong Kong protests. Since June, police have arrested people as young as 11 and as old as 84 in connection with the protests.   The protests have regularly featured ranks of riot police firing volleys of tear gas or baton-charging protesters, often in central business or tourist areas. Police in turn have been targets of petrol bombs and other projectiles hurled by often masked protesters.  There have been widespread allegations of police misconduct during the protests. Police have described their actions as reactive and restrained. 	Reuters

The marches and protests, the standoffs with police, the lies to her parents. They’d all built on top of her old existence until she found herself, now, dressed in black, her face wrapped with a homemade balaclava that left only her eyes and a pale strip of skin visible. Her small hands were stained red.  It was just paint, she said, as she funneled liquid into balloons. The air around her stank of lighter fluid. Teenagers hurled Molotov cocktails toward police. Lines of archers roamed the grounds of the university they’d seized; now and then, they stopped to release metal-tipped arrows into the darkness, let fly with the hopes of finding the flesh of a cop.  Down below Fiona, rows of police flanked an intersection. Within a stone’s throw, Chinese soldiers stood in riot gear behind the gates of an outpost of the People’s Liberation Army, one of the most powerful militaries on the planet.  Fiona joined her first march on June 9, a schoolgirl making her way to the city’s financial district on a sunny day as people called out for freedom. It was now November 16, and she was one of more than 1,000 protesters swarming around and barricaded inside Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Because of their young age and the danger of arrest, Reuters is withholding the full names of Fiona and her comrades.  Night was falling. They were wild and free with their violence, but on the verge of being surrounded and pinned down.  The kids, which is what most of them were, buzzed back and forth like hornets, cleaning glass bottles at one station, filling them with lighter fluid and oil in another. An empty swimming pool was commandeered to practice flinging the Molotov cocktails, leaving burn marks skidded everywhere.  When front-line decisions needed to be made, clumps of protesters came together to form a jittering black nest – almost everyone was dressed from hood to mask to pants in black – yelling about whether to charge or pull back.  They were becoming something different from what they were, a metamorphosis that would have been difficult to imagine in orderly Hong Kong, a city where you line up neatly for an elevator door and crowds don’t step into an empty street until the signal changes. With each slap up against the police, each scramble down the subway stairs to avoid arrest as tear gas ate at their eyes, they hardened. They shifted back and forth between their old lives and their new – school uniforms and dinners with mom and dad, then pulling the masks over their faces once more. It was a dangerous balance.  “We may all be killed by the police. Yes,” said Fiona.  At the crucible of Polytechnic University, Fiona and the others crossed a line. Their movement has embraced the slogan of “be water,” of pushing forward with dramatic action and then pulling back suddenly, but here, the protesters hunkered down, holding a large chunk of territory in the middle of Hong Kong. In their hive of enraged adolescence, they were risking everything for a tomorrow that almost certainly won’t come – a Hong Kong that cleaves greater freedom from an increasingly powerful Chinese Communist Party.  In doing so, Fiona found moments bigger than what her life was before. “We call the experience of protest, like at PolyU, a dream,” she later explained.  But to speak of such things out loud, without the mask that she hid behind, without the throbbing crowds that made it seem within reach, is not possible outside, in the real Hong Kong.  The protesters have left traces of their hopes, confessions and fears across the city, in graffiti scrawled on bank buildings and bus stops alike. One line that’s appeared: “There may be no winners in this revolution but please stay to bear witness.”  The impact of Hong Kong’s protests, as they pass the half-year mark, is this: Kids with rocks and bottles have fought their way to the sharp edge between two nation states expected to shape the 21st century.  The street unrest resembles an ongoing brawl between police and the young men and women in black. Police have fired about 16,000 rounds of tear gas and 10,000 rubber bullets. Since June, they’ve rounded up people from the ages of 11 to 84, making more than 6,000 arrests. About 500 officers have been wounded in the melee.  Hong Kong’s police officials have said all along that their operations are guided by a desire to maintain public order, rejecting accusations they use excessive force. They issued a plea as recently as Thursday, saying, “If rioters don’t use violence, Hong Kong will be safe and there’s no reason for us to use force.”  After the U.S. Congress was galvanized by the plight of the protesters, it passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which President Donald Trump signed last month. The law subjects Hong Kong to review by the U.S. State Department, at least once a year, on whether the city has clung to enough autonomy from Beijing to continue receiving favorable trading terms from America. It also provides for sanctions, including visa bans and asset freezes, against officials responsible for human rights violations in Hong Kong.  The protesters were delighted, carrying American flags and singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” in the streets of Hong Kong. Beijing was furious. China has had sovereignty over Hong Kong since the British handed it over in 1997. The Chinese government quickly banned U.S. military ships from docking in Hong Kong, a traditional port of call in the region.  The protesters, including many as young as Fiona, had changed the course of aircraft carriers and guided-missile destroyers.  Chinese state media describe the unrest as the work of “rioters” and “radicals,” accusing foreign governments of fanning anti-China sentiment in the city. Beijing’s top diplomat has demanded that Washington “stop interfering in China’s internal affairs.”  The stakes for the kids of Hong Kong go well beyond a moment of geopolitical standoff. When Britain passed the city to China, like a pearl slipping from the hand of one merchant to another, there was a written understanding that for 50 years Hong Kong would enjoy a great deal of autonomy. Known as “one country, two systems,” the agreement suspended some of the blow of a global finance center coming under the rule of the Chinese Communist Party. The deal expires in 2047. For Fiona, this means that in her lifetime she will live not in the freewheeling city to which she was born, but, quite possibly, in a place that’s just another dot on the map of China.  Chants at marches revolve around five protester demands, such as universal suffrage, with “Not one less!” the automatic refrain. But conversations soon turn to a larger, more difficult topic at the root of their complaints. China.  During interviews with more than a dozen protesters at Polytechnic and another university besieged at the same time, and continued contact with many of them in the weeks that followed, the subject sprang up repeatedly. It’s never far, they said, the shadow of Beijing over the Hong Kong government’s policies.  “They’re all involved with this shit,” said Lee, who gave only her last name. The 20-year-old nursing student covered her mouth after the obscenity, embarrassed to have said it out loud in the middle of a cafe, and quickly continued. “Of course China is the big boss behind this.”  “If China is going to take over Hong Kong, we will lose our freedoms, we will lose our rights as humans,” she said. Police had taken down her information when she surrendered outside Polytechnic University. She didn’t yet know whether that would lead to an arrest on rioting charges, which could bring up to 10 years of prison.  “In my view, violence is the thing that protects us,” Lee said. “It is a warning to those, like the police, who think they can do anything to us.”  The acceptance of violence isn’t limited to the barricades. Joshua Wong, the global face of the movement’s lobbying efforts, said he understood the need for protesters “to defend themselves with force.”  As Wong spoke during an interview in Hong Kong on Wednesday, the headline on the front page of the South China Morning Post on the table next to his elbow read: “BOMB PLOTTERS ‘INTENDED TO TARGET POLICE AT MASS RALLY’”  If a group of protesters had indeed planned to bomb police, would that have been a step too far?  “I think the fundamental issue,” he said, “is we never can prove which strategy is the most effective or not-effective way to put pressure on Beijing.”  When Fiona first heard about a bill that would allow criminal suspects to be shipped from Hong Kong to mainland China, the initial trigger of the protests, she wasn’t concerned. It was the sort of thing that troublemakers worried about. “The extradition bill seemed good to me,” she said.  Her mother, a housewife from mainland China, is the product of a Communist education system that, as Fiona puts it, doesn’t “allow them to think about politics.” She is still unaware, for example, that there was a massacre around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1989.  Fiona’s father, from Hong Kong, drives a minibus taxi. He has concerns about creeping mainland control, but his urge to “treasure our freedom” leaves him afraid of anything that might provoke Beijing’s wrath: “He keeps saying we should not do this and we should not do that.”  They live together in a sliver of a working-class district in Kowloon, the peninsula that juts above Hong Kong island. It is a place of tiny apartments and people just trying to get by.  It was much better, everyone in her household agreed, to avoid politics.  On weekends, Fiona, who has a cartoon sticker of Cinderella on the back of her iPhone, usually went shopping with girlfriends from high school. They looked for new outfits. They chatted and had tea together.  But when Fiona saw the news that more than 3,000 Hong Kong lawyers dressed in black had marched against the proposed extradition bill on June 6, she wondered what was going on.  She clicked through YouTube on her cell phone. She stopped on a Cantonese-language video uploaded less than a week before by a young, handsome guy – hair cropped close on the sides and in a sort of thick flop on top – sitting on the edge of a bed. The video was speeded up so the presenter spoke in a fast blur, delivering on what he billed as, “Extradition bill 6 minute summary for dummies.”  The idea of the bill, on its face, wasn’t a problem, the young man said – public safety and rules are important. The issue was that the judiciary in the mainland and the judiciary in Hong Kong are two totally different things.  The Chinese Communist Party, he said, might use this new linkage between the court systems to come after ordinary people who were exercising their freedom of speech, something protected in Hong Kong but not Beijing: “You may be extradited to China because of telling a joke.”  Fiona was alarmed.  Just a few days after her YouTube awakening, on June 9, she took the subway with a group of friends from high school over to Hong Kong island. The crowd filled the march’s meeting point, Victoria Park, and soon flooded outside its boundaries. Between the glimmering towers of commerce, they yelled: “Fight for freedom! Stand with Hong Kong!” They yelled: “No China extradition! No evil law!” Fiona was astonished. She couldn’t believe so many people had shown up.  The swell of the crowd, the boom and crash of its noise, was adrenaline and inspiration – “all of us were having the same aim,” Fiona said.  The city’s leader, Beijing-backed Carrie Lam, would have to relent, Fiona thought. Faced with the will of so many citizens – a million came out that day, in a city of about 7.5 million – Lam had no choice but to meet with protesters and address their concerns.  That’s not what happened.  Three days later, the Hong Kong police shot rubber bullets and tear gas into a crowd.  On July 1, protesters wearing yellow construction hats and gauze masks stormed into the city’s Legislative Council building on the 22nd anniversary of the handover from the British. They smashed through glass doors with hammers, poles and road barriers, spray-painting the walls as the chaos churned – “HONG KONG IS NOT CHINA.”  On the night of November 16, as Fiona sat on the terrace at Polytechnic, a teenager slouched at his post on a pedestrian bridge on the other side of the school. Reaching across a highway between the back of the university and a subway stop, the bridge could be a point of entry for police, the protesters feared.  The road underneath the bridge led to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, a main artery linking Hong Kong island and the Kowloon Peninsula. The protesters had blocked that route, hoping to trigger a citywide strike. It was becoming clear that would not happen.  The teenager on the bridge, whose full name includes Pak and who sometimes goes by Paco, had the sleeves of his black Adidas windbreaker rolled up his arms. His glasses jutted out of the eye-opening of his ski mask. The 17-year-old, thick-set and volatile, recently had gotten kicked out of his house after arguing with his parents about the protests. They’re both from mainland China, Pak explained. “They always say, ‘Kill the protesters; the government is right.’”  There was a divide between him and his parents that couldn’t be crossed, he said. As a student in Hong Kong, he received a relatively liberal education at school, complete with the underpinnings of Western philosophical and political thought.  “I was born in Hong Kong. I know what is freedom. I know what is democracy. I know what is freedom of speech,” Pak said, his voice rising with each sentence.  His parents, on the other hand, were educated and raised on the mainland. His shorthand for what that meant: “You know, we should love the Party, we should love Mao Zedong, blah, blah, blah.”  In his downtime, Pak hunched over an empty green Jolly Shandy Lemon bottle and poured lighter fluid inside. He gestured to containers of cooking and peanut oil and said he added them as well because they helped the fire both burn and stick once the glass exploded.  He couldn’t count how many he’d filled in the past two days at Polytechnic. Pak was working a shift as a lookout on the bridge. He guzzled soda and coffee to stay awake, lifting his mask to slurp, revealing a round chin and an adolescent’s light dusting of hair on his upper lip. There was a mattress on the floor around the corner for quick naps. On a board leaning against the side of the walkway in front of him, a message was scrawled in capital letters: EYES OPEN!  Where did he think it was all headed? Pak put the bottle down and said he saw nothing but struggle ahead. “I think the violence of the protests will be increased; it will be upgraded,” he said. “But we have no choice.”  When Pak was 12 years old, he watched news coverage of a massive, peaceful protest in Hong Kong, the 2014 “Umbrella Revolution,” a sit-in that called for universal suffrage. The movement ended with protesters being hit by tear gas and hauled off to jail.  The nonviolent tactics, Pak said, got them nowhere.  Did he worry that the violence was taking place so near to a People’s Liberation Army barracks?  Not at all. That morning, a separate barracks in Hong Kong was in the news when some of its soldiers, in exercise shorts and T-shirts, walked out to the road carrying red buckets and helped clean up debris left by protesters near the city’s Baptist University. The event made both local and international headlines for the rarity of PLA soldiers’ appearance in public. Under the city’s mini-constitution, the Chinese military can be called by the Hong Kong government to help maintain public order, but they “shall not interfere” in local affairs.  “I think they are testing us. If we attack the PLA, the PLA can shoot us and say, ‘OK, we were defending ourselves,’” Pak said. “If we don’t attack the PLA, they will cross the line, again and again.”  But, he said, if the protesters continued ramping up violence against the cops, maybe the PLA would be called in. And that, he said, would hand the protest movement victory.  “Other countries like [the] British and America can protect human rights in Hong Kong by sending troops to protect us,” he said. It was, under any reading of the situation, a far-fetched idea. Hong Kong is by international law the domain of Beijing; the Chinese Communist Party can send in troops to clamp down on civil unrest. There’s not been a hint of any Western power being interested in intervening on the ground.  Pak was right about one thing, though. Police officers later massed on the other side of the bridge, piling out of their vehicles and walking in a long file to the head of the structure. The protesters lit the bridge ablaze. People screamed. Flames leapt. A funnel of black smoke filled the air.  The next night, Pak didn’t reply to notes sent by Telegram, the encrypted messaging app he used. A day later, he still didn’t answer notes asking where he was. The day after that, the same. Pak was gone.  The young man lay his hands down on the table. They were bandaged and his fingers curved over in an unnatural crook. He’d not been out of his family’s house much in two weeks. Tommy, 19, shredded his hands on a rope when he squeezed it hard as his body whooshed down off a bridge on the side of Polytechnic University.  They were better now, his fingers. A photograph he sent just after, on November 20, showed a deep pocket of flesh ripped from his left pinkie, close to the bone by the look of it, and skin shredded across both hands. “I didn’t wear gloves,” he explained.  After hitting the ground, he’d rushed to a line of waiting vehicles, driven by “parents” – protester slang for volunteers who show up to whisk them away from dangerous situations.  On the morning of November 18, while still inside Polytechnic, he had sent a note saying his actual parents knew he was there and he couldn’t find a way out.  “Worst case might be the police coming in polyu arresting all the people inside and beat them up,” he said in a note on Telegram, the chat platform. “I’m like holy shit and i gotta be safe and not arrested.”  That evening, he was still there. He didn’t see a way to escape. Tommy went to the “front line” to face off with the police, not far from the ledge where Fiona sat a couple nights before. Tommy carried a makeshift shield, a piece of wood and then part of a plastic road barrier, to protect himself from the blasts of a water cannon. He didn’t make it very far.  Unlike most of the protesters who were around him, Tommy is a student at Polytechnic. He has worked hard to get there.  He’s a kid from a far-flung village up toward the border with the mainland, where both of his parents are from. Everyone in his village opposes the protests, he said, and there are “triads” in the area, members of organized-crime groups that are seen as sometimes doing Beijing’s bidding.  Was he sorry that he’d put himself in danger?  “No regrets,” came the first text message response, at 7:29 p.m., even as police continued to mass outside Polytechnic and fears grew of a violent storming of the campus.  “They are wrong”  “We’re doing the right thing”  “It’s so unforgettable and good”  Hours later, he went down the rope.  Now, meeting to talk after a visit to a clinic for his hands, Tommy said he wasn’t sure what would come next for his city. Or himself. Although the university was still closed, he’d been keeping up with his studies, emailing professors and working on a paper about Hong Kong’s solid-waste treatment policy. Unable to go to the gym because of the hand injury – his athletic frame sheathed in an Adidas jogging suit – Tommy had been feeling restless.  It was obvious the troubles would continue, he said. “Carrie Lam will not accept the demands, the protesters will keep going, people will keep getting arrested,” he said. “The government wants to arrest all the people.”  But the future would still arrive and he had his own dreams: of a wife and a family, and being a man who provided for them. Tommy said he’d been thinking of applying for a government job after graduation. They’re steady and have good benefits.  He would also remain a part of the protest movement.  How could he manage both?  Tommy paused a moment before answering. Then, he said:  “I have to become two people.”  On the afternoon of December 1, life was sunshine and breeze at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre. Inside, a youth orchestra was scheduled to play its annual concert, billed  as “collaging Chinese music treasures from various soundscapes of China.” Out front, facing the water, a band played cover songs – belting out the lyrics to Bon Jovi’s “You Give Love a Bad Name.” Couples strolled on the boardwalk. The palms swayed. A shop sold ice cream.  And there was Pak, sitting on a bench. He’d been arrested trying to flee Polytechnic in the early morning hours of November 19. After a day spent in a police station, he made bail and moved back in with his parents.  Out in the open, in blue sweatpants and a grey sweatshirt, he was a pudgy teenager with the awkward habit of pushing his eyeglasses up the bridge of his nose as he spoke. He had a couple pimples above his left eye. Also, he was now facing a rioting charge, and had to report back to the police station in a few weeks.  Since his disappearance, the siege at Polytechnic had ended. The protesters simmered down. There was an election for local district councillors, and pro-democracy candidates won nearly 90% of 452 seats.  But two weeks after his arrest, Pak had shown up ready to protest again. A march was slated to start in a couple hours. He’d taken a bus down from one of Hong Kong’s poorest districts, with a black backpack that held his dark clothes and mask.  The lesson of the elections, he said, was that most Hong Kong citizens not only back the protests but “accept the violence level.” Otherwise, he said, they would have rebuked the reform ticket and cast their lot with pro-government candidates.  “I think,” he said, “the violence of the protesters needs to upgrade to setting off bombs.”  He’d been reading about the Russian Revolution and Vladimir Lenin. If he saw irony in studying the architect of the Soviet communist dictatorship while contemplating his own fight against the world’s preeminent Communist Party, he didn’t say so.  “The protesters, I think, will need some weapons, like rifles,” he said.  If it wasn’t possible to buy them, he said, it seemed easy enough to ransack police cars or even stations to steal them. He described how that could be done.  The protests that day veered back to confrontation. A black flag with the words “HONG KONG INDEPENDENCE” flapped above the crowd. The scene to the north, in Kowloon, “descended into chaos as rioters hijacked public order events and resorted to destructive acts like building barricades on roads, setting fires and vandalizing public facilities,” according to a police account. Any hopes that the elections might bring peace seemed fragile. December was off to a turbulent start.  In the weeks after walking out of Polytechnic University, slipping past the police, Fiona kept coming back to the heat of the protests. An assembly to support those who protested at Polytechnic. A rally to stop the use of tear gas, which featured little children carrying yellow balloons and a march past the city’s Legislative Council building.  And on a Saturday afternoon, the last day of November, a gathering of students and the elderly at the city’s Chater Garden. The park sits among thick trappings of wealth and power – the private Hong Kong Club, rows of bank buildings and, just down the street, luxury laced across the store windows of Chanel and Cartier. Fiona was with a friend toward the back, on the top of a wall, out of sight of the TV cameras. Her face was hidden behind a mask, as usual. Even between protesters, they usually pass nicknames and nods, with nothing that identifies them in daily life.  Her friend, a boy who goes to the same high school, held forth on revolution and the perils of greater mainland China influence in Hong Kong. Fiona listened, quietly. She nodded her head. She looked out at the crowd. It felt good to see that she was not alone, Fiona said. Though, she said, it was hard to tell where the movement was headed.  It could grind into the sort of underground movement that Tommy hinted at. It could erupt in the boom of Pak’s bloody fantasy.  For Fiona, she knew there was always the danger that police might track down her earlier presence at Polytechnic, ending her precarious dance between homework and street unrest.  But sitting there, as the chants echoed and the sun began to slide down the sky over Hong Kong, Fiona said there was no choice but to keep fighting.  A week later, on Dec. 8, Fiona was at Victoria Park, almost six months to the day since her first protest started there. Hundreds of thousands of people had come for the march. It took Fiona an hour just to get out of the park as the throngs slowly squeezed onto the road outside.  When they saw messages on their cellphones that police had massed down one side street, Fiona and three friends threw on their respirator masks and goggles. As they jogged in that direction, a stranger in the crowd handed them an umbrella; another stranger gave them bottles of water. They joined a group of others, clutching umbrellas and advancing toward police lines, then coming to a halt.  No tear gas or rubber bullets came. The police looked to have taken a step back.  Fiona and her friends dawdled, unsure of what to do. They joined the march, a great mass of people churning through Hong Kong, at one point holding cell phones aloft, an ocean of bobbing lights. They screamed obscenities at police when they saw them, with Fiona showing a middle finger and calling for their families to die. They watched a man throw a hammer at the Bank of China building and heard the crash of breaking glass.  Someone pulled out a can of black spray paint. In the middle of the road, Fiona and her friends took turns writing on the pavement. They left a message: “If we burn, you burn with us!” 	Reuters

The story buttressed a main claim of the protesters, that Beijing is intervening deeply in the affairs of the semi-autonomous city. A state-run newspaper denounced the story as “fake” and “shameful.” The article soon became unavailable in mainland China.  It wasn’t the Chinese government that blocked the story. The article was removed by Refinitiv, the financial information provider that distributes Reuters news to investors around the world on Eikon, a trading and analytics platform. The article was one of a growing number of stories that Refinitiv – which until last year was owned by Reuters’ parent company, Thomson Reuters Corp – has censored in mainland China under pressure from the central government.  Since August, Refinitiv has blocked more than 200 stories about the Hong Kong protests plus numerous other Reuters articles that could cast Beijing in an unfavorable light. Internal Refinitiv documents show that over the summer, the company installed an automated filtering system to facilitate the censoring. The system included the creation of a new code to   attach to some China stories, called “Restricted News.”  As a result, Refinitiv’s customers in China have been denied access to coverage of one of the biggest news events of the year, including two Reuters reports on downgrades of Hong Kong by credit-rating agencies. Nearly 100 other news providers available on Eikon in China have also been affected by the filtering.  Censorship in China has been intensifying in recent years under President Xi Jinping, and Western businesses have come under rising pressure to block news, speech and products that Beijing sees as politically dangerous. Refinitiv generates tens of millions of dollars of annual revenue in China. As Reuters reported in June, citing three people familiar with the matter, Refinitiv began the censorship effort earlier this year after a regulator threatened to suspend its Chinese operation.  Refinitiv has joined a lengthening list of companies complying with Chinese demands. They include hotel giant Marriott International Inc, which last year temporarily shut down its Chinese websites and apologized for, among other things, listing Taiwan as a separate country in a customer questionnaire. Several U.S. airlines also stopped describing Taiwan as non-Chinese territory on their websites. Beijing considers the self-governed island part of China. The companies have defended their actions.  The censorship has angered the top news and business executives of Reuters and the directors of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Co Ltd, an independent body tasked with preserving the news agency’s independence.  Speaking to Reuters journalists on a visit to the Singapore newsroom in October, Kim Williams, the Australian media executive who chairs the body, lashed out at Refinitiv, calling its actions “reprehensible” and a capitulation to “naked political aggression” from Beijing. Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler told Reuters journalists in London in November that the censorship was “damaging” the brand. “I don’t approve of it,” he said.  Refinitiv chief executive David Craig and Thomson Reuters CEO Jim Smith have held multiple talks, as recently as this week, in an effort to resolve the issue, said people familiar with the matter. Smith “was very concerned” upon learning about Craig’s decision to impose the filtering, said a senior Thomson Reuters official. It is not clear how close the two are to reaching a solution both sides find agreeable, one of the people said.  “We recognize that the processes that were put in place earlier this year need to be improved and are actively working on enhancements,” Refinitiv spokesman Patrick Meyer said of the filtering system in a statement. “As a global business, Refinitiv must comply with the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate. This is a challenge that not just Refinitiv faces, but also other companies and distributors of financial market information.”  Refinitiv was formed last year when a consortium led by private equity giant Blackstone purchased a 55% stake in Thomson Reuters’ Financial & Risk business, which included the Eikon terminal business, for about $20 billion and rebranded it.  Refinitiv and Thomson Reuters remain close: Reuters sells news to Eikon, and Thomson Reuters retains a 45% stake in Refinitiv. Refinitiv is by far Reuters’ largest client, providing nearly half its revenue. As part of the spin-off deal, Refinitiv agreed to make inflation-adjusted annual payments of $325 million to Reuters over 30 years for news – a reliable income stream that is rare in the media business.  The Founders Share directors are particularly incensed. They have complained to Thomson Reuters CEO Smith that by suppressing stories, Refinitiv is violating the terms of the deal. They also say they fear that Refinitiv, having given in to China’s demands, might start blocking stories in other countries.  Prior to the Blackstone deal, when Thomson Reuters controlled the Eikon business, Reuters stories were not blocked in China on Eikon. The Chinese government itself has been blocking access in China to the Reuters website for general readers, Reuters.com, for years, as well as the sites of many other foreign news organizations.  “Let the Chinese decide if they ban something,” said Pascal Lamy, a Founders Share director and former head of the World Trade Organization. “But this is not Refinitiv’s or Reuters’ decision.” Lamy said the directors believe the terms of the deal require Refinitiv to adhere to Reuters ethical rules on editorial integrity and independence, known as the Trust Principles, which “prevent you from accepting self-censorship.”  In response, Refinitiv said it is “complying with our obligations with respect to the Trust Principles.” It argues that in filtering out political stories for its own customers in China, it is following local laws and regulations as required by its operating license.  Smith, who sits on the boards of both Thomson Reuters and Refinitiv, did not respond to requests for comment.   The London Stock Exchange has agreed to buy Refinitiv for $27 billion in a deal that’s expected to close in the second half of next year. It declined to comment.  Reuters reported in June that Refinitiv had blocked several Reuters stories under government pressure. The articles were about the 30th anniversary of the bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. According to the people with knowledge of the matter, Refinitiv acted after the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC, which controls online speech, threatened to suspend the company’s service in China if it didn’t comply.  The CAC did not respond to questions about this article. China’s Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment.  On June 3, Reuters editor Adler and Michael Friedenberg, president of Reuters, emailed the staff saying they’d expressed concern to Refinitiv.  Refinitiv promised it would alert the newsroom when it came under pressure from Chinese regulators about Reuters coverage. The news agency, as it does when it receives any complaint from individuals and institutions it covers, then would determine if there was any reason to correct a published story.   In late July, Refinitiv asked Reuters to review an article that detailed how a Chinese government representative in Hong Kong had urged local residents to drive off protesters, just a week before a violent clash broke out between pro- and anti-government crowds in the area. That story, too, was touchy because it showed Beijing intervening in the internal affairs of Hong Kong.  Despite assurances from Reuters that the story was accurate, Refinitiv removed the headline of the story from Eikon in China, making the item difficult for users to find and view. On Aug. 2, Reuters published a story about the blocking of this article as well.  Refinitiv began ramping up its efforts to purge offending China coverage. Internal Refinitiv documents and emails describe how the company over the summer created an automated filtering system - referred to as the “Strategic China filter” - to block certain stories to Eikon users in mainland China.  In July, Refinitiv’s news platform architecture director requested that a new code be created, called “Restricted News,” that could be added to articles. He asked that it “should be hidden for all users (internal and external),” according to notes of a conference call on July 17 where the code was discussed. One reason was that Refinitiv didn’t want to give its mainland China customers the ability to disable the filtering.  In an email to colleagues, the platform director explained the code: “The flag is to highlight news that requires additional processing, due to Chinese govt restrictions, prior to consumption in China.”  The filtering system is designed to block stories for readers in mainland China but allow them to be accessed in other markets. It looks for restricted keywords in headlines, such as “Hong Kong” and “protest,” according to a person familiar with the matter.  Refinitiv employees also discussed by email whether the “Restricted News” code should be China-specific or “generic,” so it could be used to block stories in other countries in the future. The email exchange indicates they opted for a generic code. Reuters found no evidence that Refinitiv has deployed the filtering system in other nations. Refinitiv didn’t comment on whether it plans to use the restriction code elsewhere.  Eikon users outside mainland China can retrieve stories about the Hong Kong protests by clicking on headlines, or by searching for keywords or codes. For users inside China, however, articles that are blocked bring up this message: “You do not have access to this story.”  Refinitiv’s blocking of protest stories intensified after Aug. 30, when Reuters reported that Beijing had rejected a bid by Hong Kong leader Lam to compromise with the protesters. Before that date, all but five of 246 Reuters articles that had run in 2019 containing the words “Hong Kong” and “protest” in the headline were accessible on the mainland. By contrast, between Aug. 30 and Nov. 20, Refinitiv blocked nearly four out of five such articles that Reuters filed – 196 out of 251.  The censorship was especially severe between Sept. 4 and Oct. 7, when all 104 Reuters articles containing those words in the headline were blocked. At the time, demonstrators were rampaging across the city and police were responding with water cannons and rubber bullets.  Refinitiv also censored potentially market-moving stories that would have been of interest to Refinitiv’s core clientele of financial professionals. These included a Sept. 6 report that Fitch Ratings had downgraded Hong Kong’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating. Also blocked were stories on the effect of the protests on stock prices and initial public offerings.  Refinitiv eventually began having employees get involved in the filtering process to prevent the blocking of financial stories, according to a person familiar with the matter. Yet the filtering remains inconsistent.  It lets through some stories that China might consider politically taboo, including some articles about the Chinese government’s mass incarceration of Uighurs, a Muslim ethnic minority in western China. Many other articles on the Uighurs have been blocked.  Besides Reuters articles, the filtering has also blocked one or more stories from 97 other news providers that are available inside China on the Eikon system – including Xinhua, China’s official state-run news agency.   On Dec. 3, Refinitiv blocked a Xinhua story about a small demonstration in Hong Kong by pro-Beijing residents. They were quoted heatedly denouncing Washington over a new U.S. law that supports Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protesters.  And news relevant to investors is still being censored. Eikon users in mainland China couldn’t read this story shortly after it was published. It was blocked.  Reported by Steve Stecklow in London and New York.

77	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N28M4C2	December 12, 2019 /  9:12 PM / in 4 months	RPT-SPECIAL REPORT-Refinitiv created filter to block Reuters stories amid Hong Kong protests	(Repeats to add NEWS1 code)  * Refinitiv has blocked over 200 Reuters stories in mainland China on Hong Kong protests  * Under Chinese pressure, Refinitiv restricts stories in China from Reuters, 97 other providers on Eikon  * Refinitiv says it “must comply with the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate”  * CEOs of Refinitiv, Thomson Reuters are in talks in effort to resolve China dispute  By Steve Stecklow  LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - As anti-government demonstrations engulfed Hong Kong in August, Reuters broke a sensitive story: Beijing had rejected a secret proposal by city leader Carrie Lam to meet several of the protesters’ demands in a bid to defuse the unrest.  The story buttressed a main claim of the protesters, that Beijing is intervening deeply in the affairs of the semi-autonomous city. A state-run newspaper denounced the story as “fake” and “shameful.” The article soon became unavailable in mainland China.  It wasn’t the Chinese government that blocked the story. The article was removed by Refinitiv, the financial information provider that distributes Reuters news to investors around the world on Eikon, a trading and analytics platform. The article was one of a growing number of stories that Refinitiv – which until last year was owned by Reuters’ parent company, Thomson Reuters Corp – has censored in mainland China under pressure from the central government.  Since August, Refinitiv has blocked more than 200 stories about the Hong Kong protests plus numerous other Reuters articles that could cast Beijing in an unfavorable light. Internal Refinitiv documents show that over the summer, the company installed an automated filtering system to facilitate the censoring. The system included the creation of a new code to attach to some China stories, called “Restricted News.”  As a result, Refinitiv’s customers in China have been denied access to coverage of one of the biggest news events of the year, including two Reuters reports on downgrades of Hong Kong by credit-rating agencies. Nearly 100 other news providers available on Eikon in China have also been affected by the filtering.  Censorship in China has been intensifying in recent years under President Xi Jinping, and Western businesses have come under rising pressure to block news, speech and products that Beijing sees as politically dangerous. Refinitiv generates tens of millions of dollars of annual revenue in China. As Reuters reported in June, citing three people familiar with the matter, Refinitiv began the censorship effort earlier this year after a regulator threatened to suspend its Chinese operation.  Refinitiv has joined a lengthening list of companies complying with Chinese demands. They include hotel giant Marriott International Inc, which last year temporarily shut down its Chinese websites and apologized for, among other things, listing Taiwan as a separate country in a customer questionnaire. Several U.S. airlines also stopped describing Taiwan as non-Chinese territory on their websites. Beijing considers the self-governed island part of China. The companies have defended their actions.  The censorship has angered the top news and business executives of Reuters and the directors of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Co Ltd, an independent body tasked with preserving the news agency’s independence.  Speaking to Reuters journalists on a visit to the Singapore newsroom in October, Kim Williams, the Australian media executive who chairs the body, lashed out at Refinitiv, calling its actions “reprehensible” and a capitulation to “naked political aggression” from Beijing. Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler told Reuters journalists in London in November that the censorship was “damaging” the brand. “I don’t approve of it,” he said.  Refinitiv chief executive David Craig and Thomson Reuters CEO Jim Smith have held multiple talks, as recently as this week, in an effort to resolve the issue, said people familiar with the matter. Smith “was very concerned” upon learning about Craig’s decision to impose the filtering, said a senior Thomson Reuters official. It is not clear how close the two are to reaching a solution both sides find agreeable, one of the people said.  “We recognise that the processes that were put in place earlier this year need to be improved and are actively working on enhancements,” Refinitiv spokesman Patrick Meyer said of the filtering system in a statement. “As a global business, Refinitiv must comply with the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate. This is a challenge that not just Refinitiv faces, but also other companies and distributors of financial market information.”  Refinitiv was formed last year when a consortium led by private equity giant Blackstone purchased a 55% stake in Thomson Reuters’ Financial & Risk business, which included the Eikon terminal business, for about $20 billion and rebranded it.  Refinitiv and Thomson Reuters remain close: Reuters sells news to Eikon, and Thomson Reuters retains a 45% stake in Refinitiv. Refinitiv is by far Reuters’ largest client, providing nearly half its revenue. As part of the spin-off deal, Refinitiv agreed to make inflation-adjusted annual payments of $325 million to Reuters over 30 years for news – a reliable income stream that is rare in the media business.  The Founders Share directors are particularly incensed. They have complained to Thomson Reuters CEO Smith that by suppressing stories, Refinitiv is violating the terms of the deal. They also say they fear that Refinitiv, having given in to China’s demands, might start blocking stories in other countries.  Prior to the Blackstone deal, when Thomson Reuters controlled the Eikon business, Reuters stories were not blocked in China on Eikon. The Chinese government itself has been blocking access in China to the Reuters website for general readers, Reuters.com, for years, as well as the sites of many other foreign news organizations.  “Let the Chinese decide if they ban something,” said Pascal Lamy, a Founders Share director and former head of the World Trade Organization. “But this is not Refinitiv’s or Reuters’ decision.” Lamy said the directors believe the terms of the deal require Refinitiv to adhere to Reuters ethical rules on editorial integrity and independence, known as the Trust Principles, which “prevent you from accepting self-censorship.”  In response, Refinitiv said it is “complying with our obligations with respect to the Trust Principles.” It argues that in filtering out political stories for its own customers in China, it is following local laws and regulations as required by its operating license.  Smith, who sits on the boards of both Thomson Reuters and Refinitiv, did not respond to requests for comment.  The London Stock Exchange has agreed to buy Refinitiv for $27 billion in a deal that’s expected to close in the second half of next year. It declined to comment.  Reuters reported in June that Refinitiv had blocked several Reuters stories under government pressure. The articles were about the 30th anniversary of the bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. According to the people with knowledge of the matter, Refinitiv acted after the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC, which controls online speech, threatened to suspend the company’s service in China if it didn’t comply.  The CAC did not respond to questions about this article. China’s Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment.  On June 3, Reuters editor Adler and Michael Friedenberg, president of Reuters, emailed the staff saying they’d expressed concern to Refinitiv.  Refinitiv promised it would alert the newsroom when it came under pressure from Chinese regulators about Reuters coverage. The news agency, as it does when it receives any complaint from individuals and institutions it covers, then would determine if there was any reason to correct a published story.  In late July, Refinitiv asked Reuters to review an article that detailed how a Chinese government representative in Hong Kong had urged local residents to drive off protesters, just a week before a violent clash broke out between pro- and anti-government crowds in the area. That story, too, was touchy because it showed Beijing intervening in the internal affairs of Hong Kong.  Despite assurances from Reuters that the story was accurate, Refinitiv removed the headline of the story from Eikon in China, making the item difficult for users to find and view. On Aug. 2, Reuters published a story about the blocking of this article as well.  Refinitiv began ramping up its efforts to purge offending China coverage. Internal Refinitiv documents and emails describe how the company over the summer created an automated filtering system - referred to as the “Strategic China filter” - to block certain stories to Eikon users in mainland China.  In July, Refinitiv’s news platform architecture director requested that a new code be created, called “Restricted News,” that could be added to articles. He asked that it “should be hidden for all users (internal and external),” according to notes of a conference call on July 17 where the code was discussed. One reason was that Refinitiv didn’t want to give its mainland China customers the ability to disable the filtering.  In an email to colleagues, the platform director explained the code: “The flag is to highlight news that requires additional processing, due to Chinese govt restrictions, prior to consumption in China.”  The filtering system is designed to block stories for readers in mainland China but allow them to be accessed in other markets. It looks for restricted keywords in headlines, such as “Hong Kong” and “protest,” according to a person familiar with the matter.  Refinitiv employees also discussed by email whether the “Restricted News” code should be China-specific or “generic,” so it could be used to block stories in other countries in the future. The email exchange indicates they opted for a generic code. Reuters found no evidence that Refinitiv has deployed the filtering system in other nations. Refinitiv didn’t comment on whether it plans to use the restriction code elsewhere.  Eikon users outside mainland China can retrieve stories about the Hong Kong protests by clicking on headlines, or by searching for keywords or codes. For users inside China, however, articles that are blocked bring up this message: “You do not have access to this story.”  Refinitiv’s blocking of protest stories intensified after Aug. 30, when Reuters reported that Beijing had rejected a bid by Hong Kong leader Lam to compromise with the protesters. Before that date, all but five of 246 Reuters articles that had run in 2019 containing the words “Hong Kong” and “protest” in the headline were accessible on the mainland. By contrast, between Aug. 30 and Nov. 20, Refinitiv blocked nearly four out of five such articles that Reuters filed – 196 out of 251.  The censorship was especially severe between Sept. 4 and Oct. 7, when all 104 Reuters articles containing those words in the headline were blocked. At the time, demonstrators were rampaging across the city and police were responding with water cannons and rubber bullets.  Refinitiv also censored potentially market-moving stories that would have been of interest to Refinitiv’s core clientele of financial professionals. These included a Sept. 6 report that Fitch Ratings had downgraded Hong Kong’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating. Also blocked were stories on the effect of the protests on stock prices and initial public offerings.  Refinitiv eventually began having employees get involved in the filtering process to prevent the blocking of financial stories, according to a person familiar with the matter. Yet the filtering remains inconsistent.  It lets through some stories that China might consider politically taboo, including some articles about the Chinese government’s mass incarceration of Uighurs, a Muslim ethnic minority in western China. Many other articles on the Uighurs have been blocked.  Besides Reuters articles, the filtering has also blocked one or more stories from 97 other news providers that are available inside China on the Eikon system – including Xinhua, China’s official state-run news agency.  On Dec. 3, Refinitiv blocked a Xinhua story about a small demonstration in Hong Kong by pro-Beijing residents. They were quoted heatedly denouncing Washington over a new U.S. law that supports Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protesters.  Last weekend, Hong Kong witnessed another huge protest, with turnout estimated at 183,000 by police and four times that by organizers. Citizens of all stripes marched, from students to professionals to the elderly.  Eikon users in mainland China couldn’t read the Reuters story on the mass protest. It was blocked.

On June 12, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters occupying roads near the legislative council just as it was to give a second reading to the bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.   After the clash, the council reading was indefinitely postponed and the bill later formally withdrawn. But outrage caused by the police response contributed to the unrest evolving into a broader movement calling for greater democracy.   Demonstrators’ demands now include universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into the police handling of the protests. Police have described their actions as reactive and restrained.  On Thursday, several thousand Hong Kongers of all ages gathered in a central park in the heart of the Chinese-ruled city’s financial district for to mark the event, starting with a moment of silence.  “June 12 was a turning point in this movement,” said Mark Chou, a 24-year-old engineer in the crowd. “We had a 1 million people peaceful march on June 9, but the government was still pushing the bill forward at that time. This experience taught us peaceful protest would not work in this city.”  Organizers were collecting Christmas cards to be sent to people arrested during demonstrations in the past six months. Another core demand of the protesters is an amnesty for the more than 6,000 people arrested since June.  “We should never forget those who have sacrificed themselves fighting for Hong Kong people’s freedom. If frontliners did not surround (the council) and stop the second reading, the bill would have passed,” said Mandy Chan, 23, a teaching assistant.  Her card read: “When you feel desperate, please keep your faith because we are all waiting for you and Hong Kong will be brighter when you are free to go.”  Elsewhere, hundreds queued at Tai Wai Po Fook Memorial Hall to lay flowers and mourn last month’s death of Chow Tsz-lok, a 22-year-old student who fell from the third floor of a parking lot as protesters were being scattered by police.   In a sign the movement retains broad support, pro-democracy candidates won almost 90 percent of the seats in district council elections last month, while a peaceful march on Sunday drew 800,000 demonstrators, according to organizers, though police estimated the crowd at fewer than 200,000.  On Thursday morning, Hong Kong police said they arrested three people overnight - a 15-year-old girl, a 16-year-old boy and a 29-year-old man - in connection with vandalizing public buses. A fourth person escaped, police said.    According to police reports the four boarded buses, pressed the emergency buttons, then began smashing windows with hammers.  Police also said they received reports that five people threw petrol bombs at a Japanese restaurant on the street level of a shopping mall. There were no reported injuries.     Police said several other people started a fire at a street junction in Mong Kok, an area that has regularly been the site of clashes between protesters and police.   Police did not say the vandalism was connected to the protests.   Earlier this week, police said officers had defused two homemade bombs found at a centrally-located school.  Separately, the Hong Kong Football Club Rugby Section announced the cancellation of its annual rugby 10s tournament, scheduled for next April, due to the unrest. The 10s tournament is traditionally played ahead of the better-known Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, with both events drawing prominent names in the rugby world. 	Reuters

Her card read: “When you feel desperate, please keep your faith because we are all waiting for you and Hong Kong will be brighter when you are free to go.”  Elsewhere, hundreds queued at Tai Wai Po Fook Memorial Hall to lay flowers and mourn last month’s death of Chow Tsz-lok, a 22-year-old student who fell from the third floor of a parking lot as protesters were being scattered by police.   In a sign the movement retains broad support, pro-democracy candidates won almost 90 percent of the seats in district council elections last month, while a peaceful march on Sunday drew 800,000 demonstrators, according to organizers, though police estimated the crowd at fewer than 200,000.  On Thursday morning, Hong Kong police said they arrested three people overnight - a 15-year-old girl, a 16-year-old boy and a 29-year-old man - in connection with vandalizing public buses. A fourth person escaped, police said.    According to police reports the four boarded buses, pressed the emergency buttons, then began smashing windows with hammers.  Police also said they received reports that five people threw petrol bombs at a Japanese restaurant on the street level of a shopping mall. There were no reported injuries.     Police said several other people started a fire at a street junction in Mong Kok, an area that has regularly been the site of clashes between protesters and police.   Police did not say the vandalism was connected to the protests.   Earlier this week, police said officers had defused two homemade bombs found at a centrally-located school.  Separately, the Hong Kong Football Club Rugby Section announced the cancellation of its annual rugby 10s tournament, scheduled for next April, due to the unrest. The 10s tournament is traditionally played ahead of the better-known Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, with both events drawing prominent names in the rugby world. 	Reuters

Anti-government protests in the Chinese-controlled city have attracted broad concern in democratic Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory. Taiwan’s government has said it strongly supports people’s aspirations for freedom and democracy.  Taiwan currently has no law on refugees that could be applied to Hong Kong protesters who may seek asylum on the island. Its laws do promise though to help Hong Kong citizens whose safety and liberty are threatened for political reasons.  Writing on his Facebook page Han Kuo-yu, the presidential candidate for the Kuomintang party that favors closer ties with China, said he “fully supported” the passing of a refugee law amid the protests in Hong Kong and that there could be “no discounts on human rights”.  Han, trailing in the polls behind President Tsai Ing-wen and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ahead of the Jan. 11 vote, said his opponent was using the Hong Kong protests to whip up concerns at home for electoral gain.  Tsai has denied this. Han, who is mayor of the southern city of Kaohsiung and has cast doubt on his low polling numbers, said the pro-independence DPP was being “coy” about a refugee law.  “Human rights are the essence of democracy and democracy is an extension of human rights,” wrote Han. “This main dish, the refugee law, should be put on the table.”  China has denounced comments by Taiwan’s government and politicians about the Hong Kong protests.  If Han were to defy expectations and win, Beijing would likely not take kindly to him formally offering asylum to Hong Kong protesters.  Taiwan’s government says there has been a spike in the number of Hong Kongers moving to Taiwan, but it is unclear how many may try to claim asylum there.  Speaking to reporters earlier in the day, Chiu Chui-cheng, the deputy head of Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, responded to a question on a refugee law by saying the authorities would provide help as needed to people from Hong Kong in Taiwan.  “We know that these students are anxious about many people who may be staying in Taiwan and looking for help and hope that they can get proper or positive assistance,” Chiu said, following a meeting with a Hong Kong student delegation.  Taiwan will, in accordance with existing laws and on humanitarian principles, provide “necessary help for individual cases”, Chiu said, without specifying which students he had met. 	Reuters

Working as an associate editor for Suara, a newspaper popular with Indonesian migrant workers in Hong Kong, Indah, 39, had been live-streaming in the Bahasa Indonesia language on the frontlines of demonstrations.  At the time of the shooting Indah was reporting on the street protests alongside other journalists from the vantage point of a footbridge. She believes she was hit by a rubber bullet. Whatever the projectile was, it has caused the permanent loss of sight in her right eye.  “I felt like I could not bear it anymore. I thought it’s going to be my end,” she told Reuters.   Indah recalled hearing fellow journalists behind her shout: “We are journalists, stop shooting at us!”   The Chinese-ruled city has been roiled by more than six months of sometimes violent protests as activists call for greater democracy and an independent inquiry into police actions, among other demands.  Police, who have at times fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse demonstrators, say they have shown restraint in the face of escalating violence.    Indah and her legal representative told Reuters they have filed a legal request asking the police to name the officer involved in the incident so they can pursue a civil case, but that they have had no meaningful response so far.  Hong Kong police did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.   While Indah still feels pain, she is adjusting to life with one eye, although she is still haunted by the experience.  “When I was in the hospital, I keep waking up because some images (keep) flashing back ... the projectile keeps coming back and coming back to my right eye,” she said, while holding back tears.

The protests in the Chinese-controlled city have been widely covered in democratic Taiwan, which China claims as its sacred territory, and are frequently mentioned by Tsai and her ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on the campaign trail as a warning on the potential dangers Taiwan faces from China.  Writing on his Facebook page over the weekend, Keith Fong, president of the Hong Kong Baptist University Students’ Union, said the DPP only verbally supported the protests and had not enacted specific laws to support the protesters.  People would inevitably suspect that the DPP “only wants to exchange Hongkonger’s sacrifices for Taiwanese people’s votes”, he added.   Tsai’s main opponent in the Jan. 11 presidential election, Han Kuo-yu from the Kuomintang party which favors close ties with China, wrote on his Facebook page on Tuesday that Tsai was using Hong Kong as a “tool” for votes.  Speaking to reporters later on Tuesday, Tsai said that Taiwan had always had a supportive attitude toward the people of Hong Kong taking to the streets to fight for democracy.      What is happening in Hong Kong has also put the people of Taiwan on alert and made them think that the freedom and democratic values Taiwan has must be protected with even greater strength, she added.   “Therefore, when they watch and listen to all the politicians, they pay special attention to the views and determination of these politicians or candidates on these issues,” Tsai said.   “So I do not think we are using Hong Kong people to conduct the election; rather it is a process of self-vigilance by the people of Taiwan after what has happened in Hong Kong.”  Taiwan currently has no law on refugees which could be applied to Hong Kong protesters who may seek asylum on the island though its laws promise to help Hong Kong citizens whose safety and liberty are threatened for political reasons.

Protesters called for strikes across the city on Monday, but most railway and transport links ran smoothly during the morning rush hour and there were no reports of widespread disruptions.    Vast crowds of black-clad demonstrators had thronged the streets of the Asian financial hub on Sunday, in the largest anti-government rally since local elections last month and a resounding show of continued support for the pro-democracy movement.  While the march appeared to be largely peaceful - in marked contrast to some other mass demonstrations over the last six months, where protesters fought pitched battles with police - authorities said there was some damage after it ended.  “Although the event was generally peaceful, acts of breaching public peace happened afterwards,” police said in a statement on Monday.   “Some rioters spray-painted the exterior walls of the High Court, threw petrol bombs and set fire outside the High Court and the Court of Final Appeal, damaging government properties and seriously challenging the spirit of the rule of law,” police said, adding that shops and banks were vandalized in the Causeway Bay and Wan Chai areas of Hong Kong island.  Reuters reporters at the march on Sunday saw graffiti and protesters setting up barricades, but were not in the vicinity of the other incidents.  The Hong Kong Bar Association condemned what it called “acts of arson and vandalism” and said those responsible must be brought to justice.  Protesters estimated the turnout at 800,000, while police said it was 183,000.  Police said they arrested 42 people over the weekend for rioting, possessing weapons and other charges. Some 6,022 people have now been arrested in relation to the unrest since early June, police said.  In an editorial, the official China Daily newspaper called on the Hong Kong government to uphold the rule of law.   “Many residents in Hong Kong are fed up with the violence and disruption that have plagued the city for months,” said the newspaper, often used by Beijing to put out its message.  Hong Kong’s new police commissioner had said he would take a “hard and soft approach” to the demonstrations, where acts of violence would be treated harshly but other issues more flexibly.  The chairman and president of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Hong Kong were denied entry over the weekend to the neighboring Chinese territory of Macau, without explanation.  Macau’s security chief, Wong Sio Chak, on Monday said security concerns were the only reason for barring entry into the city, broadcaster RTHK reported.  AmCham Chairman Robert Grieves and President Tara Joseph had been traveling to Macau for an annual ball. The pair were told to sign a statement saying they “voluntarily agreed not to pursue entry to Macau”.  Wong declined to comment specifically on their cases and said it was speculation that their refusal was linked to Beijing’s response to U.S. legislation backing pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, RTHK said.  U.S. President Donald Trump last month signed into law the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, linking the former British colony’s special treatment under U.S. law to its autonomy from Beijing.  The unrest in the city of about 7.4 million people started in June as demonstrations against a now-withdrawn bill allowing extradition to mainland China. It has since morphed into calls for greater democratic freedoms and sometimes violent protests.  Protesters have set out five demands, including universal suffrage and an investigation into alleged police brutality.     China has repeatedly blamed foreign powers, including the United States, for stirring up the unrest. 	Reuters

U.S. congressional sources and China experts say Beijing appears especially sensitive to provisions in the Uighur Act passed by the House of Representatives this week banning exports to China of items that can be used for surveillance of individuals, including facial and voice-recognition technology.  China will also be upset that the bill - which still requires Senate passage and Trump’s signature to become law - calls for sanctions against a member of the powerful politburo for the first time. But its commercial stipulations have even more practical power to hurt the interests of Chinese leaders, sources say.      Senior members of both Congress and the Trump administration have sounded the alarm on China’s detention of at least a million Uighur Muslims, by U.N. estimates, in the northwestern region of Xinjiang as a grave abuse of human rights and religious freedom. China rejects the charges.  A Chinese government source, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters China could tolerate the Hong Kong bill, but the Uighur Act went too far and could jeopardize efforts to reach a phase-one deal to end a trade war buffeting the global economy that Trump has made a key priority.  A U.S. congressional source also said a Washington-based figure close to the Chinese government told him recently it disliked the Uighur bill more than the Hong Kong bill for “dollars and cents reasons,” because the former measure contained serious export controls on money-spinning security technology, while also threatening asset freezes and visa bans on individual officials.   Victor Shih, an associate professor of China and Pacific Relations at the University of California, San Diego, said mass surveillance was big business in China and a number of tech companies there could be hurt by the law if it passes.  China spent roughly 1.24 trillion yuan ($176 billion) on domestic security in 2017 - 6.1% of total government spending and more than was spent on the military. Budgets for internal security, of which surveillance technology is a part, have doubled in regions including Xinjiang and Beijing.  Shih said investors in such firms included family members of China’s political elite, who could suffer financially if the bill became law.   “This bill affects bottom lines, this is why there is a stronger reaction from Beijing,” he said.   Shih said the bill would affect the ability of Chinese companies to procure technology from the United States and this would adversely affect their product development. He said it could also affect their ability to list on U.S. markets.  China has warned that the Uighur bill would affect bilateral cooperation, raising concerns about the impact on trade talks, less than two weeks before a new round of U.S. tariffs already threatening another breakdown is scheduled to take effect.  In editorials on Thursday, Chinese official media called for harsh reprisals in response to bill. [L8N28F02P]  The English-language China Daily called the bill a “stab in the back, given Beijing’s efforts to stabilize the already turbulent China-U.S. relationship” and warned of reprisals.  “It seems an odds-on bet that more (sanctions) can be expected if the latest approval for State Department meddling goes into the statute books,” it said.     China’s envoy to the United States, Cui Tiankai, said on Wednesday the two countries were trying to resolve their differences over trade, but “destructive forces” were trying to drive a wedge between them.  The White House has yet to say whether Trump would sign or veto the bill, which contains a provision allowing the president to waive sanctions if he determines it to be in the national interest.  No dates has yet been scheduled for a vote on the bill in the Republican-controlled Senate, a decision which rests with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Senator Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said lawmakers would proceed with caution.  “Because of the relationship we have with China, because of the trade negotiations going on, and everything else, it’s important that we don’t do anything that would cause those negotiations not to bear fruit,” Risch told Reuters.

Exports by the world’s second-largest economy likely rose 1.0% from a year earlier last month, according to a median estimate from a Reuters poll of 20 economists, improving from a 0.9% drop in October and marking the first pickup since a 3.3% rise in July.   Imports are forecast to have dropped 1.8% from a year earlier in November, also a slower rate of decline from the 6.4% slump the month before, the poll showed.   Beijing and Washington remain locked in weeks of negotiations to ink an interim “phase one” trade deal aimed at de-escalating the 17-month-long dispute that has led to tit-for-tat tariffs. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that trade talks are “going well,” a day after spooking markets with a warning that the deal might have to wait until after the November 2020 U.S. presidential elections.   The trade row between the world’s two biggest economies has weakened corporate profits, investment and global growth.   Washington has given no indication that it plans to scrap new tariffs on $156 billion worth of Chinese imports scheduled for Dec 15, which could torpedo the negotiations. U.S. legislative action supporting Hong Kong protests and condemning the camps for ethnic Muslim minorities in the Western Chinese region of Xinjiang have also angered Beijing.  “Should the tariffs...take effect as planned, a phase 1 deal would be very much in doubt,” Commerzbank analyst Hao Zhou and economist Bernd Weidensteiner said in a note published Wednesday. “Then, the markets could repeat the massive meltdown as happened in last December as President Trump kept up pressure on trade issues.”   Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying warned on Wednesday the Xinjiang bill will affect bilateral cooperation and that China will take “decisive” countermeasures to defend its interest if what she called U.S. protectionism and bullying over trade continues.    Analysts say an escalation of the trade war would further undermine China’s economy at a time when growth fort 2019 is already expected to slip to its weakest in decades. Gross domestic product growth in the third quarter slumped to near 30-year lows.  Though an official survey on manufacturing showed an unexpected expansion in activity last month, falling industrial profits and factory prices suggest persisting downward pressure.   “We will face even greater risks and challenges next year,” Chinese Premier Li Keqiang was quoted as saying in a government statement during a meeting of the nation’s cabinet on measures to support employment.  Despite the growing strains on the economy, Beijing remains reluctant to implement major stimulus for fear of heightening financial risks given already high levels of debt. Authorities have instead opted for more targeted measures such as  incremental interest rate reductions and bringing forward 1 trillion yuan ($142.07 billion) of the 2020 local government special bonds quota to this year.       People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang reiterated in a signed article published on Sunday that China will not resort to quantitative easing and is committed to maintaining a prudent monetary policy.

Expectations of a quick deal had receded already, after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday it might take until late 2020 to reach agreement.  Approval by the U.S. House of Representatives of the Uighur Act of 2019, which still requires passage by the Republican-controlled Senate before being sent to Trump, has angered Beijing and further strained an already testy relationship.  Several sources familiar with Beijing’s stance told Reuters the bill could jeopardize the so-called phase-one trade deal already fraught with disagreements and complications.  With a new round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods scheduled to take effect in less than two weeks, the possibility of another breakdown is growing.  “Do you think if America takes actions to hurt China’s interests we won’t take any action?” Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said when asked whether the Uighur bill would affect the trade negotiations. “I think any wrong words and deeds must pay the due price.”          Negotiators have continued to work on the trade deal. But sources familiar with the talks say the two sides are still wrangling over the details, including whether existing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will be removed and how much in additional U.S. agricultural products China will buy.      Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that Washington and Beijing are “moving closer” to agreeing on how much tariffs would be rolled back in an initial trade deal despite the Hong Kong and Xinjiang issues, citing people familiar with the talks.  U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC on Tuesday that staff-level trade negotiations with China were continuing but no high-level trade talks had been scheduled. Planned U.S. tariffs on remaining Chinese imports will take effect on Dec. 15 barring significant progress in the talks, or a deal, he said.       Hua said China would set no timeline or deadline for a trade deal and would take “decisive” countermeasures to defend its interests if what she called U.S. protectionism and bullying over trade continued.   She did not elaborate on what the measures might be.   A Chinese official who declined to be identified warned that U.S. implementation of the new round of tariffs scheduled on Dec. 15 would be countered by China with retaliatory tariffs - an outcome the official said would seriously disrupt talks.  Another Chinese official said it may take a very long time for Washington and Beijing to reach a deal if they cannot find a way to strike while “the iron is hot.”  The Uighur bill, which was passed 407-1 in the Democratic-controlled House, requires the U.S. president to condemn abuses against Muslims and calls for the closure of mass detention camps in its western region of Xinjiang. It also calls on Trump to impose sanctions for the first time on a member of China’s powerful politburo, Xinjiang Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo.   Beijing called the bill a malicious attack on China, demanded the United States keep it from becoming law and said it would act to defend its interests as necessary.   Vice Foreign Minister Qin Gang made “stern representations” to William Klein, the U.S. embassy’s minister counselor for political affairs, and urged the United States to stop interfering in China’s domestic affairs, state TV reported.  The U.S. embassy in China said it would not speculate on China’s possible counter-measures.   “We continue to call on (China) to immediately release all those arbitrarily detained, and to end its draconian policies that for more than two years have terrorized its own citizens in Xinjiang,” it said in a statement.  The White House has yet to say whether Trump would sign or veto the bill, which contains a provision allowing the president to waive sanctions if he determines that to be in the national interest.  A U.S. State Department spokeswoman said it was closely monitoring developments related to the Uighur Act and shared congressional concerns about China’s “campaign of repression in Xinjiang.” However, she did not say whether the department supported the bill itself.  In October, the State Department announced visa restrictions on officials believed responsible for abuses in Xinjiang, but did not say if they included Chen.  Dilxat Raxit, spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress, said the House bill was an important action opposing “China’s continued push of extreme persecution”, and that the organization looks forward to Trump signing it into law.        Analysts say China’s response to the passage of the Uighur bill could be stronger than its reaction to the U.S. law backing Hong Kong protesters. Beijing said on Monday it banned U.S. military ships and aircraft from visiting the island and sanctioned several U.S.-based non-government organizations.  Global Times, an influential tabloid published by the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party, tweeted on Tuesday that Beijing would soon release a so-called unreliable entities list imposing sanctions against those who harm Chinese interests.  It said China was expediting the process for the list because the U.S. House bill would “harm Chinese firms’ interests”, and that “relevant” U.S. entities would be among the targets.  	Reuters

U.S. President Donald Trump last month signed into law congressional legislation which supported Hong Kong protesters, despite angry objections from Beijing, with which he is seeking a deal to end a damaging trade war.

Months of demonstrations against mainland China’s growing influence have pushed the city’s economy into its first recession in a decade, prompted some tycoons to move their wealth offshore, and canceled events such as industry conferences and music festivals.       Lawyers and other legal professionals told Reuters the unrest also risks undermining the city’s position as one of the world’s top centers for arbitration - a process of settling disputes outside the public court system - with cases moving to rival Singapore.       International firms in dispute look for neutral sites with trusted legal systems for arbitration, and the parties involved decide where to hold hearings and which jurisdiction’s rules should be used.       Countries compete to become international arbitration venues not just because it is a multi-billion dollar global industry, but because it bolsters their reputation for being a good place to do business. Singapore and Hong Kong are the two leading arbitration hubs in Asia, and in the top five globally, according to Queen Mary University of London.  Australian mining firm Kingsgate said last month it had moved hearings related to a dispute with the Thai government from Hong Kong to Singapore early next year over safety concerns.       Lawyers say at least two other cases have moved their hearings from Hong Kong to Singapore because of the unrest, adding that more could follow.  Maxwell Chambers, the main venue for arbitration meetings in Singapore, said a “few hearings” had moved there from Hong Kong in recent months because of the protests. It did not give details of the cases.      Sarah Grimmer, Secretary General of the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, declined to comment. But she said the center’s case numbers were at a record high, up 20% from this time last year.  “There are some cases - some hearings - that have shifted just for short-term practical reasons,” said Singapore-based barrister Toby Landau, adding that he knew of two or three cases that had moved from Hong Kong to Singapore.   He said the bigger question was whether parties would choose an arbitration jurisdiction outside Hong Kong “because of a view about long–term instability.”      If Hong Kong laws are chosen as the framework for arbitration - making it the “seat” for the case - its courts will have supervisory powers over the arbitration even if the proceedings are held elsewhere.      Although most of the unrest has been restricted to certain areas in Hong Kong, protests paralyzed broader parts of the city for nearly a week in November, including the central business district.

The government’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, prodded officials at a foreign ministry gathering last month to display stronger “fighting spirit” in the face of international challenges, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.  While Wang did not give explicit direction at the event, the instructions come after several senior Chinese diplomats set up Twitter accounts, some of which have been used to attack Beijing’s critics. This week, the foreign ministry also launched a Twitter account.  More than 1,000 current and former officials attended the event in Beijing, singing patriotic songs to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the foreign ministry.  “This is the first time we have been told to show more ‘fighting spirit’,” said one source who attended the celebration.  Wang’s comments reflect President Xi Jinping’s revamp of foreign and military policy, in which he has abandoned the approach laid out by reform architect Deng Xiaoping, who said China should hide its strength and bide its time while it developed.  Xi’s wide-ranging policies have included the multi-billion dollar Belt and Road Initative and the establishment of the China-controlled Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank.  On Monday, the foreign ministry made its debut on Twitter. One of @MFA_China’s inaugural tweets outlined China’s response to a new U.S. law on Hong Kong while another took a poke at the case of a man claiming to be a Chinese spy seeking asylum in Australia.  Within a day and a half it had nearly 10,000 followers.  The ministry did not reply immediately to faxed questions about its new Twitter account, the November event or the policy.  RE-SHAPING NARRATIVE  State-run Chinese news outlets have had a presence on overseas social media platforms for years.  And the government has been accused of being involved in other ways - Twitter and Facebook said in August they had suspended hundreds of accounts that they said were part of a coordinated state-backed effort by China to undermine protests in Hong Kong. Beijing has defended the right of Chinese people and media to make their voices heard on Hong Kong.  In the last few months, Chinese ambassadors and other senior diplomats have set up at least a dozen Twitter accounts. Twitter has said it considers “official government voices on Twitter an important element of the service”.  The new accounts reflect efforts by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to attempt to re-shape the global narrative, said Anne-Marie Brady, a Chinese politics specialist at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand.  “China’s international image is a big preoccupation for the CCP leadership,” she said.  Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times newspaper which is published by the party, said China’s pushback, while perhaps appearing defensive at times, was natural.  The West’s voices are more numerous and its “apparatus of public opinion” more developed than China’s, he told Reuters.  “I think this is a problem for China,” he said.  In the last six months, Chinese ambassadors to Austria, Iran, the Maldives, Mali, Namibia, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Suriname, the United States and the UK have joined Twitter.  Zhao Lijian, a deputy head of the ministry’s information department, has been one of the highest profile diplomats on the platform, building on a Twitter following he started when posted to Pakistan until taking his new post in October.  Zhao has regularly needled the United States, with recent tweets thanking America for “squandering trillions of dollars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria” and highlighting racism in Washington, DC.  Mike Chinoy, a non-resident senior fellow at the University of Southern California’s U.S.-China Institute, said he expected China to aggressively make use of social media, perhaps even drawing inspiration from the U.S. president.  “I assume there are diplomats in the foreign ministry and elsewhere in the Chinese bureaucracy who’ve been watching the extraordinary skill with which Donald Trump used Twitter to shape the political debate in the States and beyond, and so why can’t we do that too?” 	Reuters

The law “doesn’t make it better, but we’ll see what happens,” Trump said, talking to reporters. He gave no indication when the deal would be finalized, but two other U.S. officials said a deal could still happen this year depending on China’s actions.  Washington and Beijing have yet to ink a so-called “phase one” trade agreement announced in October, which had raised hopes of a de-escalation in their prolonged trade war. The global economy has shuddered with each salvo of tariff hikes by the world’s two largest economies.   “The Chinese are always negotiating. I’m very happy where we are,” Trump said as he prepared to depart the White House for a NATO summit in London. “The Chinese want to make a deal. We’ll see what happens.”  Chinese President Xi Jinping said last month he wants to work out a trade deal with Washington, but broader bilateral tensions have flared amid U.S. legislative action supporting Hong Kong’s protesters, and targeting camps for Uighur ethnic minorities in the western region of Xinjiang.   Trump last week signed a new law backing protesters in Hong Kong and threatened China with possible sanctions on human rights. Beijing in response barred U.S. military vessels and aircraft from visiting Hong Kong and sanctioned several U.S. non-government organizations. News site Axios also reported on Sunday the Hong Kong law stalled the trade deal.  Global Times, an influential tabloid published by the official People’s Daily newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party, tweeted Tuesday that Beijing will soon release its so-called unreliable entities list imposing sanctions against those who harm China’s interests.   The paper said China is expediting the process for the list because the U.S. House is expected to pass a bill on Xinjiang that will “harm Chinese firms’ interests”, and that “relevant” U.S. entities will be part of Beijing’s list.   The U.S. Senate in September passed the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019, a bill that calls on China to end what it calls “arbitrary detention, torture, and harassment” of Uighurs and other ethnic Muslim minorities. The bill is being considered by the U.S. House of Representatives.  Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin also tweeted separately on Tuesday that China could ban all U.S. diplomatic passport holders from visiting Xinjiang and may also impose visa restrictions against U.S. lawmakers and officials with “odious performance” on Xinjiang. He did not say how he obtained this information.  When asked to comment on the claim, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying repeated comments she made on Monday that China will implement further measures according to how the situation develops.  “The determination of China’s government to oppose foreign forces interfering in China’s internal affairs is firm and unshakable,” said Hua, speaking at a news briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.   The U.S. embassy in Beijing declined to comment on the reports of possible Chinese government action.

Many investors were reluctant to buy negative-yielding JGBs due to lingering uncertainty around the U.S.-China trade deal.  Although fears of a re-escalation in trade tensions after U.S. legislation supporting Hong Kong protesters last week dented risk assets, investors were in no haste to buy bonds either as they still think a compromise will be reached.  Against that backdrop, the 2.1-trillion yen auction of 10-year JGBs drew bids 3.28 times the offer, down from 3.62 times in the previous auction.  The auction’s tail, or the gap between the lowest and average prices, widened to 0.16 from 0.05 last month.  Benchmark 10-year JGB futures fell 0.22 point to 152.54, the lowest close since mid-April. Trading volume jumped to 41,631 lots, the highest in about a month.  The 10-year cash JGB yield rose 2.5 basis points to minus 0.025%, hitting its highest level since April.  The five-year yield rose 2.5 basis points to minus 0.135%, a 7 1/2-month high.  The two-year JGB yield rose 1.5 basis points to minus 0.155%.  Yields on longer-dated bonds also rose, but they stayed below their multi-month peaks hit last month. 	Reuters

The MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares gained 0.4% in November, its third successive monthly rise.  The U.S.-China trade deal that Washington and Beijing hoped of signing by the mid of last month, was saddled by a lack of agreement on tariffs’ rollback and on a new U.S. law that backed Hong Kong protesters.  Last month, regional gains were lead by New Zealand shares , which surged 4.9%, on improving outlook for local businesses.  “The significant easing in both interest rates and the exchange rate is clearly working its way through the economy, and the remarkable resilience of New Zealand’s commodity prices is providing an invaluable buffer to the world’s woes,” ANZ Bank said in a report last month.  Australia and Japan stocks also topped regional shares last month with 2.6% and 1.6% in monthly gains.  Economic data from the United States and Asian markets released during November, showed signs of recovery in global economic growth and supported regional shares last month.  The U.S. economy grew at a 2.1% annualised rate in the third quarter, up from 2.0% growth in the second quarter. China’s factory activity for November also showed an expansion with a PMI reading of 51.8, the quickest pace since December 2016.

That has led to worries that a withdrawal of billions of dollars of portfolio investment might itself exacerbate domestic economic ills and fuel even more anger on the street as foreign money vital for economic and jobs growth dries up.     Anti-government demonstrations in Hong Kong, Chile, Bolivia, Lebanon and elsewhere in recent months have proved as intense and durable as they were sudden and surprising.   The sharp market reaction has forced even seasoned money managers who pride themselves on an ability to navigate political risks often inherent in emerging markets to rethink.  Many work with in-house or external risk analysts to monitor everything from changes in taxation to social media to gauge the threat of civil strife, rebellion or even war.  The unrest confirmed that traditional risk measures like a sovereign’s willingness to pay its debts, or political stability, do not always fully capture the early signs of disorder and is hastening greater interest in broader indicators. Those might include internet freedom, and even the gender balance in school classrooms.  “It’s really about thinking where the next bit of unrest could occur and trying to preempt that,” said Richard House, CIO emerging market debt, Allianz Global Investors, which has 535 billion euros of assets under management. “Any whiff of unrest in these markets and that has a big impact on asset prices.”  Some asset prices have seen sharp collapses. Lebanon’s bonds trade at less than half their face value, Hong Kong stocks have tumbled around 13% since April and Chile’s peso hit record lows.  Popular discontent in Chile, which has enjoyed consistent economic growth and rising prosperity for years, came as a particular surprise. Indicators designed to flag such a possibility were found wanting when riots erupted in October.   With solid investment-grade credit ratings, Chile was ranked 18th out of 60 countries in BlackRock’s Sovereign Risk Index, which measures factors like debt levels and financial sector strength.  “We of course went immediately ‘what was our AI telling us about?’, and especially as this was a very solid country where institutions are very strong,” said Sergio Trigo Paz, head of emerging markets fixed income at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager.   Chile was an exception to the recent pattern of unrest, which tends to happen in the “fragile middle” nations which are semi-autocracies or weak democracies, said James Lockhart Smith, head of financial sector risk at Verisk Maplecroft.  Pembroke Emerging Markets trimmed its investments in Chile this month, having previously taken short positions on retailers there in expectation that consumer spending might suffer due to lower prices of copper, its main export.  “One of the things we’ve learned is that things change rapidly and when visibility becomes low it’s better to take smaller positions,” said Pembroke CIO Sanjiv Bhatia.   Particularly since protests flared, Pembroke regularly reviews the country risk analysis part of the criteria it uses to determine investment decisions, he said.  Investors are seeking common threads between the protests, such as wealth disparity, unemployment and lack of political voice, to help identify countries that may be vulnerable to similar instability.  “Most Middle East countries have very young populations, high income inequality, so we’re avoiding places like Jordan and Oman which have similar demographics to places like Lebanon and Iraq,” said Allianz’s House.  Allianz cut its exposure to Colombia before recent strikes there began.  BNP Paribas Asset Management, with 436 billion euros in assets under management, was already mostly out of Bolivia and Venezuela before events escalated thanks to its own assessment matrix, said Bryan Carter, head of emerging market fixed income.  “Can we imagine military dictatorships coming back in Latin America or going back to the 80s and the 90s? That is completely unimaginable in a country like Chile, no way. But in Bolivia, I don’t know if I would say that so quickly,” he said.  It is not clear yet if the unrest has sparked a broad retrenchment. Chile saw equity outflows of $24.2 million in October but a partial rebound in the month to Nov. 22.   Emerging market equity funds lost $3.2 billion in October when protests erupted in Ecuador, Bolivia and Lebanon, but nearly half has since returned. Bond funds added $3.7 billion in October, then lost $326.1 billion in November.  The unrest has raised scrutiny of countries with high levels of violence, discrimination against women, corruption or weak rule of law, which have been among protesters’ concerns.   “It reinforces the premise that country selection matters, nowhere more than in EMs, where freedom levels vary so widely between countries,” said Perth Tolle, founder of Life + Liberty Indexes, a freedom-weighted emerging market equity strategy.   Tolle cited clients considering cutting China exposure, in part because of Beijing’s response to the Hong Kong protests. 	Reuters

The survey seems to suggest domestic demand is pretty strong even if one cannot have unrestrained optimism on the economic outlook,” said Naoki Tashiro, president of T.S. China Research.  While U.S. legislation supporting Hong Kong protesters last week raised concerns about U.S.-China trade negotiations, investors are nonetheless holding the broad view that a further escalation in the trade war can be avoided.  “It looks a bit difficult for two countries’ leaders to shake hands and sign a deal this month. What is more likely is to essentially kick the can, with China buying more U.S. farm products while the U.S. postpones its next tariffs,” said Hiroyuki Ueno, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management.  “Markets will consider such an arrangement as a de facto deal whether they officially sign it or not,” he said.  Investors have long thought that the United States will avoid imposing an additional 15% tariff on about $156 billion of Chinese products on Dec. 15 after signing a deal with China.  The two countries have been so far unable to bridge the gap over existing tariffs on Chinese goods, with Beijing demanding scrapping them as a part of any trade deal.  A trade deal between United States and China was now “stalled because of Hong Kong legislation”, news website Axios reported on Sunday, citing a source close to U.S. President Donald Trump’s negotiating team.  China’s Foreign Ministry last week lambasted U.S. legislation signed by President Donald Trump on Wednesday backing protesters in Hong Kong as a serious interference in Chinese affairs.

The market drew support from expectations that OPEC and its allies are likely to extend existing oil output cuts when they meet this week , with non-OPEC oil producer Russia supporting Saudi Arabia’s push for stable oil prices amid the listing of state oil giant Saudi Aramco.  Iraq’s oil minister said on Sunday that OPEC and allied producers will consider deepening their existing oil output cuts by about 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 1.6 million bpd. 	Reuters

Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled down $1.44 at $62.43 a barrel, and was down 1.5% on the week. Still, the contract posted its biggest monthly gain since April with a rise of about 6%.  West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures CLc1 settled down $2.94 at $55.17, falling of 4.1% on the week, after three consecutive increases. On a monthly basis, WTI is poised for a jump of about 2.3%, its highest since June.  Trading volumes were low due after Thursday’s U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday.  Both benchmarks rose in November partly on expectations of the United States and China reaching an initial deal trade deal by the year-end, that could lift doubts over future demand for crude, along with it the health of the global economy.  However, that has started to look less likely after China warned the United States on Thursday it would take “firm counter measures” in response to U.S. legislation backing anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.  Prices have also been supported ahead of next week’s meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia, as the group known as OPEC+ is expected to extend existing oil output cuts until mid-2020.     Moscow is supporting Saudi Arabia’s push for stable oil prices amid the listing of state oil giant Saudi Aramco, and next week’s gathering coincides with the planned announcement of the final pricing for Aramco’s 2222.SE initial public offering.   Investors, however, were also eyeing whether the producer group would agree to deeper cuts.  “The bottom line is some people are looking for OPEC+ to cut production, and I don’t think that’s going to happen,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. If the cuts fall short of expectations or last only a few months, the market will sell off, he said.   OPEC+ agreed to reduce supply by 1.2 million barrels per day in 2019 through to March as U.S. output continues to climb to record levels.  OPEC’s share of that cut is 800,000 bpd among the 11 members participating in the deal. A Reuters survey on OPEC output indicates that total OPEC output fell by 110,000 bpd in November.  Russian oil companies on Thursday proposed to keep their output quotas unchanged, putting pressure on OPEC+ to avoid any major shift at the meeting over Dec. 5-6.   Crude prices have also faced pressure from growing U.S. output, which in September rose to a new record of 12.46 million bpd from 12.397 million bpd in August, the government said in a monthly report on Friday.   Oil supply from the North Sea, where crude differentials have been hitting several year highs [CRU/E], is set to increase in January, sending a bearish signal. [O/LOAD]  A Reuters poll of 42 economists and analysts forecast Brent to average $62.50 a barrel next year, little changed from last month’s $62.38 outlook, which was the lowest prediction for 2020 in about two years.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservatives now hold an 8 point lead over Labour, compared with 10 a week ago, according to a Panelbase poll.  The mid-caps snapped a five-day winning streak and shed 1%, their worst day in almost two months. JPMorgan’s basket of London-listed companies that make their cash at home skidded 2%.  Blue-chip banks RBS and Lloyds gave up 2.5% each, while retailers and housebuilders also eased as the main index slid 0.9%.  Markets have been buying into domestic shares amid hopes that Johnson, who has said that he will deliver Brexit by Jan. 31 if he retains power, will win a majority and put an end to 3-1/2 years of uncertainty over Britain leaving the bloc.  The poll exacerbated a decline in domestic firms after a survey earlier showed British consumer confidence reeling at its joint-lowest level since November 2013.  Johnson’s comment that he wanted to keep in place preparations the government has made for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit also fanned anxiety.  Bucking the trend, Ocado jumped 10% on its best day since February, after signing a technology partnership with Japan’s biggest supermarket operator, Aeon.  “The deal has settled investor nerves which had been showing signs of fraying on a lack of new partnerships and rumours of trouble with its Kroger marriage,” Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said.  Trading volumes were once again low with Wall Street working a half-day session after Thanksgiving.  Still, the FTSE moved further away from a near four-month high hit earlier this week, as trade-sensitive stocks fell on fears that the U.S. ratification of a law backing Hong Kong protesters would dent progress made in trade talks with China.  However, OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley said, given China’s issues around corporate debt and regional bank credit quality, the country could ill-afford to waste any progress made on trade talks.  Despite downbeat trading on Friday, the mid-caps enjoyed a third straight month of gains and the biggest since January. The blue-chip bourse also posted monthly gains for the eighth month this year.  Among small-caps, Reach soared 15% on its best day since November 2013, after the Daily Mirror publisher said it was confident of meeting annual targets.  Commercial vehicle rental firm Northgate tumbled 10% after a deal to buy accident claims handler Redde, which added 2.2%. 	Reuters

Dealers were charging a premium of up to $1.5 an ounce over official domestic prices this week, compared with a discount of $3 last week. The domestic price includes a 12.5% import tax and 3% sales tax.  “Jewellers are restocking due to price correction. The retail demand is still weak,” said Ketan Shroff, managing director of Mumbai-based bullion dealer Penta Gold.  Gold futures were trading around 37,800 rupees per 10 grams on Friday, down about 5% from a record high of 39,885 rupees in September.  A sharp drop in gold imports in the last few months has been allowing banks to charge a premium, but retail demand is lower-than usual, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a bullion importing bank.  Retail demand faltered after Diwali and could remain weak unless prices correct significantly, the bank dealer said.  Premiums in China were little changed at $2.3-$3.5 an ounce over the benchmark prices from last week’s $2-$3.50.  Demand in the world’s top bullion consumer has remained subdued mainly due its tariff war with the United States that has been dragging on their economic growth. Investors fear the new U.S. legislation backing Hong Kong protesters could disrupt efforts to end the trade war.  Premiums in Hong Kong, hit by anti-government protests, eased to 10-30 cents per ounce versus 30-50 cents in the prior week.  “It’s extremely quiet. Also, demand close to year-end is not that high. I don’t think demand is going to take off unless prices go below $1,400,” said Dick Poon, general manager at Heraeus Precious Metals in Hong Kong.  International spot gold prices are on track to post their biggest monthly decline in three years. Earlier in the week, bullion prices dropped to a two-week low of $1,450.30 an ounce.  There was some buying, especially from wholesalers, when prices dipped below $1,460 an ounce “but nothing to shout about” and there could be some increase in sales from promotions for Black Friday, said Brian Lan, managing director at Singapore dealer GoldSilver.  Singapore premiums were quoted around 50-80 cents compared with 50-60 cents last week. 	Reuters

MSCI’s stock index for emerging markets fell nearly 1%, extending losses to the second straight session after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law on Wednesday legislation that supported the protesters, a move that China said it would retaliate against.  “Market sentiment is likely to remain fragile, as China has already threatened retaliation measures in reaction to the bill being passed,” said Thu Lan Nguyen, FX strategist at Commerzbank. “There is still the risk of a set-back in the short term.”  Hong Kong stocks led declines among Asian shares as caution prevailed on the trade front, while pro-democracy protesters geared up for more rallies over the weekend.  The Turkish lira strengthened after the central bank said credit growth is expected to become widespread as a result of its required reserves framework, as well as favourable economic conditions.  “Turkey’s central bank is right now pursuing an expansionary policy, so the focus still remains on revamping credit growth,” said Cristian Maggio, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities.  South Africa’s rand also firmed against the dollar on Friday ahead of trade and monthly government budget balance figures due later in the session.  Central bank data showed growth in South Africa’s private sector credit quickened in October from the previous month.  Forex trading has turned risk-averse in the recent few weeks as relatively strong economic indicators out of the United States boosted the dollar. MSCI’s index for emerging-markets currencies is now on track to fall for its third week in a row.  The Hungarian, Polish and Czech currencies were trading sideways against the euro.

The benchmark Nikkei average dropped 0.5% to 23,293.91 but were up 1.6% for the month. For the week, it eked out a 0.8% gain, to mark its first weekly rise in three weeks.  U.S. S&P 500 mini futures were last down 0.3%. New York markets were shut on Thursday for Thanksgiving holiday and many investors kept to the sidelines on Friday, waiting to see how U.S. markets perceive the latest clash between Washington and Beijing over Hong Kong.  China warned the United States on Thursday it would take “firm counter measures” in response to U.S. legislation backing anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.  Slides in Hong Kong and mainland Chinese shares soured investor sentiment in the afternoon session, analysts said. The Hang Seng index was last down 2.0%.  “The question is what real actions Beijing will take. The working assumption for most investors is that this will not derail the trade talks, given China is suffering from an economic slowdown,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.  The broader Topix slipped 0.5% to 1,699.36, with all but three of its 33 subsectors finishing in negative territory.  Restaurant search website operators Kakaku.com Inc slid 3.2% and Gurunavi Inc slumped 3.9% after media reported that Japan’s antitrust watchdog has been investigating major restaurant finders over alleged unfair booking practices.  On a positive note, the dollar last traded at 109.48 versus the yen, not far from its six-month peak of 109.61 marked on Wednesday, and provided some support to export-oriented firms as a softer yen boosts overseas profits when repatriated.

MSCI All Country world index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was down 0.39% at 548.48, less than 0.4% away from all-time peak hit in January last year before the start of U.S.-China trade war.  European stocks look set to start Friday lower with pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures down 0.3% in early trade, following a bleak Asian morning session.  MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell more than 1%. Hong Kong led the dip with losses of 2%. South Korean shares lost 1.4% and Japan’s Nikkei eased 0.5%.  China’s blue-chips gave up 1.3% a day before the country reports manufacturing activity, which analysts polled by Reuters expect to have shrunk for seventh straight month in November.  Markets were sold off due to uncertainty over how U.S. markets will perceive the latest clash between Washington and Beijing over Hong Kong.  Traders on Wall Street will commence a half-day session on Friday following Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday. U.S. S&P 500 mini futures were down 0.3%.  China warned the United States on Thursday it would take “firm counter measures” in response to U.S. legislation backing anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.  Anthony Chan, chief Asia investment strategist at Union Bancaire Privée in Hong Kong, said the market is still erring on the side of caution especially as the year-end approaches.  “There is still downward pressure on earnings. That’s why when there is (negative) geopolitical news, some funds might want to sell and lock in their performance,” he said.  But on the whole, investors are now betting that while the U.S. legislation spoils the mood, ultimately it remained in the interest of both Washington and Beijing to move forward with talks to get a trade deal.  “The working assumption for most investors is that this will not derail the trade talks, given China is suffering from an economic slowdown,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.  Sentiment in the region has enjoyed an additional boost from a strong share performance this week by Alibaba Group, Asia’s largest firm by market capitalisation. Alibaba has risen as much as 16% since their IPO in Hong Kong on Tuesday.  Major currencies were kept in tight ranges amid a dearth of any other significant developments in Sino-U.S. trade talks.  Against the yen, the dollar traded at 109.46 yen, near its six-month peak of 109.61 set on Wednesday.  The euro stood at $1.1009, stuck in a tight range for the past week.  The British pound traded at $1.2916, staying in its $1.28-1.30 range since mid-October.  As trading in major currencies slumbers, their implied volatilities, key gauges of expected swings measured by their option prices, plumbed to new record lows this week.  Among emerging currencies, the Chilean peso’s 3.5% plunge this week to an all-time low, and brought its decline during November to 10% following protests over inequality that turned violent again this week.  In response, the central bank said it would start a six-month programme of foreign currency sales from Monday in a bid to stabilise the peso, earmarking $20 billion for the programme.

Senior members of Hong Kong Polytechnic University toured buildings strewn with debris after police left, including a sports hall and a ruined Starbucks outlet, seeing smashed windows and charred piles of former barricades.  After more than five months of increasingly violent demonstrations, the Chinese-ruled city has enjoyed relative calm since local elections on Sunday delivered an overwhelming victory to pro-democracy candidates.  Activists are trying to keep up momentum, after winning backing from U.S. President Donald Trump that has renewed global attention on the Asian financial hub and infuriated Beijing.  “Many classrooms, laboratories and library were destroyed. Even so, there’s been no loss of life. We insisted on adopting a humane way to solve the crisis,” university president Teng Jin-Guang told reporters, saying the next semester would go ahead on time.  Located on Kowloon peninsula, the campus became a battleground earlier this month when protesters barricaded themselves in and fought riot police in a hail of petrol bombs, water cannon and tear gas.   Police arrested more than 1,300 people during the turmoil at the university, Kwok Ka-chuen, a senior police official, told reporters on Friday. A total of 5,890 people have been arrested since early June, he added.  Before police left, they seized nearly 4,000 Molotov cocktails and hundreds of bottles of chemicals, Kwok said.  At one point on Friday, a man and woman emerged from the campus wearing black face masks and walked out hand-in-hand, with no sign of police.   Demonstrators are angry at what they see as Chinese meddling in freedoms promised when Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies interfering, says it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula put in place at that time, and has blamed foreign forces for fomenting unrest.  Beijing warned Washington of “firm counter measures” after Trump signed legislation supporting the protesters on Wednesday.   On a visit to Bangkok, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Friday tried to reassure the Thai government and businesses that her city was still an attractive financial hub.  The anti-government protests have at times forced businesses, government, schools and even the international airport to close. The unrest has hit the economy, with data on Friday showing tourist arrivals fell 44% in October from a year earlier.  A few hundred protesters, some carrying Union Jack flags, gathered at the British consulate on Friday urging London to extend citizenship to Hong Kong residents born before the 1997 handover to China and classified as overseas British nationals.   They chanted “We are all Simon”, referring to a former consulate employee, Simon Cheng, who said Chinese secret police beat him and deprived him of sleep seeking information about activists behind the protests.  Hong Kong’s justice secretary has urged him to report the matter to the relevant Chinese authorities and said she has no opinion on the accusations.      Other demonstrations planned over the weekend include a rally by secondary school students, a protest against the use of tear gas near children, and a “march of gratitude” to the U.S. consulate.  A rally planned for Dec. 8 by Civil Human Rights Front, the group that organized million-strong marches in June, is likely to provide the best gauge of the democracy movement’s support.     	Reuters

MSCI All Country world index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, were up 0.08% at 548.88, only 0.3% away from all-time peak hit in January last year before the start of U.S.-China trade war.  MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.9%. Hong Kong led the losses, dropping 2.0%. South Korean shares lost 1.2% and Japan’s Nikkei eased 0.1%.  China’s blue-chips gave up 0.9% a day before the country reports manufacturing activity, which analysts polled by Reuters expect to have shrunk for seventh straight month in November.  Asian markets were sold off due to uncertainty over how U.S. markets will perceive the latest clash between Washington and Beijing over Hong Kong.  Traders on Wall Street will commence a half-day session on Friday following Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday. U.S. S&P 500 mini futures were down 0.26%.  China warned the United States on Thursday it would take “firm counter measures” in response to U.S. legislation backing anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.  Anthony Chan, chief Asia investment strategist at Union Bancaire Privée in Hong Kong, said the market is still erring on the side of caution especially as the year-end approaches.  “There is still downward pressure on earnings. That’s why when there is (negative) geopolitical news, some funds might want to sell and lock in their performance,” he said.  But on the whole, investors are now betting that while the U.S. legislation spoils the mood, ultimately it remained in the interest of both Washington and Beijing to move forward with talks to get a trade deal.  “The working assumption for most investors is that this will not derail the trade talks, given China is suffering from an economic slowdown,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.  Sentiment in the region has enjoyed an additional boost from a strong share performance this week by Alibaba Group, Asia’s largest firm by market capitalisation. Alibaba has risen as much as 16% since their IPO in Hong Kong on Tuesday.  However, major currencies were kept in tight ranges amid a dearth of any other significant developments in Sino-U.S. trade talks.  Against the yen, the dollar traded at 109.46 yen, near its six-month peak of 109.61 set on Wednesday.  The euro stood at $1.1010, stuck in a tight range for the past week.  The British pound traded at $1.2912, staying in its $1.28-1.30 range since mid-October.  As trading in major currencies slumbers, their implied volatilities, key gauges of expected swings measured by their option prices, plumbed to new record lows this week.  Among emerging currencies, the Chilean peso’s 3.5% plunge this week to an all-time low, and brought its decline during November to 10% following protests over inequality that turned violent again this week. In response, the central bank said it will start a six-month programme of foreign currency sales from Monday in a bid to stabilise the peso, earmarking $20 billion for the programme.  Oil prices were little changed on Friday but look set to have one of the best performances in recent months in November, with Brent futures up almost 6.0% month-on-month, which would be the biggest gain since April.

MSCI All Country world index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, were up 0.05% at 549.62, and would need to rise only 0.2% to reach all-time peak hit in January last year before the start of U.S.-China trade war.  MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan also ticked up 0.05% in early Friday trade while Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.27%.  U.S. S&P 500 mini futures were down 0.1%. New York markets were shut on Thursday for Thanksgiving holiday and with many investors seen away also on Friday, uncertainties remain on how U.S. markets will perceive the latest clash between Washington and Beijing over Hong Kong.  China warned the United States on Thursday it would take “firm counter measures” in response to U.S. legislation backing anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.  “Since the U.S. legislation was approved unanimously by the U.S. Senate and by all but one lawmaker in the House of Representatives, the law has been expected to take effect,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.  “It has been also expected that China will express harsh words against it. The question is what real actions Beijing will take. The working assumption for most investors is that this will not derail the trade talks, given China is suffering from an economic slowdown,” he said.  On the whole, investors are now betting that while the law spoils the mood it would not change the game, underpinning many risk assets.

One exception was the Chilean peso, which has plunged 3.5% so far this week to an all-time low, prompting the central bank to unveil $20 billion foreign currency interventions programme.  The peso has plummeted more than 10% this month following more than a month of protests over inequality that turned violent again this week.

Fading hopes of a rapprochement between the world’s two biggest economies before additional, potentially damaging tariff hikes kick in, also helped safe-haven assets such as U.S. and German bonds and lifted the yen from six-month lows.  The U.S. legislation, which threatens sanctions for human rights violations and seeks to safeguard Hong Kong’s autonomy, prompted China to warn of “firm counter measures”.  “The risk-off moves clearly reflect a concern this could be an impediment to the ‘Phase One’ trade deal which is now widely expected,” said Adam Cole, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets.  Wall Street’s main indexes closed at record levels for a third straight day on Wednesday, albeit in thin liquidity before the Thanksgiving holiday, after data showed U.S. economic growth had picked up in the third quarter and consumer spending had increased.  Elsewhere, though, the outlook for growth looks less rosy. Japanese retail figures slumped the most since 2015 as a sales tax hike dragged on the economy, exacerbating a slowdown caused by slowing exports and manufacturing.

134	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1Y12NB	November 27, 2019 /  11:08 PM / 4 months ago	Trump approves legislation backing Hong Kong protesters	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed into law congressional legislation backing protesters in Hong Kong despite angry objections from Beijing, with which he is seeking a deal to end a damaging trade war.  The legislation, approved unanimously by the U.S. Senate and by all but one lawmaker in the House of Representatives last week, requires the State Department to certify, at least annually, that Hong Kong retains enough autonomy to justify favorable U.S. trading terms that have helped it maintain its position as a world financial center.  The law also threatens sanctions for human rights violations.  Congress passed a second bill, which Trump also signed, banning the export to the Hong Kong police of crowd-control munitions, such as teargas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and stun guns.  “I signed these bills out of respect for President Xi (Jinping), China, and the people of Hong Kong. They are being enacted in the hope that Leaders and Representatives of China and Hong Kong will be able to amicably settle their differences leading to long term peace and prosperity for all,” Trump said in a statement.  At the heart of matter is Beijing’s promise to allow Hong Kong a “high degree of autonomy” for 50 years when it regained sovereignty over the city in 1997, a pledge that has formed the basis of the territory’s special status under U.S. law. Protesters say freedoms have been steadily eroded.  Trump had been vague about whether he would sign or veto the legislation, while trying to strike a deal with China on trade that he has made a top priority ahead of his 2020 re-election bid.  After Congress passed the bill, Trump’s aides debated whether the president’s endorsement could undermine efforts to reach an interim trade deal with China, and most of them ultimately recommended the signing to show support for the protesters, a person familiar with the matter said.  The decision was also influenced by the overwhelming majorities in the Senate and House in favor of the legislation, which was widely seen as making the bills veto-proof, as well as the landslide election victory in Hong Kong earlier this week of critics of Chinese rule, the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  If Trump had opted to use his veto, it could have been overridden by two-thirds votes in both the Senate and the House. The legislation would have automatically become law on Dec. 3 if Trump had opted to do nothing.  China has denounced the legislation as gross interference in its affairs and a violation of international law.  After the Senate passed the legislation, Beijing vowed counter-measures to safeguard its sovereignty and security.   Last week, Trump boasted that he alone had prevented Beijing from crushing the demonstrations with a million soldiers, while adding that he had told President Xi that doing so would have “a tremendous negative impact” on trade talks.  Trump prompted questions about his commitment to protecting Hong Kong freedoms when he referred in August to its mass street protests as “riots” that were a matter for China to deal with.  Trump again referred to “riots” last week, but has also called on China to handle the issue humanely.  Trump’s statement on the bill signing indicated that he was doing so with reservations about portions of the legislation, saying “certain provisions of the Act would interfere with the exercise of the president’s constitutional authority to state the foreign policy of the United States.”  Presidents often push back against such congressional measures, especially when they seek to mandate the imposition of sanctions, and use their signing statements to reinforce that they have the executive power to act at their discretion on foreign policy matters.  The person familiar with the matter said by publicly expressing such reservations Trump could be trying to assure the Chinese that he will not act to implement the toughest measures unless they sharply intensify their crackdown in Hong Kong.  Many see the U.S. legislation as symbolic, but the bills’ provisions have the potential, if implemented, to upend relations between the United States and Hong Kong and change the territory’s status to that of any other Chinese city.  Analysts say any move to end Hong Kong’s special treatment could prove self-defeating for the United States, which has benefited from the business-friendly conditions in the territory. If Hong Kong becomes just another Chinese port, companies that rely on the territory’s role as a middleman or for trans-shipping would likely take their business elsewhere.  That said, the bills contain strong waivers that would allow the president to block their provisions on national-security and national-interest grounds.  According to the State Department, 85,000 U.S. citizens lived in Hong Kong in 2018 and more than 1,300 U.S. companies operate there, including nearly every major U.S. financial firm.  Trade between Hong Kong and the United States was estimated to be worth $67.3 billion in 2018, with the United States running a $33.8 billion surplus - its biggest with any country or territory, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

The Nikkei share average fell 0.12% to 23,409.14, snapping a four-day winning streak while the broader Topix lost 0.17% to 1,708.06, with decliners outnumbering gainers by 1,416 to 628.  China warned the United States on Thursday it would take “firm counter measures” in response to U.S. legislation backing anti-government protesters in Hong Kong, saying attempts to interfere in the Chinese-ruled city were doomed to fail.  “In the near term, people are watching how China will react to Trump’s move,” said Masahiro Ayukai, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.  “But there is little change in the view that the global economic sentiment is bottoming out,” he added.  Against such a backdrop, some selected technology-related shares gained, with Hitachi rising 1.8% to hit a 1 1/2-year high.  Kyocera gained 1.9% to its best level since early 2018 while Fujitsu rose 1.1% to a 10-year high.  Panasonic rose 2.8% after the Nikkei business daily reported that the company plans to pull out from its small, money-losing semiconductor business.  On the other hand, some defensive shares lost their edge, with Central Japan Railway falling 1.6% and East Japan Railway down 1.1%.  Japan Display dropped 4.2% after the struggling panel maker said on Wednesday it would review its past earnings after a former accounting executive notified the company of a past accounting fraud which he said was directed by former top management.  Turnover dropped to 1.598 trillion yen, about 25 below the average over the past year due to U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.

"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law here congressional bills that back protesters in Hong Kong and threaten China with possible sanctions on human rights, prompting China's Foreign Ministry on Thursday to warn of ""firm counter measures"".  Mass protests for more democracy and autonomy have rocked the former British colony and more than 5,800 people have been arrested since June, with the escalating violence raising fears that China will ratchet up its response to end the unrest.

Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, and the territory was promised a “high degree of autonomy” for 50 years. Among the key drivers of the protests in Hong Kong is the widespread perception that Beijing has been steadily encroaching on that promised autonomy.

While many see the laws as symbolic, they have the potential to upend relations between the United States and Hong Kong.  China’s promise of “high degree of autonomy” for Hong Kong has formed the basis of the territory’s special status under U.S. law.  China has denounced the legislation as gross interference and violation of international law, and on Thursday labeled the United States the “biggest black hand” behind the unrest in Hong Kong.  The legislation comes at a time when Beijing and Washington are inching toward a “phase one” agreement to begin to defuse a bruising trade war that Trump has made a top priority.  Beijing has signaled that it wants to keep the Hong Kong issue out of the trade war discussions, but the new laws will exacerbate tensions in the bilateral relationship.  Separately, some analysts say any move to end Hong Kong’s special treatment could prove self-defeating for the United States, which has benefited from the business-friendly conditions in the territory.  If Hong Kong becomes just another Chinese port, this could hurt not just the city and China, but U.S. businesses too, and companies that rely on the territory’s role as a middleman, or for trans-shipping, would likely take their business elsewhere.  From a business perspective, one of the most important elements of Hong Kong’s special status has been that it is considered a separate customs and trading zone from China.  That has meant, for instance, that trade-war tariffs don’t apply to exports from Hong Kong.  According to the State Department, 85,000 U.S. citizens lived in Hong Kong in 2018 and more than 1,300 U.S. companies operate there, including nearly every major U.S. financial firm.  The territory is a major destination for U.S. legal and accounting services and in 2018 the largest U.S. bilateral trade-in-goods surplus was with Hong Kong at $31.1 billion.

The yuan fell in offshore trade as scrutiny of Hong Kong’s response to months of often violent protest against Chinese rule of the former British colony potentially opens up a new fault line in already fractious relations between Washington and Beijing.  The Swiss franc and gold also rose on Thursday as investors sought safe-haven assets due to concern about a potential increase in geopolitical risk.  The focus now shifts to China’s reaction as investors try to gauge how much impact U.S. support of anti-government protests in Hong Kong will have on negotiations to scale back a 16-month long trade war between the world’s two-largest economies.  “The yen is being bought because of the news about Trump signing the Hong Kong bill,” said Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.  “Algorithmic trading could push the yen up further, but the dollar’s losses will be limited because we’ve had positive U.S. economic data, which has lifted sentiment.”  The yen rose around 0.2% to 109.35 versus the dollar on Thursday in Asia, rebounding from a six-month low reached Wednesday after U.S. economic growth was revised up in the third quarter.  In the offshore market, the yuan fell 0.19% to 7.0290 per dollar.  Trump on Wednesday signed a bill that requires the State Department to certify, at least annually, that Hong Kong retains enough autonomy to justify favourable U.S. trading terms which have helped it maintain its position as a global financial hub.  The law also threatens sanctions for human rights violations in Hong Kong, which has been rocked by months of civil unrest in response to what protesters say is an erosion of freedoms since reverting to Chinese rule in 1997.  Beijing has denied any undue influence and has blamed foreign governments for meddling it Hong Kong’s affairs.  Many see the U.S. legislation as symbolic, but it has the potential, if implemented, to upend relations between the United States and Hong Kong and change the territory’s status to that of any other Chinese city.  The U.S. rebuke comes at a sensitive time because U.S. and Chinese negotiators are trying to reach an agreement to de-escalate a trade war, which would remove a huge headwind from the global economic outlook.  Washington and Beijing have imposed tariffs on each other’s goods in a prolonged dispute over Chinese trade practices that the U.S. government says is unfair.  Investor uncertainty benefited the Swiss franc, which pulled back from a two-month low to trade at 0.99875 against the greenback.  Gold, another safe haven bought in times of uncertainty, rose 0.13% to $1,456.15 per ounce.  The rise in safe havens undermined the dollar, which came into Asian trade on a high after revised data showed U.S. economic growth picked up slightly in the third quarter. 	Reuters

Antonio Simoes also said the London-headquartered bank aims to increase its onshore presence in China, home to an eighth of all billionaires’ wealth worldwide and where it is one of the few global banks to operate a private banking business.  “The strategy to achieve double-digit asset and revenue growth is working,” said Simoes, who assumed his role in January. “And as part of that, Asia is by far the region that is growing the most.”  With higher economic growth, rapidly rising wages and a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem producing rich clients at a pace faster than the West, Asia has emerged as the main battleground for global wealth managers.  Assets managed by HSBC’s private banking unit rose 9.4% in the first nine months of 2019 to $338 billion, while revenue rose 4.6% versus the same period a year earlier to $1.4 billion. The unit is the smallest contributor to group revenue at 3%.  Asia accounts for 42% of HSBC’s total private banking assets, making it the single largest market. The region also accounts for the biggest share of the bank’s overall revenue.  But six months of often violent pro-democracy protests that have convulsed Hong Kong - one of Asia’s two main wealth management hubs along with Singapore - have triggered concern about rich clients looking for alternative centres.  Simoes, however, said his business in the Chinese territory had not been impacted.  “Our third-quarter results showed very resilient performance for Hong Kong against the backdrop of what’s happening,” he said. “From a private banking perspective, we continue to have targets for Hong Kong that are very ambitious.”  Simoes said the private banking business was sticking to its target announced last year of adding 700 people to its Asia unit by 2022 from a headcount of 1,100 at the end of 2017. Three hundred bankers have already been hired so far, he said.  HSBC’s private banking growth plans come as interim CEO Noel Quinn reviews the lender’s worldwide businesses as part of an audition for the full-time role under Chairman Mark Tucker.  Global wealth managers looking to grow in China - where HSBC’s unit is present onshore in Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou - continue to consider an offshore business as the preferred route due to regulatory restrictions on investment products and a lack of sizeable physical branch networks.  “Going forward, we want to be bigger in onshore China and we are looking at how to do that as regulations change,” Simoes said.  “If you take a 10-year view, we will need to be bigger in onshore China.” 	Reuters

Shares fell as much as 8% after the company also reported its first same-store sales drop in at least eight quarters at Hollister, a brand that has powered much of the retailer’s growth.   Abercrombie joins a growing list of American retailers that have called out months of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong for causing store closures and hurting revenue from the Asian shopping hub.  The company, which earns about 32% of its revenue from international markets, also said on a conference call that protests in Spain and France, as well as uncertainty around how Britain leaves the European Union, dampened demand in Europe.  The Ohio-based company said it now expects net sales to be in the range of flat to up 1% for the full year, compared with a previous range of flat to up 2%.  Abercrombie has in the past relied on Hollister to generate the bulk of its revenue with its denim and Gilly Hicks lingerie  collections, but the surfwear-themed brand is no longer attracting as much demand from younger customers.  “Their fashion was a little bit off course for their customer” said Gabriella Santaniello, founder of retail research firm A-Line Partners.  “Hollister was sort of their golden child ... (so) the reversal in the sales trends there is a bit concerning.”   Same-store sales at Hollister dropped 2% in the quarter, while analysts on average had estimated a 0.20% rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.   Sluggish demand for Hollister offset a 3% rise in comparable stores sales at Abercrombie unit, while international comparable sales fell 8%.  The company also said U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports are expected to impact merchandise cost and gross profit by about $4 million in the fourth quarter and about $5 million in the full year.   The teen apparel maker said the current forecast assumes 16% of goods will be made in China, down from about 25% in fiscal 2018.   Net income attributable to the company fell to $6.5 million from $23.9 million a year earlier.  Excluding items, the company earned 23 cents per share, narrowly missing analysts’ estimate of 24 cents.  Net sales rose marginally to $863.5 million, but also missed Wall Street estimates. 	Reuters

146	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1XZ2F7	November 25, 2019 /  9:01 PM / 4 months ago	How LVMH's whirlwind courtship sealed $16 billion Tiffany deal	LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Tiffany was codenamed “Tea” and LVMH was “Latte” in the whirlwind talks that led to the U.S. jeweler being taken over by the French luxury group for more than $16 billion, in a homage to famed film “Breakfast at Tiffany’s”.  The monikers were an attempt to ensure secrecy about a deal that LVMH wanted to seal swiftly before its competitors could intervene, according to two sources involved in the talks.  LVMH’s bid approach was discussed by executives at the two companies in mid October, soon before the French firm launched a big factory in Johnson County, Texas, with U.S. President Donald Trump cutting the ribbon at the opening ceremony.  On Oct. 15, LVMH (LVMH.PA) executives had flown to New York, seeking to negotiate an agreement before Tiffany (TIF.N) reported its next results in December, one of the sources said.   The urgency was driven by the fact that the Hong Kong protests and the U.S.-China trade war were expected to hit Tiffany’s results and drive down its share price, potentially luring industry rivals looking to exploit its weakness, said the source.  “It was important for LVMH to be the first-mover because, when you are the world number one, it is difficult for rivals to launch a bidding war,” he said.  The swoop was orchestrated by a trio of Italian businessmen, including LVMH managing director Antonio Belloni and Tiffany CEO Alessandro Bogliolo, who played a key role in LVMH’s 2011 acquisition of Italian jeweler Bulgari - the French group’s first foray into high-end jewelry.  LVMH’s billionaire boss Bernard Arnault, a renowned dealmaker, was himself focused on ensuring he was getting control of Tiffany’s most valuable assets: all the patented elements that came with the Tiffany brand, notably its robin’s egg blue boxes, the sources said.  “Bernard Arnault spent lots of time checking all the IPs and protections on the blue box. The most famous Tiffany product is actually its packaging, the color, the form, the white satin ribbon, all of this is protected,” said one of the sources close to LVMH.  Arnault nodded to this in a Reuters interview on Monday following the announcement of the deal.  “We’re the owner of a color,” the 70-year-old said. “It’s a pretty rare thing.”   LVMH is one of France’s most famous companies and its marquee brand Louis Vuitton is First Lady Brigitte Macron’s designer of choice, but its takeover of American giant Tiffany was essentially an Italian job.    For this deal, Arnault relied on the close-knit connections that his right-hand man Belloni had forged with Tiffany’s CEO Bogliolo and board member Francesco Trapani back in 2011 when the pair worked at Bulgari, the sources said.   Their established relationship helped move the deal along swiftly and gave LVMH an advantage in its approach to Tiffany that few rivals could have emulated, they added.  Belloni, 65, met Tiffany’s Bogliolo and Trapani almost a decade ago when he was leading LVMH’s 3.7 billion euro ($4.1 billion) acquisition of Bulgari.  Trapani, 62, was the boss of Bulgari at the time, a company he led for 28 years. He joined LVMH in 2012 to oversee Bulgari’s integration and then run LVMH’s watches and jewelry division, a job he quit in 2014.   Bogliolo, 54, was a senior executive at the Italian firm, reporting to Trapani.   It was Rome-born Trapani who set in train the process that culminated with Tiffany’s takeover. After amassing shares in the jeweler and backing an activist campaign, he ousted Tiffany’s then-CEO in 2017 and offered the top job to Bogliolo.   Bogliolo’s subsequent struggles to turn around Tiffany amid a slowdown in luxury spending were closely monitored by Belloni who proposed a mid-October meeting to discuss a tie-up, according to the sources.  Belloni tapped a senior Italian banker at Citi, Luigi De Vecchi, to handle the talks, hoping to reach an agreement by the Thanksgiving celebrations on Nov. 28, said one of the sources who is close to LVMH.  De Vecchi was familiar with all the parties involved having worked on the Bulgari deal while he was at Credit Suisse.  LVMH did not involve any French banks to negotiate its biggest-ever deal, with advisers in Paris pointing to Belloni’s long-standing relationship with De Vecchi as the main reason.   In the end, it took just over a month and three revised bids to get the Italian job done.  	Reuters
147	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1Y000P	November 26, 2019 /  12:14 AM / 4 months ago	Exclusive: China sets up Hong Kong crisis center in mainland, considers replacing chief liaison	HONG KONG/SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Tightening control over efforts to manage the upheaval in Hong Kong, the Chinese leadership has set up a crisis command center on the mainland side of the border and is considering replacing its official liaison to the restive semi-autonomous city, people familiar with the matter said.  As violent protests roil Hong Kong, top Chinese leaders in recent months have been managing their response from a villa on the outskirts of Shenzhen, bypassing the formal bureaucracy through which Beijing has supervised the financial hub for two decades.  Ordinarily, communications between Beijing and Hong Kong are conducted through a Chinese government body: the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government in Hong Kong. The Liaison Office is housed in a Hong Kong skyscraper stacked with surveillance cameras, ringed by steel barricades and topped by a reinforced glass globe.   In a sign of dissatisfaction with the Liaison Office’s handling of the crisis, Beijing is considering potential replacements for the body’s director, Wang Zhimin, two people familiar with the situation said. Wang is the most senior mainland political official stationed in Hong Kong.  The office has come in for criticism in Hong Kong and China for misjudging the situation in the city. “The Liaison Office has been mingling with the rich people and mainland elites in the city and isolated itself from the people,” a Chinese official said. “This needs to be changed.”  The Liaison Office may face increased pressure after city voters delivered a resounding defeat to pro-Beijing parties in local district elections on Sunday. Pro-democracy candidates won almost 90 percent of the seats, securing their first ever majority after running a campaign against Beijing’s perceived encroachments on Hong Kong’s liberties.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ Office in Hong Kong called the report “false”, without elaborating, in a statement posted on its website Tuesday. “No matter how the situation in Hong Kong changes, the Chinese government’s determination to safeguard national sovereignty, security, and development interests is unwavering,” it said.  The statement said China was committed to the “one country, two systems” policy that governs Hong Kong’s affairs, and was opposed to “external forces” interfering in the city’s affairs.  The State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the Liaison Office in Hong Kong did not reply to faxed requests for comment. The office of Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam declined to comment for this story.  The crisis center is located at the secluded Bauhinia Villa, a property owned by the Hong Kong Liaison Office, according to sources and official media, and named after the orchid that adorns the Hong Kong flag and currency. The villa, located just across Hong Kong’s border with the mainland, has served as a crisis center before: Senior Chinese officials stayed at the resort during the pro-democracy “Occupy Central” protests that rocked Hong Kong in 2014.  Top mainland officials have been gathering at the leafy compound to plot strategy and issue instructions aimed at defusing the crisis, according to six people familiar with the matter. Beijing authorities have been summoning key Hong Kong officials to meet at the villa during the five months of the increasingly violent anti-government protests, the sources said.   Among those who have attended, two of the people said, is embattled city leader Carrie Lam, who in September dramatically scrapped the controversial extradition bill that had ignited the protests, with approval by China’s top leadership. Hong Kong police officials, business leaders and local pro-Beijing politicians have been summoned to the villa as well.  In an indication of the operation’s importance, Chinese President Xi Jinping is receiving daily written briefings from Bauhinia Villa, said two officials and another person familiar with the operation.  The mainland Chinese and Hong Kong officials interviewed for this article spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the matter.  A Shenzhen businessman with close ties to Chinese officials described the villa complex as a “frontline command center” that authorities are using as a base for coordinating and monitoring the Hong Kong situation in a secure environment. The complex is “packed with people,” the businessman said.   The establishment of the Shenzhen villa as a crisis center with a channel to top leader Xi points to the gravity and delicacy of the situation in Hong Kong, diplomats said.   Mass protests erupted in June over an extradition bill that would have allowed individuals to be sent for trial to the mainland, where justice is controlled by the ruling Communist Party. Beijing wants to restore order in the city, but without being seen to be calling the shots.   Though the extradition bill has been killed, the protests have grown angrier, powered by a broad perception that Beijing is meddling improperly in city affairs and by complaints of police brutality. Hong Kong is governed under a charter which grants British-style rule of law until 2047, and its high degree of autonomy is widely seen as key to its prosperity as an international financial hub.   City and mainland officials say the police response has been measured and that any violence has been initiated by extreme protesters.   The lakeside setting of the villa, in a wooded neighborhood, enables Beijing and Hong Kong officials to meet away from the glare of the Hong Kong media and the chaos of the city’s protest-clogged streets.  The use of Bauhinia Villa to manage the crisis sets up a supplementary channel to the system Beijing put in place to oversee Hong Kong after China regained control of the city from Britain in 1997.  The Liaison Office, which reports to China’s State Council, has long served as the platform for Beijing to radiate its influence in the city. The office fosters relationships with the Hong Kong government as well as establishment figures and an array of pro-Beijing and youth groups, including business and clan associations from Chinese provinces and regions.  “The Hong Kong situation has increasingly made Beijing authorities uncomfortable,” said Sonny Lo, a veteran Hong Kong political commentator. Their desire for security and discretion, he said, is “the reason they select Shenzhen rather than Hong Kong as a kind of parallel headquarters in dealing with the Hong Kong crisis.”  Senior Chinese officials initially tried to find a middle ground between not capitulating to the demands of the protesters, while trying to avoid a bloody crackdown that could damage the city’s stature as a business center, according to three of the people familiar with the Bauhinia operation. Beijing sought to give the impression it wasn’t intervening in Hong Kong even after a million people took to the streets on June 9, the people said.  Shortly after that show of mass defiance, however, the senior-most Chinese leader in charge of Hong Kong affairs took action. That official, Vice Premier Han Zheng, authorized Lam to communicate directly with his office, rather than going through the Liaison Office, according to a person briefed on the matter, effectively establishing a hotline.    Subsequently, vice minister-level officials with China’s Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of State Security, the Cyberspace Administration of China and other departments all visited the villa, three of the sources said, an indication of just how seriously Beijing took the situation.  The two most senior Chinese leaders overseeing Hong Kong have been using Bauhinia Villa to deal more closely with the local leaders of the restive city, while remaining behind the scenes.  One is Zhang Xiaoming, the head of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, which sits under China’s top policy making body, the State Council. He has been a regular presence at the villa during the crisis, according to two sources who met with him there. A third person who met Zhang at Bauhinia Villa said Zhang spoke in detail about the now-shelved extradition bill and its importance, as well as subsequent attempts by Beijing to quell the unrest.  The other is Vice Premier Han himself. A day after Hong Kong protesters blocked access to the city’s legislature on June 12, Han arrived at Bauhinia Villa and summoned Lam for a meeting, according to a person briefed on their discussions. Gathered at Bauhinia was a multi-departmental team of Chinese public security, cyber security and intelligence officers, as well as advisers on Hong Kong affairs, three sources said.  When Lam proposed a suspension of the bill at that meeting, Han agreed after talking with other leaders in Beijing, the person briefed on the meeting said. Lam then announced the suspension of the bill on June 15.   The Liaison Office and senior pro-Beijing politicians in the city “didn’t know about the withdrawal until close to the decision,” a senior Hong Kong official said.  The concession didn’t placate the protesters, who demanded a full and formal scrapping of the bill.  As the protests have persisted, Beijing has taken a more visible role in Hong Kong: Chinese aviation authorities called for Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways to suspend staff who supported or participated in the demonstrations, mainland paramilitary forces conducted exercises openly just across the border in Shenzhen, and China last week criticized a Hong Kong court ruling that overturned the city’s ban on face masks used by protesters, rare interference in the territory’s judiciary.  Bauhinia Villa has long been an outpost for mainland China’s dealings with semi-autonomous Hong Kong.   In addition to serving as a crisis center during the 2014 protests, the villa has been used as a low-key venue for Chinese officials to meet with city figures, with lodging facilities and ample space for conferences and events. Bauhinia Villa also has hosted delegations from the Hong Kong pro-establishment and pro-Beijing camps for training sessions and preparatory meetings before annual legislative sessions in Beijing. Another government-owned resort that hosts official functions, Kylin Villa, sits nearby.  Xi himself stayed in Bauhinia Villa before he took power in 2012 and planted a tree inside the lake-side resort.   Security is tight, with checkpoints, spiked fences topped with barbed wire and numerous surveillance cameras. At the back is a steep tree-covered hill ringed with fencing, while on another side lies a conference center. A Reuters journalist was turned away recently when he approached the property. 	Reuters

The siege at the Polytechnic University on the Kowloon peninsula appeared to be nearing an end with the number of protesters dwindling to a handful, days after some of the worst violence since anti-government demonstrations escalated in June.  Police chief Chris Tang, who took up the post this week, urged those remaining inside to come out.  “I believe people inside the campus do not want their parents, friends ... to worry about them,” Tang told reporters.  Those who remain say they want to avoid being arrested for rioting or on other charges, so hope to find some way to slip past the police or hide.  Sitting in the largely deserted campus, one holdout described how his girlfriend had pleaded with him to surrender to the police.  He had refused, he said, telling her she might as well find another partner because he would likely go to jail.  “A man has to abandon everything otherwise it’s impossible to take part in a revolution,” the protester told Reuters.  The U.S. Congress has passed legislation to back the Hong Kong protesters and threaten China with possible sanctions for human rights violations, angering Beijing. President Donald Trump, who is seeking a resolution to a tit-for-tat tariff trade war with Beijing, was vague on Friday when asked whether he would sign the bills.  Trump said in an interview with Fox News Channel that he told Chinese President Xi Jinping that crushing the protesters would have “a tremendous negative impact” on efforts to end the 16-month trade war.  “If it weren’t for me Hong Kong would have been obliterated in 14 minutes,” he said, without offering any evidence.  “He’s got a million soldiers standing outside of Hong Kong that aren’t going in only because I ask him please don’t do it, you’ll be making a big mistake, it’s going to have a tremendous negative impact on the trade deal and he wants to make a trade deal.”   The Polytechnic campus was so quiet on Friday you could hear the chants of Chinese People’s Liberation Army soldiers exercising on their nearby base.  Many levels of the buildings look like abandoned hideouts strewn with remains — rucksacks, masks, water bottles, cigarette butts, with security cameras smashed throughout. Lockers were stuffed with gas masks and black clothes, and a samurai sword lay on the ground where it was abandoned.  “We are feeling a little tired. All of us feel tired but we will not give up trying to get out,” said a 23-year-old demonstrator who gave his name as Shiba as he ate noodles in the protesters’ canteen.   A Reuters reporter saw six black-clad protesters holding hands walk toward police lines, while a first aid worker said two more surrendered later.  The protests snowballed from June after years of resentment over what many residents see as Chinese meddling in freedoms promised to Hong Kong when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  Protesters, who have thrown petrol bombs and rocks and fired bows and arrows at police, are calling for full democracy and an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality, among other demands.  Police have responded to the attacks with rubber bullets, tear gas, water cannon and occasional live rounds but say they have acted with restraint in life-threatening situations.  On Friday Hong Kong’s High Court said it would temporarily suspend its ruling that found a controversial law banning protesters from wearing face masks is unconstitutional.  The court said it would suspend its ruling for seven days while appeals processes proceeded.   Beijing has said it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula under which Hong Kong is governed. It denies meddling in its affairs and accuses foreign governments of stirring up trouble.  One older protester, who estimated only about 30 demonstrators remained at the university, said some had given up looking for escape routes and were making new weapons to protect themselves in case police stormed the campus.  There have been two days and nights of relative calm in the city ahead of district council elections that are due to take place on Sunday.   Tang said police would adopt a “high-profile” presence on Sunday and he appealed to protesters to refrain from violence so people feel safe to vote. 	Reuters

The comments add to growing worries that a Chinese crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong could further complicate the efforts by the United States and China to end a prolonged trade war that has roiled global markets and undercut global economic growth forecasts.   “We were hoping to have (a phase one) deal done by the end of the year. I still think that’s possible,” O’Brien told reporters at a security conference in Halifax.  “At the same time, we’re not going to turn a blind eye to what’s happening in Hong Kong or what’s happening in the South China Sea, or other areas of the world where we’re concerned about China’s activity,” he said.  He said that he hoped district elections in Hong Kong would proceed without violence. “That would be a good sign,” he said.  President Donald Trump on Friday said he had told Chinese President Xi Jinping that crushing the Hong Kong protesters would have “a tremendous negative impact” on efforts to reach an accord to end a 16-month trade war.  He has been vague about whether he would sign or veto U.S. legislation to back protesters in Hong Kong, and boasted that he alone had prevented Beijing from crushing the demonstrations with a million soldiers.  O’Brien said he had not spoken to Trump on Saturday about his decision on whether to sign the Hong Kong human rights bill and did not know what he would do, but noted that the president had until early December to decide. The legislation will automatically become law on Dec. 3 if Trump opts to do nothing.  “I think the bill passed with a pretty significant majority, so I’m sure that’s something the president is taking into consideration,” O’Brien said.   Asked what would be the reaction of the United States if China cracked down hard on the protests, O’Brien said on Saturday: “I’m hoping that doesn’t happen. We’ve already seen too much violence in Hong Kong.”  “The real question is what is the world prepared to do about China if there is that sort of a crackdown? The United States will do its part,” he said.   U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had said in October that U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators were working on nailing down a “phase one” trade deal text for their presidents to sign in November.  But the deal’s completion could slide into next year, trade experts and people close to the White House said this week, as Beijing presses for more extensive tariff rollbacks, and Washington counters with heightened demands of its own.

In one of his most grandiose statements yet over relations with China, Trump said he had told Chinese President Xi Jinping that crushing the Hong Kong protesters would have “a tremendous negative impact” on efforts to reach an accord to end a 16-month trade war between the United States and China.   “If it weren’t for me Hong Kong would have been obliterated in 14 minutes,” Trump told Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends” without offering any evidence.  “He’s got a million soldiers standing outside of Hong Kong that aren’t going in only because I ask him please don’t do it, you’ll be making a big mistake, it’s going to have a tremendous negative impact on the trade deal and he wants to make a trade deal,” Trump added, referring to Xi.       Trump was asked what he planned to do about calls for him to veto congressional legislation supporting the Hong Kong protesters that has angered China. He appeared to link it with the trade deal he has been seeking, but gave no clear answer.  “Look we have to stand with Hong Kong, but I’m also standing with President Xi. He’s a friend of mine. He’s an incredible guy. We have to stand.   “But I’d like to see them work it out. Okay? We have to see them work it out. But I stand with Hong Kong, I stand with freedom, I stand with all of the things that we want to do.   “But we also are in the process of making the largest trade deal in history and if we could do that that would be great ... If it weren’t for me thousands of people would have been killed in Hong Kong right now and you wouldn’t have any riots you’d have a police state.”  ‘OVERWHELMING VETO-PROOF MAJORITIES’  When Trump was later asked by reporters whether he would sign the Hong Kong legislation, which was passed unanimously in the Senate and received only one vote against in the House, he was again non-committal. “It’s being sent over. We’re going to take a very good look at it.”  The legislation would require the State Department to certify, at least annually, that Hong Kong retains enough autonomy to justify the favorable U.S. trading terms that have helped it maintain its position as a world financial center. It also threatens sanctions for human rights violations.    A veto by the president can be overridden by two-thirds votes in both the Senate and the House. The legislation will automatically become law on Dec. 3 if Trump opts to do nothing.   A person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that the president was likely to approve the Hong Kong legislation and its chief Senate sponsor, Republican Marco Rubio, predicted on Thursday that he would do so.   The White House did not provide any clarification of Trump’s comments.   The Dallas Morning News newspaper quoted Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz as saying Congress would override any veto.  “President Xi and the Chinese Communist Party cannot silence the United States Congress,” it quoted him as saying.   Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump’s ‘deference’ to Xi did not reflect the views of the American people or Congress.  “For a guy who promised to be tough on China, President Trump’s reliable deference to President Xi is all the more bewildering. Being tough on China when it comes to human rights will also help us win the battle on trade,” he said.   Months of increasingly violent street protests in Hong Kong have raised fears that China might send troops from the mainland to crush the unrest, but there has been no sign of the massive intervention Trump referred to.       In August, Beijing moved thousands of troops into Hong Kong in an operation state news agency Xinhua described as a routine “rotation.” The city’s government has said the mainland army is not part of Hong Kong police operations to quell the demonstrations.

On the grounds of the besieged Polytechnic University on the Kowloon peninsula, a dwindling number of protesters desperately sought a way out and others vowed not to surrender, days after some of the worst violence since anti-government demonstrations escalated in June.  One student protester who escaped the police cordon around the university without being arrested said on Saturday he had not expected the elections to go ahead.  “I don’t feel optimistic about the outcome at all,” he said, predicting that the discontent will only escalate. “I cannot see the end in sight.”  Just after midnight, a man dressed in a white shirt and face mask was led out by the hand by another man and taken into a nearby police van.  A small group of medics roamed the campus early on Sunday,  searching the buildings looking for remaining protestors believed to be holed up inside.   The city is under tight security as a record 1,104 people gear up to run for 452 district council seats in Sunday’s elections.  A record 4.1 million Hong Kong people, from a population of 7.4 million, have enrolled to vote, spurred in part by registration campaigns during months of protests.  For the first time, riot police will guard all polling stations in the city and almost all officers in the 31,000-strong force will be on duty, the South China Morning Post reported on Friday, citing a senior police source.  The source told the newspaper that the officers would seek to minimize their presence to avoid worrying voters.  Asked about the report, the police department would say only that it had been liaising with other departments to provide assistance, arrange “appropriate police force”, and ensure that the election was carried out smoothly and in an orderly manner.  At a Chinese People’s Liberation Army barracks that borders Polytechnic University, meanwhile, dozens of soldiers in riot gear were seen practicing drills, according to a Reuters witness.  The soldiers carried shields and wore helmets with face guards, and were glimpsed from a high building marching in formation on an inner parade ground not visible from the road.  PLA soldiers have not publicly engaged in anti-riot efforts on the streets of Hong Kong but such drills suggest a high degree of preparedness amid the current protests.  Both Chinese and Hong Kong leaders have repeatedly said that Hong Kong police can handle the situation but Beijing has more than doubled the number of troops in the city since late August, with up to 12,000 on bases scattered across the territory.  The protests snowballed from June after years of resentment over what many residents see as Chinese meddling in freedoms promised to Hong Kong when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  Beijing has said it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula by which Hong Kong is governed. It denies meddling in the affairs of Hong Kong, an Asian financial hub, and accuses foreign governments of stirring up trouble.  However, Australia’s Age newspaper reported on Saturday that an apparent Chinese intelligence service agent is seeking asylum in Australia after saying he had details on Beijing’s political interference in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia.  Young pro-democracy activists are running in some of the seats that were once uncontested and dominated by pro-Beijing candidates.   One pro-democracy candidate for the Wan Chai district council, Chris Chan, said the election would reflect public opinion after the upheaval of recent months.  “It is time for us to calm down and tell the government in a civilized way what we want to do,” he said.  One protester holding out at Polytechnic University, Ah Chung, was clad in a face mask and a red Polytechnic University track suit as he vowed to stay for the duration.  “I’ll continue to stay here, but hopefully not forever,” he said with a touch of humor.  Few protesters were still visible on the campus, and a visiting lawmaker said their number was so small that there is no need for the police to enter the campus.  Many of the remaining protesters were in hiding, fearful of possible arrest and wary of those urging surrender, said Woo Kwok Wang, the 22-year-old acting president of the university’s student union. He said he had been on the campus since Wednesday to provide support for the students.  Natasha Reyes from Medecins Sans Frontieres, which has had a presence on the campus since Tuesday, said their team of medics had been treating a dwindling group of protesters.   Standing at a makeshift medical station, she said, “They’ve been around in a highly stressful situation for several days now... I am concerned about the mental health.”  About 1,000 people have been arrested or registered by police in the university siege, about 300 of them younger than 18.  Police have set up high plastic barricades and a fence on the perimeter of the campus. Toward midday, officers appeared at ease, allowing citizens to mill about the edges of the cordon as neighborhood shops opened for business. Some roads next to the campus had reopened by Saturday afternoon.  Scores of construction workers worked at the mouth of the  Cross-Harbour Tunnel to repair toll booths smashed by protesters and clear debris from approach roads. 	Reuters

The siege at the Polytechnic University on the Kowloon peninsula appeared to be nearing an end with the number of protesters dwindling to a handful, days after some of the worst violence since anti-government demonstrations escalated in June.  Police chief Chris Tang, who took up the post this week, urged those remaining inside to come out.  “I believe people inside the campus do not want their parents, friends ... to worry about them,” Tang told reporters.  Those who remain say they want to avoid being arrested for rioting or on other charges, so hope to find some way to slip past the police or hide.  Sitting in the largely deserted campus, one holdout described how his girlfriend had pleaded with him to surrender to the police.  He had refused, he said, telling her she might as well find another partner because he would likely go to jail.  “A man has to abandon everything otherwise it’s impossible to take part in a revolution,” the protester told Reuters.  The U.S. Congress has passed legislation to back the Hong Kong protesters and threaten China with possible sanctions for human rights violations, angering Beijing. President Donald Trump, who is seeking a resolution to a tit-for-tat tariff trade war with Beijing, was vague on Friday when asked whether he would sign the bills.  Trump said in an interview with Fox News Channel that he told Chinese President Xi Jinping that crushing the protesters would have “a tremendous negative impact” on efforts to end the 16-month trade war.  “If it weren’t for me Hong Kong would have been obliterated in 14 minutes,” he said, without offering any evidence.  “He’s got a million soldiers standing outside of Hong Kong that aren’t going in only because I ask him please don’t do it, you’ll be making a big mistake, it’s going to have a tremendous negative impact on the trade deal and he wants to make a trade deal.”   The Polytechnic campus was so quiet on Friday you could hear the chants of Chinese People’s Liberation Army soldiers exercising on their nearby base.  Many levels of the buildings look like abandoned hideouts strewn with remains — rucksacks, masks, water bottles, cigarette butts, with security cameras smashed throughout. Lockers were stuffed with gas masks and black clothes, and a samurai sword lay on the ground where it was abandoned.  “We are feeling a little tired. All of us feel tired but we will not give up trying to get out,” said a 23-year-old demonstrator who gave his name as Shiba as he ate noodles in the protesters’ canteen.   A Reuters reporter saw six black-clad protesters holding hands walk toward police lines, while a first aid worker said two more surrendered later.  The protests snowballed from June after years of resentment over what many residents see as Chinese meddling in freedoms promised to Hong Kong when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  Protesters, who have thrown petrol bombs and rocks and fired bows and arrows at police, are calling for full democracy and an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality, among other demands.  Police have responded to the attacks with rubber bullets, tear gas, water cannon and occasional live rounds but say they have acted with restraint in life-threatening situations.  On Friday Hong Kong’s High Court said it would temporarily suspend its ruling that found a controversial law banning protesters from wearing face masks is unconstitutional.  The court said it would suspend its ruling for seven days while appeals processes proceeded.   Beijing has said it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula under which Hong Kong is governed. It denies meddling in its affairs and accuses foreign governments of stirring up trouble.  One older protester, who estimated only about 30 demonstrators remained at the university, said some had given up looking for escape routes and were making new weapons to protect themselves in case police stormed the campus.  There have been two days and nights of relative calm in the city ahead of district council elections that are due to take place on Sunday.   Tang said police would adopt a “high-profile” presence on Sunday and he appealed to protesters to refrain from violence so people feel safe to vote. 	Reuters

European shares were expected to rise as well. In early European trades, pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures were up 0.14% at 3,687, German DAX futures were up 0.15% at 13,178, and FTSE futures were up 0.35% at 7,255.  U.S. S&P 500 e-mini futures, were 0.16% higher at 3,109.  On Friday afternoon, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.2%.  Markets showed little reaction to President Xi Jinping’s reiteration on Friday that China wants to work out an initial trade agreement with the United States and has been trying to avoid a trade war, but it is not afraid to retaliate when necessary.  The index had dropped as much as 1.4% on Thursday, taking it to its lowest level since Oct. 30, on worries that U.S. legislation on Hong Kong threatened to undermine trade talks between the world’s two largest economies.  Those concerns linger, with U.S. President Donald Trump expected to sign into law two bills backing protesters in Hong Kong after the U.S. House of Representatives voted 417 to 1 for the “Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act”, which the Senate had passed unanimously a day earlier.  “If he’s going to be forced to sign it, then it brings another (element) of uncertainty to this phase one trade deal, which then pushes back into next year,” said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at GAIN Capital in Singapore.  But Simpson said that in the absence of major news on trade, rangebound market moves are “quite reflective of the small headlines coming through”.  Chinese blue-chip shares, which had opened higher, turned negative, and were last down 0.68%.  Australian shares gained 0.55% and Japan’s Nikkei was up 0.46%.  Worries that a “phase one” trade deal between the United States and China might not occur until next year had weighed on investor sentiment on Wall Street overnight, pulling the S&P 500 down 0.16% to 3,103.54, the Dow Jones down 0.2% to 27,766.29 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.24% lower to 8,506.21.  The losses, though, were tempered by China saying it was willing to work with the United States to resolve core trade concerns, and a report in the Wall Street Journal that China has invited top U.S. trade negotiators for a new round of face-to-face talks in Beijing.  “It’s fair to say that some signs of trade-headline fatigue are emerging in markets,” analysts at ANZ said in a note.  U.S. Treasury yields were a shade higher.  The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 1.7774%, up from its U.S. close of 1.772% on Thursday. The policy-sensitive two-year yield was at 1.607% compared with a U.S. close of 1.605%.  In currency markets, the yen was barely stronger, with the dollar buying 108.62. The euro was up 0.06% at $1.1066.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was off 0.05% at 97.941.  Oil prices retreated after hitting two-month highs following a Reuters report that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are likely to extend existing output cuts until mid-2020.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude dipped 0.75% to $58.14 a barrel and global benchmark Brent crude was down 0.64% at $63.56 per barrel. 	Reuters

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.12%, recovering from Thursday’s drop of as much as 1.4% that took it to its lowest level since Oct. 30 on concerns that U.S. legislation on Hong Kong threatened to undermine trade talks between the world’s two largest economies.

164	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N2820IW	November 22, 2019 /  2:04 AM / in 4 months	Handful of Hong Kong protesters surrender as university siege staggers on	HONG KONG, Nov 22 (Reuters) - At least eight protesters who had been holding out at a trashed Hong Kong university surrendered to police in the early hours of Friday, while others desperately searched for escape routes as riot officers surrounded the campus.  The siege at the Polytechnic University on the Kowloon peninsula appeared to be nearing an end with the number of protesters dwindling to less than 100, days after some of the worst violence since anti-government demonstrations escalated in June.  The mood on the near-deserted campus was calm as the sun rose after a night where some protesters roamed the grounds in search of undercover officers. Others hid, terrified they would be arrested by infiltrators.  “We are feeling a little tired. All of us feel tired but we will not give up trying to get out,” said a 23-year-old demonstrator who gave his name only as Shiba as he ate noodles with egg and sausage in the protesters’ canteen.  “We spent yesterday trying to find ways to get outside but failed, so we came for some breakfast,” he said.  A Reuters reporter saw six black-clad protesters holding hands walk towards police lines, while a first aid worker said two more surrendered later.  Demonstrators are angry at what they see as Chinese meddling in freedoms promised to Hong Kong when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 and are calling for full democracy, among other demands.  Beijing has said it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula under which Hong Kong is governed. It denies meddling in Hong Kong affairs and accuses foreign governments, including Britain and the United States, of stirring up trouble.  One older protester, who estimated only around 30 demonstrators remained, said some had given up looking for escape routes and were now making new weapons to protect themselves in case police stormed the campus.  The Chinese-ruled city has enjoyed two days and nights of relative calm ahead of district council elections that are due to take place on Sunday.  The government has said it is committed to proceeding with the elections and is monitoring the situation to ensure the election can be held safely. 	Reuters

Brent crude LCOc1 ended the session up $1.57, or 2.5%, at $63.97 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 settled up $1.57, or 2.8%, to $58.58.   WTI touched a session high of $58.67 a barrel, the highest since Sept. 23 and Brent climbed to a high of $64.03, the highest since Sept. 24.   To support oil prices, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are likely to extend output cuts to June when they meet next month, according to OPEC sources.  OPEC meets on Dec. 5 at its headquarters in Vienna, followed by talks with a group of other oil producers, lead by Russia, known as OPEC+. The current supply cuts deal runs through to March 2020.  The sources told Reuters that formally announcing deeper cuts looked unlikely for now although a message about better compliance with existing curbs could be sent to the market.  Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday Russia and OPEC had “a common goal” of keeping the oil market balanced and predictable, and Moscow would continue cooperation under a global deal cutting oil supply.  “I think the market is pretty much resigned to the fact that economic growth is slowing as is the rate of increases in oil demand where forecasts having been revised lower continually... a lot of that bearishness has been priced in, so that the upcoming OPEC meeting and unrest in Iran and Iraq is becoming the focus,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.  “The market is well supplied and in my opinion, that will likely force OPEC and non-OPEC producers’ hand to extend their cuts through 2020.”  Unrest erupted on Nov. 15 in Iran after the government announced gasoline price hikes of at least 50%, and quickly turned political with protesters demanding top officials to step down.   In Iraq on Thursday, seven people were killed when security forces shot live fire and tear gas canisters at demonstrators in Baghdad, security and medical sources said, in renewed deadly violence as authorities seek to crush anti-government protests.  Also supportive for the markets, the Chinese commerce ministry said China will strive to reach an initial trade agreement with the United States as both sides keep communication channels open.      A Reuters report on Wednesday said completion of a “phase one” U.S.-China trade deal could slide into next year.  Amid the long-drawn trade war between the United States and China, U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign two bills passed by Congress intended to support protesters in Hong Kong, a move likely to anger China.  Hong Kong has seen increasingly violent protests against Chinese rule for several months and the passage of the bills could potentially undermine efforts to secure a trade deal.  “Positive speak from China is not offsetting expectations that President Trump will sign a bill supporting Hong Kong protesters,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.  “The timing of phase one deal is unclear, but markets are starting to get nervous we could see a repeat of the collapse in talks that took place in May.”      The Wall Street Journal also reported on Thursday that China had invited top U.S. trade negotiators for a new round of talks in Beijing, citing unnamed sources.

The U.S. House of Representatives passed two bills to back protesters in Hong Kong and send a warning to China about human rights, a measure which angered Beijing.  But China has invited top U.S. trade negotiators for a new round of face-to-face talks in Beijing, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing unnamed sources, adding Beijing hopes the round of talks can take place before next Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday in the United States.  This was the day after stocks sold off on a report that a Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal was not likely to happen this year. As a result investors were sticking to the sidelines for fear of missing out if relations were to improve, but keeping in mind that Wall Street’s indexes were still near record highs.  “The fulcrum of this optimism see-saw is the prospects for the phase 1 trade agreement. Investors are pulling petals from a daisy saying, ‘it’ll happen this year, it won’t,’” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.  “They are basically saying we’ve pushed this as far as we can. Valuations appear stretched at 18.5 times forward earnings compared with the 20-year average forward P/E Of 16.5,” he said.

Six out of the S&P 500’s 11 major industry sectors rose on the day with energy showing the biggest gain at 1.4% as oil prices rose on hopes that the OPEC and its allies were likely to extend output cuts until mid-2020..  Real estate showed the biggest decline at 1% and technology was the biggest drag on the benchmark index.  Shares in TD Ameritrade Holding Corp surged 18% after CNBC reported bigger rival Charles Schwab Corp was in talks to buy the discount brokerage. Schwab’s shares gained 6.8%.  Tiffany & Co gained about 2.3% after a Reuters report that LVMH persuaded the jewelry chain to allow it to access its books following a raised bid.  Economic data was mixed on Thursday. The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits was unexpectedly unchanged at a five-month high last week, suggesting some softening in the labor market.  But U.S. home sales increased more than expected in October and house prices rose at the fastest pace in more than two years amid lower mortgage rates and a shortage of properties for sale.

Trade talks came under pressure late on Wednesday when the U.S. House of Representatives passed two bills to back protesters in Hong Kong and send a warning to China about human rights, a measure which angered Beijing.

U.S. stock index futures erased losses after a report that the United States could delay tariffs on Chinese imports even if a deal was not reached by Dec. 15, when tariffs kick in on goods including items such as electronics and Christmas decorations. (bit.ly/2rhuyV7)  “This just shows that the trade deal is not dead and that we will get some sort of an extended truce, which is a positive,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.  “Investors are looking for a ‘phase one’ deal and the news right now points to that.”  Chipmakers with a large revenue exposure to China, including Intel Corp, were largely flat in premarket trade.  Wall Street’s moves this year have been largely dictated by headlines on trade, with expectations building in recent weeks of at least a partial agreement between the world’s top two economies.  However, all three major indexes ended the last session in the red after a record run this month on a report that the deal could be delayed to next year.

A report on Thursday said China had invited top U.S. trade negotiators for a new round of face-to-face talks in Beijing, soothing investor nerves after Reuters reported on Wednesday that the trade deal could slide into next year.  A U.S. bill in support of Hong Kong, which President Donald Trump is expected to sign into law, also dulled the mood as China vowed strong measures to safeguard its sovereignty and security.  Wall Street ended the previous session in the red after a record run in recent weeks on an upbeat earnings season and expectations of the trade agreement, which Trump had said last month could be signed by mid-November.  Semiconductor companies that have a sizeable revenue exposure to China fell premarket, with Intel Corp logging the biggest drop among the few Dow Jones components active before the bell.  Apple Inc, on the other hand, edged up 0.4%, as Trump said he was considering whether to exempt the iPhone maker from tariffs on imports from China.

The United States and China have been tangled in a trade war over the last two years that have resulted in bouts of tit-for-tat tariffs, rocking financial markets and threatening to pressure global growth.  Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing trade experts and people close to the White House, that negotiations to finalize a deal may extend into next year, as Beijing presses for more extensive tariff rollbacks, and as the Trump administration counters with heightened demands of its own.  New U.S. tariffs on $156 billion in Chinese goods are set to go into effect on Dec. 15, including on holiday gift items.  Failure to cut a deal could force the Federal Reserve to reconsider its stance on pausing interest rate cuts, analysts said.  “The latest trade headlines added to the negativity,” said Gennadiy Golderg, senior rates strategist, at TD Securities in New York. “If there is no trade deal, the market could price in higher odds of a rate cut next year.”  U.S. 10-year and 30-year yields have fallen in six of the last seven sessions, while two-year yields dropped to two-week lows.  Amid persistent trade tension, the U.S. yield curve continued to flatten on Wednesday, with the spread between the two-year and 10-year note yields hitting 15 basis points , the narrowest in three weeks. The yield spread has contracted for six straight sessions.  U.S. yields also took a hit overnight after the U.S. Senate on Tuesday unanimously passed legislation aimed at protecting human rights in Hong Kong. China, in reaction, vowed to undertake strong counter-measures.  In afternoon trading, U.S. 10-year note yields fell to a three-week low at 1.728%. They were last down at 1.734%, from 1.786% late on Tuesday.  Tom di Galoma, managing director at Seaport Global Securities in New York noted that “the market is overextended right now,” having had a big move from 1.90% in 10-year notes to 1.72%. He believes Treasury yields could go higher into year-end.  Yields on 30-year bonds also slid to three-week troughs of 2.192%, last changing hands at 2.202%, down from 2.256% Monday.  On the short-end of the curve, U.S. two-year yields slid to two-week lows of 1.565%. They were last at 1.569%, down from Tuesday’s 1.596%. 	Reuters

The legal professional had invited the man, a 21-year-old protester, to stay after he quit his job to devote more time to anti-government demonstrations in Hong Kong and then didn’t have enough money to pay rent.      “There are people living in the same city who are in need and we can offer,” Mak told her 6-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son when they first asked about the stranger living in their home.      “I’d been thinking about what I can contribute,” said Mak, who asked to be identified by her surname. “I was aware of youngsters in the movement not having enough money or shelter or a place to take a rest. This is the minimum we can do.”      Mak is one of thousands of Hong Kongers who support activists away from the front lines. They might be scared to participate themselves in largely unsanctioned, and increasingly violent protests, but they want to do their part for the movement. The protests erupted in early June over a bill that would have allowed extraditions from Hong Kong to mainland China and that has since been scrapped.  Reuters spoke to more than a dozen of them, all of whom wished to remain anonymous or share only snippets of personal details, wary of scrutiny by police who have arrested more than 5,000 protesters in more than five months of unrest.     In this distinctly Hong Kong take on the sharing economy, one driven by altruism rather than profit, the support they offer ranges from shelter to car rides after rallies that often block roads and force railway stations to close – acting, in the process, as free twists on Airbnb and Uber.       Their stories reveal the breadth of support for the movement, the toll the protests have taken on families and the community spirit kindled in the chaos.    In a city with some of the most expensive property per square foot in the world, many Hong Kongers, like Katrina, live in tiny, crowded apartments.        But the 34-year-old church worker, who shares a dining-cum-kitchen-cum-living room, a bedroom and a small office with her husband and tabby cat, has opened her doors to seven protesters since July.       “It’s not a great environment, but if they really need shelter, it’s better than out on the streets,” said Katrina, holding out a blue sheet she uses to partition her living room when multiple protesters stay. To make more room, she threw out six dining chairs and on one particularly fraught night played host to four demonstrators, she said.      Katrina and Mak are among nearly 90 people offering their homes to young protesters on one Facebook group, and there are at least two dozen more groups with thousands of members on the messaging app Telegram offering legal assistance, mass-transit travel cards, food vouchers and protective gear to protesters.      There is no definitive measure of how many Hong Kongers support the protest movement, which has morphed into opposition to perceived Chinese meddling with freedoms promised to the former British colony. China denies such meddling.     But more than 80% of respondents to a telephone poll of 750 people by the Chinese University of Hong Kong last month said they supported the protesters’ demand for universal suffrage, up from 74% the previous month.       A separate October poll showed that the city’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, had the lowest popularity rating of any post-colonial Hong Kong leader.       Lam has acknowledged widespread discontent with her government but condemned escalating violence that in recent days has seen protesters locked in battle with police at a besieged university. Scores have been injured in the latest exchanges, amid barrages of tear gas, water cannons and petrol bombs.       Katrina says she objects to violence but doesn’t ask her lodgers what they do at protests.      She said the bigger question for the government is why protesters feel they must resort to violence.     “Carrie Lam says she is a mum and she treats Hong Kong youth as her kids. But you know why children do attention-seeking actions?” she said of Lam, who had no comment on how she was characterized. “Because you ignore them.”   Just under 60% of respondents to a Chinese University of Hong Kong poll last month said violent tactics are justified when the government fails to respond to large, peaceful protests. Recent escalations – in which people have been beaten, knifed and even set on fire during protests – could affect this support but, for now, do not appear to have affected offers to help activists in online groups.  “Because they actually support the demands and they are angry about the government’s responsiveness, it is hard for the public to condemn the protesters’ violence,” said Francis Lee, a journalism professor who conducted the poll.        Sun remembers the night her mother kicked her out after learning she had been at a protest earlier that day.    “I left without anything, not even my shoes,” said Sun, one of many young protesters who have left or been barred from their homes after disputes with their parents over their participation in the movement.      “I felt hopeless. I didn’t know what to do, except I knew I still needed to go to protests,” she said.       Months of protest have driven deep divisions in some families, with parents warning their children against taking part in the demonstrations, fearful that they will be arrested or ruin career prospects.       Many young protesters say they now dread dinnertime, a cornerstone of family life in Hong Kong, because it usually degenerates into arguments over the demonstrations.      Stress and trauma over the turmoil have created a mental health problem that medical and welfare services are not equipped to deal with. Several suicides have been linked to the protests, and this summer Lam pointed to “fundamental deep-seated problems in Hong Kong society.”       Nam, a 45-year-old worker at a teen outreach nonprofit, is in regular contact with more than 200 young, mainly working-class protesters whose parents have locked them out of their homes, cut allowances or refused to pay school fees.       To raise awareness, Nam started sharing their stories on Facebook posts that quickly went viral. She said she has since received more than 10,000 messages from people wishing to help.      “Some of the kids think it’s all coming from me, but I say there’s a lot of people behind me. They break into tears,” Nam said. “It’s not just about the basic needs, but it’s also about the love and care from a stranger.”          Cheung, 27, works in a hostel in the Kowloon shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui – an area repeatedly hit by protests.    The owner told staff to allow protesters to stay for free or store gear such as helmets, masks and shields to avoid detection from police, Cheung said.     “I thought Hong Kongers were self-interested,” she said. “Now I can see that we’re motivated by public interest. There’s no me or you. It’s for everyone.”       Getting activists safely home from protest sites is the aim of many online chat groups that coordinate drivers from across class lines to ferry protesters in sleek luxury cars and rusty sedans alike.       One such group, which they call Uber Ambulance and isn’t connected to the company, has more than 32,000 members and uses code in its requests: Protesters are commonly referred to as students, protests as school, cars as school buses, drivers as parents and protest gear as stationery.      One post seeks “parents who can pick up students after school,” for example.         Eric, 34, a chauffeur by day who drives protesters after work, told Reuters he feared going to the front lines but wanted to help.       One evening, three teenage boys he was driving from a downtown protest to the New Territories area of Hong Kong started talking excitedly about girls, he recalled.       But the banter stopped abruptly when they received a message that some of their peers had been arrested.      “They’re evacuating from the protests, the police are at their back, but they have time to talk about girls,” Eric said. “Of course, they’re teenagers.      “Frankly, I’m very worried about the future. But the one thing that’s for sure is that I will drive at every protest.”  	Reuters
183	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N2800M3	November 20, 2019 /  5:52 PM / in 4 months	'Phase One' U.S.-China trade deal may not be completed this year -trade sources	WASHINGTON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Completion of a “phase one” U.S.-China trade deal could slide into next year, trade experts and people close to the White House say, as Beijing presses for more extensive tariff rollbacks, and the Trump administration counters with heightened demands of its own.  U.S. president Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an Oct. 11 news conference here that an initial  trade deal could take as long as five weeks to ink.  Just over five weeks later, a deal is still elusive, and negotiations may be getting more complicated, trade experts and people briefed on the talks told Reuters.  Trump and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer recognize that rolling back tariffs for a deal that fails to address core intellectual property and technology transfer issues will not be seen as a good deal for the U.S., a person briefed on the matter said.  Officials from Beijing had suggested earlier that Chinese president Xi Jinping and Trump might sign a deal in early December. Some experts say the next date to watch is Dec. 15, when tariffs on some $156 billion in Chinese goods are set to take effect, including holiday gift items like electronics and Christmas decorations.  “If talks are really going well, that hike will be suspended,” said Christian Whiton, a senior fellow for strategy and trade at the Center for the National Interest, and a former Trump and George W. Bush administration adviser. “If not, the U.S. will implement them and that will throw the game into next year.”  The crackdown on Hong Kong protesters may also complicate the deal’s completion.  The U.S. Senate passed a bill on Tuesday night condemning the crackdown and pledging support for Hong Kong, which was immediately criticized by Beijing.  “The violent crackdown against protesters in Hong Kong, which Beijing is directing, decreases the odds of a deal,” Whiton said. “Is Xi really going to be invited for a grip-and-grin with the president as his cops are beating students in Hong Kong?”  Negotiations also are complicated by conflicts within the White House about the best approach to China, and by the fact that Trump could veto any agreed deal at the last minute.  “China is going to have to make a deal that I like,” Trump said on Tuesday at a cabinet meeting. “If we don’t make a deal with China, I’ll just raise the tariffs even higher,” he said.  The flare-up in tensions between Washington and Beijing helped knock global stock markets from 22-month highs reached in recent weeks when some sort of resolution on the trade war appeared likely.  To be sure, some China and trade experts briefed on the talks told Reuters they were still optimistic a deal might come together in the coming weeks, and Trump said on Wednesday his team continues to talk with China.  A Saturday call between Mnuchin, Lighthizer and China’s Vice Premier Liu He was described as “constructive” by Chinese state media Xinhua.  And the U.S. government has begun issuing licenses for some companies to supply goods to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd , the world’s largest telecoms equipment maker whose blacklisting by the administration has been another point of contention.  Nonetheless, Chinese media pundits now also say they are pessimistic about a deal.  “Few Chinese believe that China and the US can reach a deal soon,” Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-backed Chinese tabloid Global Times, tweeted on Wednesday.  The Global Times is not the official media outlet of the Chinese Communist Party  - the People's Daily is - but Hu has described his role here as giving voice to what Beijing officials wish they could say in public.

The FTSE 100 lost 0.8% on its worst day in almost three weeks, as trade concerns weighed on Asia-exposed financial stocks like HSBC, while oil majors Shell and BP and industrial stocks also slipped.  Losses on the more domestically-focussed FTSE 250 were slightly more contained, as the index gave up 0.3%.  However, earnings-driven gains helped pub operator Mitchells & Butlers, software company Micro Focus and thermal processing service provider Bodycote rise between 4%-5% and outperform the mid-cap index.  Worries over U.S.-China trade escalated as President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on imports if no deal was reached, while nerves were jangled further after the U.S. Senate passed legislation backing protesters in Hong Kong, which drew condemnation from Beijing.  That spurred a broad sell-off across global markets as investors chose to prioritise safer bets over risky assets like stocks. They will also keep an eye on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest minutes, though no surprises are expected.  “Given that the U.S. Senate has just passed legislation in support of the Hong Kong protests, such a move threatens to drive a wedge into ongoing negotiations while potentially raising the barrier to a trade deal,” FXTM analyst Han Tan said.  Shares in Aviva Plc fell 3.5% as investors were underwhelmed by a strategy update from the insurer, which analysts say is struggling for direction since replacing its top boss.  Domestic stocks, which have benefited from polls indicating a likely Conservative victory in the upcoming election, weakened after three sessions, but still outperformed the broader European benchmark.  Markets are viewing a prospective Tory victory as a positive on hopes that Prime Minister Boris Johnson, with a majority in parliament, will be able to reduce uncertainty by delivering Brexit by the Jan. 31 deadline.  With less than a month to go before the ballot, Johnson on Tuesday doubled down on his Brexit promise in a debate with his main rival, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. 	Reuters

Recent escalations – in which people have been beaten, knifed and even set on fire during protests – could affect this support but, for now, do not appear to have affected offers to help activists in online groups.  “Because they actually support the demands and they are angry about the government’s responsiveness, it is hard for the public to condemn the protesters’ violence,” said Francis Lee, a journalism professor who conducted the poll.        Sun remembers the night her mother kicked her out after learning she had been at a protest earlier that day.    “I left without anything, not even my shoes,” said Sun, one of many young protesters who have left or been barred from their homes after disputes with their parents over their participation in the movement.      “I felt hopeless. I didn’t know what to do, except I knew I still needed to go to protests,” she said.       Months of protest have driven deep divisions in some families, with parents warning their children against taking part in the demonstrations, fearful that they will be arrested or ruin career prospects.       Many young protesters say they now dread dinnertime, a cornerstone of family life in Hong Kong, because it usually degenerates into arguments over the demonstrations.      Stress and trauma over the turmoil have created a mental health problem that medical and welfare services are not equipped to deal with. Several suicides have been linked to the protests, and this summer Lam pointed to “fundamental deep-seated problems in Hong Kong society.”       Nam, a 45-year-old worker at a teen outreach nonprofit, is in regular contact with more than 200 young, mainly working-class protesters whose parents have locked them out of their homes, cut allowances or refused to pay school fees.       To raise awareness, Nam started sharing their stories on Facebook posts that quickly went viral. She said she has since received more than 10,000 messages from people wishing to help.      “Some of the kids think it’s all coming from me, but I say there’s a lot of people behind me. They break into tears,” Nam said. “It’s not just about the basic needs, but it’s also about the love and care from a stranger.”          Cheung, 27, works in a hostel in the Kowloon shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui – an area repeatedly hit by protests.    The owner told staff to allow protesters to stay for free or store gear such as helmets, masks and shields to avoid detection from police, Cheung said.     “I thought Hong Kongers were self-interested,” she said. “Now I can see that we’re motivated by public interest. There’s no me or you. It’s for everyone.”       Getting activists safely home from protest sites is the aim of many online chat groups that coordinate drivers from across class lines to ferry protesters in sleek luxury cars and rusty sedans alike.       One such group, which they call Uber Ambulance and isn’t connected to the company, has more than 32,000 members and uses code in its requests: Protesters are commonly referred to as students, protests as school, cars as school buses, drivers as parents and protest gear as stationery.      One post seeks “parents who can pick up students after school,” for example.         Eric, 34, a chauffeur by day who drives protesters after work, told Reuters he feared going to the front lines but wanted to help.       One evening, three teenage boys he was driving from a downtown protest to the New Territories area of Hong Kong started talking excitedly about girls, he recalled.       But the banter stopped abruptly when they received a message that some of their peers had been arrested.      “They’re evacuating from the protests, the police are at their back, but they have time to talk about girls,” Eric said. “Of course, they’re teenagers.      “Frankly, I’m very worried about the future. But the one thing that’s for sure is that I will drive at every protest.”  	Reuters

How many took to the underground network of tunnels to flee and whether any actually got away is unclear.  But for those who tried, it was an experience they were unlikely to forget.  “I never thought that one day I would need to hide in a sewer or escape through sewers to survive,” student Bowie told Reuters.  “I’ve never thought I would live like that ... The most unforgettable feeling is the fear when I was inside.”  The 21-year-old said that she and others had tried various ways to flee the campus besieged by police, but none of them made it out.  “This time we truly think we need to fight, or we die, so we went into the sewer.”  Bowie was one of a few dozen people still trapped in the Hong Kong Polytechnic University this week.  After two days of some of the most intense clashes since anti-government protests began in the city 5 months ago, police have barricaded the streets around the campus and are waiting for activists to surrender. [L3N2800OG]  Fearing arrest on rioting charges that could bring years in prison, small groups of protesters waited for low tide before pulling up the gratings and heading down into the unknown.  At times they were brushing off cockroaches, even as they heard police cursing them and calling them cockroaches from the streets above.  Authorities, wise to the attempts, moved to thwart them.  Fire service divers sealed off the entrance to the sewers within the university, while others searched for anyone trapped, injured or dead.  A local police commander said on Wednesday night that they had arrested two men climbing out of a sewer in a nearby street. They also arrested three other men and a woman who had removed a manhole cover to help them surface.  Those trying to flee via sewers took torches, rope, first aid kits and water and tried to use weak phone signals to track their progress. Some groups also carried spray cans - marking the tunnels for other groups.  “The distance looks short above ground but time becomes slow downstairs,” said another tunneller, Sun, 22, a part time clerk.  Bowie described smelling the stench, seeing snakes in the tunnel and battling her fears about water levels rising with the tide.  She said that her group, worried about running into police when they emerged, spent an hour swimming before they found a spot to rest and take stock.  They decided to find the nearest exit, thinking they were already clear of the campus.  “When we reached the exit, we found we were still in Poly,” she said. “We were very disappointed.” 	Reuters

189	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1XU0J4	November 20, 2019 /  5:56 AM / 4 months ago	Breakingviews - Hadas: Hong Kong tips Beijing’s balance quandary	LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - It may all make sense to Xi Jinping. For the Chinese leader, dissent, as seen in the Hong Kong protests, leads to disorder. Disorder could damage economic growth, undermine the government and end in disaster. The 19th century Taiping rebellion, as an extreme example, killed about 5% of the Chinese population. Thus, Xi might reason, firm repression is the only way forward.  For the moment, Beijing’s dissent problems are limited to the country’s imperfectly integrated frontiers. In the southeast, many Hong Kong residents resent the gradual smothering of their separate political system. In the west, many Muslims in Xinjiang want a more religious culture.  The central government’s response has been unequivocal in both peripheral regions. Whatever the cause or the cost, the dissent must be crushed. In Xinjiang, the government has built a hyper-modern police state, where United Nations experts and activists estimate as many as 1 million Uighurs and other ethnic Muslims have been detained in camps and where a sophisticated artificial intelligence network keeps watch over the non-incarcerated.  Such systems are not cheap, but they are a bargain in comparison to the possible costs of subduing Hong Kong. There is already a retail recession and investments have declined. If there are further rounds of violence and repression, the price will rise. Foreigners and their capital will drift away, leading to a deep and lasting recession.  China can take the economic pain. Hong Kong provides only 3% of the country’s roughly $14 trillion gross domestic product, and the economy in the special administrative region there would shrink, not disappear. The nation’s financial sector would be dislocated, but only accelerate the already planned rise of Shanghai and Shenzhen, its less politically uncertain rivals.  Even so, the goal of the ruling Chinese Communist Party is not to make people poorer. Xi probably wants to avoid gratuitous violence. Four decades of turgid pronouncements show a simple vision: good policies from the central government produce a unified people, along with a prosperous, contented and loyal nation.  The prosperity is a work in progress, but overall the plan has worked well. There has been enough economic freedom to provide strong growth, and enough propaganda to minimise political discontent. The People’s Republic is an autocracy with Chinese characteristics.  As the Party expects of them, the Chinese masses are showing more acrimony than sympathy for the Hong Kong demonstrators. That uniform popular line is nothing new. The last big public division was in 1989. That uprising ended with a massacre of protesters in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, after which the ruling party purged their leading sympathisers.  Since then, the economy has thrived. Growth is slowing, but the International Monetary Fund expects real GDP to increase by 6% this year, enough to boost almost everyone’s standard of living. Also, the state continues to use its tremendous economic power in citizen-friendly ways, such as reducing pollution and building up a modern healthcare system. Even though the Chinese inequality is high, Xi probably does not need to worry about facing the sort of popular economic fury that threatens governments in Lebanon, Chile, Iran and Iraq.  The current problems in the periphery do not really threaten the economic accomplishments. The costs of repression may bring down the growth rate and foreigners may huff and puff, but the key sources of sustainable national growth – investment, education and skilled job creation – are not under serious threat.  Longer term, though, the prospects for Xi’s approach are more doubtful. The greatest risk is not the country’s excessive debts, which worry many financiers and investors. This strong government can always create enough money to wipe them out. A much bigger danger is the tendency of strong governments to self-destruct. Call it the autocratic dilemma.  Supreme leaders who demand adulation are always fearful, because they realise that no one is sincere in their praise. When faced with dissent, they tend to become arrogant, because they half-believe their own propaganda. They therefore over-control, overreach and overreact, magnifying the rebellious discontent they were trying to squelch.  Xi is at risk. The government’s exaggerated response to peaceful protests in Hong Kong and sporadic violence in Xinjiang has almost certainly amplified hostility in both places. There could be a downward spiral. Greater fears breed harsher repression, spawning stronger resistance and then more government determination. Eventually, popular ill will could increase faster than the party can scare it away.  Fear and arrogance could also eventually derail the economy. Xi is already increasing the CCP’s influence on the private sector. If he moves too far, the old rot of central planning could set in. Also, his wasteful Belt and Road Initiative to build trade routes across Asia may become a serious economic drag, as might an increasingly assertive approach to diplomacy and defence.  If things start to fall apart, many Hong Kong protesters would be gratified. They should not be hasty, though. Dictatorial governments can certainly be murderous. Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward was responsible for as many as 50 million deaths. The Taiping rebellion, though, is a reminder that disorder is also to be feared.

Many more anti-government protesters remained trapped inside the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and two prominent figures were allowed by police onto the campus late on Monday to mediate, a sign that there is a growing risk of bloodshed.  “The situation is getting more and more dangerous,” Jasper Tsang, a pro-Beijing politician who is the former head of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council, told Reuters soon after he arrived at the campus.  As he spoke, big explosions were heard and flames flared up at a distant part of the campus. In streets nearby, protesters rained down petrol bombs, burning parked cars and the front of a Standard Chartered Bank branch.  Polytechnic University in Hong Kong’s Kowloon district is at the center of a standoff in the past week that has seen the most intense violence in five months of anti-government demonstrations.   Some of the protesters who escaped on Monday lowered themselves several meters from a bridge they had occupied on the campus to a flyover below. They then sped off on the back of motorcycles that were already waiting or arrived quickly.  A number of them appeared subsequently to have been arrested, a Reuters witness said.  Other protesters, hurling petrol bombs, tried repeatedly to break into the campus but police fired tear gas and water cannon  to push them back.   The United States expressed concern about the situation but China’s ambassador to London accused Western countries of interfering.   The size of demonstrations has dwindled in recent weeks, but clashes have worsened since early last week, when police shot a protester, a man was set on fire and the city’s financial district was filled with tear gas in the middle of the workday.   The city’s hospital authority reported 116 injuries on Monday, including one female in serious condition.  Earlier on Monday, police prevented dozens of people breaking out of the university through police lines. Officers had been deployed “on the periphery” of the campus for a week, appealing to “rioters” to leave, police said.  Tsang said there could be bloodshed if the police enter the campus by force and meet strong resistance, adding: “This is something that we want to avoid.”   Tsang, who with legal scholar Eric Cheung was the first prominent mediator let onto the campus by police, said it was  priority to ensure children trapped inside get out first.  Early on Tuesday, about 20 students accompanied by Tsang left the campus voluntarily, broadcaster RTHK reported on its livestream.   Witnesses estimated there were more than 300 people still on the campus as of late Monday.   Demonstrators are angry at what they see as Chinese meddling in Hong Kong’s promised freedoms when the then British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. They say they are responding to excessive use of force by police.  China says it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula granting Hong Kong autonomy. The city’s police deny accusations of brutality and say they show restraint.  The unrest poses the gravest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.   In Washington, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters the United States was “gravely concerned” about the unrest and violence and said the Hong Kong government bore primary responsibility for ensuring a return to calm.  “Unrest and violence cannot be resolved by law enforcement efforts alone,” he said, calling for an independent investigation into protest-related incidents and for the ruling Chinese Communist Party to honor promises of freedom and liberties for the Hong Kong people.  Earlier on Monday, China’s ambassador to London accused foreign countries including the United States and Britain of interfering in Chinese internal affairs through their reactions.  “Some Western countries have publicly supported extreme violent offenders,” Ambassador Liu Xiaoming told a news  conference at which he criticized Western reporting on Hong Kong as “misleading” and not giving enough prominence to violence perpetrated by the protesters.

Several protesters took up positions on the rooftops of Hong Kong Polytechnic University, armed with bows and arrows, as unrest spread across the territory’s central Kowloon district.  Police said a media liaison officer was treated in hospital after being hit by an arrow in the leg and another officer’s visor was struck by a metal ball although he was not hurt.  Protesters, who were sprayed with the blue liquid from water cannon, stripped off and hosed each other down to wash it off.  Police fired tear gas to try to break up protests on Nathan Road, a major thoroughfare in Kowloon’s Mong Kok district, which was strewn with loose bricks, and in Yau Ma Tei district, where successive volleys of gas canisters temporarily cleared the streets. Clashes intensified during the night.  “Rioters continue to launch hard objects and petrol bombs with large catapults at police officers,” police said in a statement. “Police warn that the violent activities in the Hong Kong Polytechnic University have escalated to rioting.”  Chinese soldiers in a base close to the university were seen monitoring developments with binoculars, some dressed in riot gear with canisters on their chests, Reuters witnesses reported.  Chinese troops in shorts and T-shirts, some carrying red plastic buckets or brooms, had emerged from their barracks on Saturday in a rare public appearance to help clean up debris.  The presence of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers on the streets, even to clean up, risks stoking controversy about Hong Kong’s status as an autonomous area.  Protesters are angry at perceived Communist Party meddling in the territory, whose freedoms were guaranteed when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Beijing denies interfering and has blamed foreign influences for the unrest.  Huge fires had lit up the sky at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University on Saturday night and into Sunday morning after protesters threw petrol bombs. In the university courtyard, Joris, 23, said students fired arrows to protect themselves.  “The protesters have been reacting to the police. We haven’t fought back as much as we could. I would be prepared for jail. We are fighting for Hong Kong,” the civil engineer told Reuters.  The campus is the last of five universities to be occupied by activists, who have used the site as a base to block the Cross Harbour tunnel, which connects Kowloon to Hong Kong island.  A police truck, deployed to clear the bridge above the tunnel, retreated in reverse after being set ablaze.  “We are not afraid,” said third-year student Ah Long, who did not give his full name. “If we don’t persist, we will fail.”  The violence has posed the gravest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. Xi has said he is confident Hong Kong’s government can resolve the crisis.  Chinese troops have appeared on Hong Kong’s streets only once since 1997, to help clear up after a typhoon last year.

Activists closed the Tolo highway this week, clashing with police and throwing debris and petrol bombs on the road linking the largely rural New Territories with the Kowloon peninsula to the south.  They turned the Chinese University campus next door and several other universities into fortresses, stockpiled with petrol bombs and bows and arrows, amid some of the worst violence in the former British colony in decades.  But many protesters left the Chinese University after some allowed the partial reopening of the highway on Friday, taking others by surprise.  “I am disappointed about the decision to reopen the Tolo highway and it’s not our consensus,” one student who gave his name as Cheung, 18, told Reuters.  “I was asleep when they had closed-door meetings. I was worried and scared after I realized what had happened and most protesters had left. I was worried the police might storm in again because so few people are left. Some protesters from the outside have gone too far.”  Most protesters had left by late evening but the road remained closed.  The Cross-Harbour Tunnel, outside the barricaded Polytechnic University where protesters have practised firing bows and arrows and throwing petrol bombs in a half-empty swimming pool, remained shut.  Students and protesters have barricaded at least five campuses in the Chinese-ruled city. Police have kept their distance from the campuses for more than two days, saying both sides should cool off, but many observers are afraid of what will happen if and when they move in.  Activists also littered Nathan Road in the Kowloon district of Mong Kok, a frequent venue for protests, with bricks and set a street barricade on fire.  The week has seen a marked intensification of the violence.  A 70-year-old street cleaner died on Thursday after being hit on the head by one of several bricks police said had been thrown by “masked rioters”. On Monday, police blamed a “rioter” for dousing a man in petrol and setting him on fire. The victim is in critical condition.  On the same day, police shot a protester in the abdomen. He was in stable condition.  “We can no longer can say Hong Kong is a safe city,” Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung told a briefing.  Protesters are angry at perceived Chinese meddling in the city since it returned to Beijing rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula guaranteeing its colonial-era freedoms. Their demands include full democracy and an independent investigation into perceived police brutality.  China denies interfering and has blamed Western countries for stirring up trouble. Police say they are acting with restraint in the face of potentially deadly attacks.  China and Hong Kong both condemned an attack in London on Thursday by a “violent mob” on Hong Kong’s justice secretary, the first direct altercation between demonstrators and a government minister.   Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng, who was in London to promote Hong Kong as a “dispute resolution and deal-making hub”, was targeted by a group of protesters who shouted “murderer” and “shameful”.  The British police said a woman had been taken to hospital with an injury to her arm and that they were investigating but no arrests had been made.  Hong Kong sank into recession for the first time in a decade in the third quarter, government data confirmed on Friday, with its economy shrinking by 3.2% from the previous quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis.  Organizers of the annual Clockenflap music and arts festival, due to take place from Nov. 22-24, said it had been canceled because of the unrest.  Video footage obtained by Reuters of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army garrison headquarters near Hong Kong’s Central business district showed more than a dozen troops conducting what appeared to be anti-riot drills against people pretending to be protesters carrying black umbrellas.

The encounter at Hanyang University in Seoul led to a seven-hour confrontation, he said, with the Koreans trying to protect their hand-written poster bearing the message “We join the democracy movement in Hong Kong”, and the other side jeering, throwing things and chanting “One China”.  “They come in groups, cursing and saying they would kill us. They took photos of the students who support Hong Kong and shared them on social media,” Kim told Reuters.  Kim said the Chinese students mocked the South Koreans in the Wednesday altercation, suggesting they had been paid to back Hong Kong, and making that point by throwing coins at them.  Hong Kong has been rocked by five months of protests by big crowds, with young people at the forefront, angered by what they see as Beijing’s stifling of freedoms despite a “one country, two systems” promise of autonomy when the city returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  China rejects the suggestion it is interfering in Hong Kong, and blames Western countries for inciting the trouble.  South Korea has its own painful history of student-led, pro-democracy protests, in particular a l980 uprising crushed by troops.  “South Korea received support from foreign countries when we fought for democracy. I couldn’t remain silent as I also share the belief in the value of democracy,” said another student, Kang Min-seo, 24.  Reuters could not track down contact information for the Chinese students involved in the Wednesday confrontation, or in several similar incidents that have taken place at South Korean universities.  Hong Kong’s protests have stirred similar confrontations in various places around the world in recent weeks, usually involving patriotic Chinese students.  China’s embassy in South Korea said it regretted “emotional conflicts” between the students but it was “natural and sensible” for Chinese students to display anger towards efforts to hurt their country’s sovereignty and distort facts.  A coalition of students supporting the Hong Kong protests criticized the embassy, saying it facilitated the Chinese students’ attempts to undermine democracy, and called for a protest next week to raise awareness of the issue.  “I have a room-mate from mainland China and we don’t talk about politics because we’d argue,” said Huang Shun Yi, a Taiwanese student at Hanyang University.  “But for me, Hong Kong and Taiwan are like brothers, and I want to help.”  At Seoul National University, students have created their own “Lennon Walls” - mosaics of Post-it notes named after the John Lennon Wall in communist-controlled Prague in the 1980s - which have appeared in Hong Kong.  Most notes called for support for Hong Kong’s freedom but some were not so enthusiastic. “Hong Kong is part of China,” one read.  Kim Dong-yoon, 23, a student at Korea University said Hong Kong’s protesters needed international support.  “We young people might seem uninterested in politics but we have pride in the principles of democracy,” Kim said.

At City University, protesters used ping pong tables, potted plants, furniture, sports equipment, and bamboo to form a network of barricades to block roads and fortify the entrances to the student residence complex.  Hundreds of protesters wearing gas masks and helmets tore up piles of paving bricks and ceramic tiles to hurl at police, while others stockpiled dozens of petrol bombs, distributing them to their forward positions.  Small groups sat chatting as they fashioned garden hose and nails into spikes to puncture car tires.  The scene this week was repeated at nearly half a dozen campuses across Hong Kong, where demonstrators say they have been forced into taking a harder line by the government.  Until now, the anti-government protesters have used fast-moving, hit-and-run tactics to “be like water” and avoid arrest in clashes with police.  But now with protesters beginning to wield bows and arrows and occupying improvised breastworks, the tactics threaten to take the pro-democracy campaign to a new level of risk for all sides.  The protesters say their non-violent efforts have been met by brutal police tactics, and their weapons are needed to protect themselves.  Police have shot and wounded at least three protesters.  “It has never been a fair war zone,” said 23-year-old Josh, as he watched protesters practice shooting arrows at Baptist University (BU).  “We have nothing, only masks and the police have guns. We’re only trying to defend ourselves.”  Another protester said he had begun to throw bricks after seeing police attack demonstrators.  “We try every peaceful means but we fail,” said Chris, 19, a student from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.   “We would probably throw petrol bombs and bricks because we don’t want our friends to be injured,” he said, breaking into tears as he described police crackdowns.  “I’m willing to die for Hong Kong.”  The protesters seem increasingly intent on forcing a showdown, as small raiding parties vandalize shops and block roads, tunnels, and rail lines in widening areas around their campuses.  Authorities said protesters had turned the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) into a “weapons factory”, prompting a crackdown on Tuesday that left many people injured in fiery clashes.  Students accused police of turning the campus into a war zone and said they have no choice but to defend themselves.  Protesters have fortified parts of the campuses of Polytechnic University and University of Hong Kong (HKU), in addition to CUHK, BU, and City University.  Graphic: Escalating violence in Hong - here  For the first time, protesters have been arming themselves with bows and arrows looted from university sports offices. Police said flaming arrows, a signal flare, and even electric saws had been wielded against officers.  On Thursday, police said protesters dropped flower pots and fired several arrows at officers near Polytechnic University. There were no casualties.  Protesters could be jailed for two years for assaulting a police officer, while “wounding with intent” could mean life, police said.  The city education secretary chided university authorities over “riotous acts” on campuses. HKU President Xiang Zhang called on students not to provoke the police into entering the campus.  “If there are any who are planning to do anything with serious consequences, such as actions likely to injure people, I appeal to them NOT to,” he said.  Demonstrators are angry about what they see as police brutality and meddling by Beijing in the freedoms guaranteed under a “one country, two systems” formula introduced when the territory returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  China denies interfering and has blamed Western countries for stirring up trouble.  Police deny using excessive force but have unleashed unprecedented amounts of tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, and water cannons.  In a possible preview of tactics to come, police used an armored truck with officers firing less-than-lethal rounds to break up a barricade in the business district on Wednesday.  CUHK had become a “battlefield for criminals and rioters”, a police spokesman said.  “Where did all these petrol bombs and weapons come from?” spokesman Tse Chun-chung asked reporters. “We have strong suspicion that the school was used as a weapon factory.”   At City University, the dorm buildings echoed to the sound of protesters pulling up and heaping paving bricks to use as projectiles.  They knocked back cases of drinks then filled the bottles with a mixture of oil and petrol.  Protesters with less experience used plastic bottles to practice throwing.  At one point, the operation got more organized as supplies of food, water and medical equipment were carried in.   “There are a lot of petrol bombs,” said one 16-year-old school student who felt compelled to join the fray.   “It’s set to be a good show.”  A sense of purposeful anarchy reigned. Some protesters picked up litter, sorting it for recycling, while here and there a couple waded through the crowd, masked and in black, holding hands.  University officials were nowhere to be seen, except for the residence guards who sat at their desks as protesters appropriated everything in reach.  Occasionally, lookouts would sound the alarm, sparking a flurry of activity and shouts as black-clad figures crouched behind barricades, umbrellas and homemade shields at the ready.  Some anxious international students scurried past, suitcases in hand. Others took photos.  Volunteer medics set a up a first-aid station in a hall.  “I’m not afraid to get hurt, but I’m afraid of being arrested, because it means a loss of freedom,” said 19-year-old student named Thomas, as he strapped on plastic guards on his forearms and shins.   “And freedom is why I’m here.” 	Reuters

The lira lost 0.5% as U.S. President Donald Trump described his meeting with Erdogan as “wonderful,” but fell short of explaining how they would overcome such issues as Syria policy and Turkey’s purchase of Russian defence systems.  “The market is assessing the possibility that the U.S. may be inclined to impose sanctions on Turkey for a number of different issues, primarily the purchase of the Russian S-400 systems,” said Cristian Maggio, head of emerging market strategy at TD Securities.  A stronger Indian rupee and Philippine peso helped limit declines on a broader index of emerging market currencies.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell nearly 1% to a one-month low as protesters paralysed parts of the Asian financial hub for a fourth day, closing schools and blocking highways.  The index is on track for its biggest weekly decline in three-and-a-half months. It’s shed nearly 8% since the protests turned violent in June.  “The biggest risk here is that China at some point loses patience and decides to intervene (and) that would definitely precipitate an increase in friction with the U.S.,” Maggio said.  As trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies heightened this week, China said it was holding “in-depth” discussions with Washington and that cancelling tariffs was an important condition to reaching a deal.  Chinese stocks rebounded from six-month lows after a slowdown in industrial activity in October led to bets that the central bank would intervene again after cutting a key policy rate this month.  The Russian rouble gained against a weaker dollar for the first time in five sessions, as data showed Russia’s economic growth picked up in the third quarter.  The Philippine peso also strengthened for the first time in nearly two weeks after the central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged, as expected, following stronger-than-expected growth in the third quarter.

Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, which had planned to host the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) Assembly of Presidents, on Wednesday lowered its profit guidance for the second time in less than a month, citing the “challenging and uncertain” outlook in its home city.  “This was a very difficult decision, given our commitment to organize this important industry event, but reflects the unpredictability of the situation in Hong Kong,” AAPA and Cathay said of the cancellation in a joint statement to delegates.   “At the same time, the well-being of our delegates and guests has always been of paramount importance.”  Senior executives from major Asian airlines such as Japan Airlines, ANA Holdings Inc, Korean Air Lines Co Ltd, Vietnam Airlines JSC and manufacturers Airbus SE and Boeing Co had been expected to attend the event.  The cancellation came just over a week after major back to back conferences on air finance, a key growth area for Hong Kong. The Airfinance Journal and Airline Economics events went ahead smoothly, albeit with a marked drop in attendance compared to previous years.  Several aircraft finance executives at those events said there were concerns about the impact of Hong Kong protests, but some Western companies including U.S. lessor Air Lease Corp AL.N reaffirmed their presence in the city which is seen as a gateway to the fast-developing mainland Chinese market.

Wall Street was set to open weaker as well, equity futures showed, with the S&P 500 index indicated 0.4% lower.  The other issue weighing on sentiment is the intensifying unrest in Hong Kong which many fear will lead to a Chinese crackdown. That pushed Hong Kong shares 2% lower and weighed on markets across Asia.  MSCI’s index of world shares slipped 0.3%, following a 1% fall in Asian shares outside Japan. Japan’s Nikkei slipped almost 1%, moving further off last week’s 13-month highs.  “The market was anticipating something more positive from Trump, but he didn’t deliver,” said Justin Onuekwusi, a portfolio manager at Legal & General Investment Management.  “In recent weeks, we saw the balance of probabilities shift to the positive side, risks being taken off the table, but people have realised that risk is still there,” Onuekwusi said. He’s been reducing his equity allocations, he said.  Trump’s speech threatened to raise tariffs on China, but he also said a trade deal was “close”, without offering details on when or where it would be signed. He also criticised EU trade policies before a Nov. 14 deadline to decide whether to raise tariffs on European and Japanese carmakers.  That deadline will probably be extended, but investors remain jittery. A pan-European equity index fell 0.6, coming off Tuesday’s four-year highs, when optimism before Trump’s speech and better-than-expected economic indicators from Germany boosted stocks.  An index of European auto companies slipped 2%. Bank shares lost 2.7%.  Brent crude oil futures fell more than 1% as the diminishing prospects for a resolution to the 16-month long trade war suggested less future demand for energy.  Expectations for phase one of a trade deal this month have supported stocks and riskier assets recently. Investors were led to cut the share of cash in their portfolios to six-and-a-half-year lows, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s monthly survey of global managers.  The poll also showed growth optimism at 18-month highs.  However, lack of progress on an agreement has started to increase doubts about whether a trade truce will happen at all.  “I’m absolutely concerned. The clock is ticking,” said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney. “Markets are now expecting substantial progress in the next week or so, and if not, then confidence could crumble.”  Equity futures suggest a weak session for U.S. stocks, where the S&P 500 backed off record highs after Trump spoke. Nasdaq and Dow Jones futures were also down 0.5%  The S&P 500 has risen 2% this month and 23% so far in 2019 thanks to interest rate cuts, trade hopes and robust corporate earnings — profits at three-quarters of S&P 500 companies have topped expectations this quarter, according to Refinitiv.  But a more prolonged standoff will revive fears for the world economy. Oxford Economics estimates the trade war has trimmed eight-tenths of a percentage point off U.S. growth. Having started 2019 with 3.1% growth, the economy eased to 1.9% in the third quarter, they noted.  Asian markets were also rattled by Trump’s speech and Hong Kong’s turmoil. Onshore spot yuan fell to a low of 7.0270 per dollar at one point, the weakest since Nov. 5.  Hong Kong protesters planned to paralyse parts of the city for a third day, with transport, schools and many businesses closing after violence escalated across the city.  Hong Kong interbank rates rose, with one-month HIBOR at its highest since Aug. 6.  The standout currency performer was the New Zealand dollar m which jumped 1% after the central bank unexpectedly left interest rates unchanged at 1%.  The U.S. dollar gained 0.05% against a currency basket, just off three-week highs. The damage to risk appetite pushed down yields on U.S. and German safe-haven debt. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes fell to a six-day low around 1.87%; 10-year Bund yields were down 4 basis points to minus 0.28%.

MSCI’s index of emerging market shares shed 0.9% to their lowest level in nearly two weeks. The index is on track for its first weekly decline in six as investors grow wary that a U.S.-China trade pact will indeed be signed.  Addressing the Economic Club of New York on Tuesday, Trump said a deal with China was “close”, but gave no new details on when or where an agreement would be signed.  “The market really needs to see a date and a location for the meeting,” said Chris Turner, head of EMEA and LATAM research at ING.  “The jury’s out right now and it feels like the market’s prepared to give the progress the benefit of the doubt in a way and still price in that a ‘phase one’ deal is still concluded by the end of the year.”  Chinese blue-chip stocks fell slightly, while the yuan eased to a one-week low against the dollar as Trump also said he would raise tariffs on Chinese goods if the two sides failed to reach a deal.  Hong Kong shares dropped 1.8% to a one-month low as protesters paralysed parts of the Asian financial hub for a third day, with transport, schools and many businesses closing after violence spread across the city.  In eastern Europe, focus turned to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s meeting with Trump, after which they are scheduled to hold a joint news conference.  Turkey stocks were among the few bright spots of the day, rising 0.2%, while the lira firmed against the dollar.  But other currencies in the developing world, including the South African rand and the Russian rouble, lost ground against the dollar, which held near one-month highs.  In Russia, all eyes will be on the third-quarter preliminary GDP figures due later in the day, with analysts expecting the economy to expand by 1.6%, according to Refinitiv data.

The airline said passenger numbers fell 7% in October and it now expected second-half profit to be “significantly below” the first half’s HK$1.347 billion ($172.04 million), in a step up from the wording “below” used last month.  Hong Kong anti-government protesters on Wednesday paralyzed parts of the Asian financial hub for a third consecutive day, with some transport links, schools and many businesses closing after an escalation of violence.  “Overall we foresee a challenging remainder of 2019 for our airlines,” Cathay Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam said in a statement on Wednesday.  “Looking ahead, our advanced bookings continue to show weakness in both inbound and outbound Hong Kong traffic for the rest of 2019, partly offset by moderately increased transit passengers via Hong Kong.”  Cathay reduced passenger flight capacity by 2-4% versus its original schedule between August and October and made further cuts of 6-7% for November and December, Lam said.   The percentage of seats filled dropped by 4 percentage points to 77.6% in October despite the capacity cuts, airfares were under pressure and premium travel demand was sluggish, he said.  The airline is expected to hold an analyst briefing on Thursday, the first under a new management team led by Chief Executive Augustus Tang after the airline’s former head, Rupert Hogg, resigned in August after a crackdown by China’s aviation regulator.  Some analysts have already forecast the carrier will report a loss in the second half. 	Reuters

Chaos in Hong Kong also undermined sentiment as the city prepared for more clashes, with some transport links, schools and businesses closing after an escalation of violence.  The Nikkei share average fell 0.85% to 23,319.87, having cooled since it hit an 13-month high of 23,591 on Friday. The broader Topix lost 0.55% to 1,700.33, ending a six-day winning streak.  Trump on Tuesday dangled the prospect of completing an initial trade deal with China “soon”, but at the same time warned he would raise tariffs on Chinese goods “very substantially” if China does not strike a deal..  “I guess it was his usual tactics but it wasn’t positive,” said Hideyuki Ishiguro, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities. “The market has been overheating so we need a period to cool down a bit too.”  Many market players have said a correction is inevitable after the Nikkei’s sharp rise of recent months - more than 17% up from its seven-month low marked in early August.  Among blue chips, Nissan Motor slid 0.5% after the carmaker cut its full-year forecast to an 11-year low and posted a 70% slump in quarterly profit. Since the arrest of the firm’s former chairman Carlos Ghosn almost a year ago, the company has lost about 30% of value.  Elsewhere, GMO Payment Gateway dropped 9.3% after the e-commerce settlement service company’s quarterly earnings and profit guidance for the year to next September fell short of market expectations.  Fujifilm, on the other hand, jumped 6.3% after the firm reported strong quarterly earnings and estimated it would make a record annual profit.  In other sectors, however, market sentiment remained fairly upbeat, with investors snapping up technology shares sensitive to the global economic outlook. Keyence rose 0.6% while Murata Manufacturing gained 0.7%.  Meanwhile, the index of the Jasdaq start-up market ticked up 0.17% to hit an 11-month high.  Real estate investment trusts (REITs) extended their recent losses, as residual hopes that a U.S.-China trade deal would ultimately be reached dented their allure as an alternative to low-yielding bonds.

After falling nearly 0.5% at one point, the pan-European STOXX 600 index  closed flat, helped by a turnaround in bank shares .SX7P and gains for sectors considered safer bets during times of economic uncertainty, such as food and beverage .SX3P and real estate .SX86P.  London's FTSE 100 .FTSE led declines among the major regional indexes with a 0.4% drop, while stocks in Frankfurt .GDAXI fell 0.2% and Paris .FCHI rose 0.1%.   The exporter-heavy FTSE index was hit by a jump in the pound after the Brexit Party said it would not contest previously Conservative held seats in Britain’s upcoming election, in a  boost for Prime Minister Boris Johnson.  Banks most exposed to Brexit news such as Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) and Barclays (BARC.L) jumped about 4%, countering losses in some Asian-facing banks such as HSBC (HSBA.L) and Standard Chartered (STAN.L), down nearly 2%, after  long-running Hong Kong protests turned violent.   Data earlier showed Britain’s economy grew at its slowest annual rate in nearly a decade in the third quarter, although the economy dodged outright recession.  “While the UK is being kept out of recession by surprisingly resilient consumer spending, the outlook for investment continues to look challenging as we move into 2020,” ING analysts said in a note.  “For now, we think the Bank of England will probably avoid cutting interest rates in the near term, although a lot depends on Brexit, and whether the jobs market deteriorates further.”  Ratings firm Moody’s warned on Friday it might cut its rating on Britain’s sovereign debt again, saying neither main political party was likely to tackle high borrowing.  The benchmark STOXX 600 rose to its highest in over four years last week on signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks, but investors are wary about a deal after U.S. President Donald Trump said he had not agreed to rollbacks of U.S. tariffs sought by China.  “With European equities now up over 10% from their August lows, there is a case to be made that equity markets may be due a pause,” Morgan Stanley’s Graham Secker wrote in a note.   “While it is perfectly normal for investor sentiment to turn more quickly than the actual data, we doubt that we are on the cusp of a meaningful rebound in corporate profits either here in Europe or the U.S.”  European miners .SXPP took the biggest hit, down 1.4% after data from top metals consumer China showed producer prices fell the most in over three years in October.

Officials from both countries said late last week that a rollback of some tit-for-tat tariffs had been agreed as part of a preliminary deal, that has still to be finalised, aimed at ending their trade war.  Even though that was subsequently denied by U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday, he did not completely rule out a deal and U.S. benchmark Treasuries held above a key support level at 1.9%, buoying the currency.  Moves were slight as traders kept a wary eye on further news on the U.S.-China trade war, and against the safe-haven Japanese yen the dollar fell as market participants reacted to the escalating political confrontations in Hong Kong.  “Market participants have become more cautious over the potential positive impact for global growth from a partial U.S.-China trade deal following comments from President Trump,” said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG.  “Nevertheless, market participants are likely to remain optimistic that the U.S. and China are moving closer to finalizing a partial trade deal by the end of this year,” Hardman said.  The euro traded at $1.1026, flat but not far from the Oct. 15 low of $1.10165 it fell to on Friday.  The Japanese currency was last up 0.3% at 108.93 against the dollar.  “The trade resolution is a little positive for the euro,” said Stephen Gallo, European head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets.  But China is unlikely to ramp up imports from the euro zone, Gallo said, which means the common currency is unlikely to benefit from the fact that the United States and China could decide to end the 16-month long trade war.  “Any bullish reaction in the euro will in our view be a second, third or fourth order response to a resolution of the trade war,” Gallo said.  He sees euro-dollar stuck between $1.10 and $1.12, he said.  The index which tracks the dollar against six major currencies was neutral at 98.317, flirting with a four-week high.  The Chinese yuan weakened 0.3% to 7 per dollar in offshore trade on fresh violence in Hong Kong, where police fired live rounds at protesters, with Cable TV and other media reporting at least one person being wounded.  Disappointing economic data also hurt sentiment toward the yuan, as China’s producer prices fell the most in more than three years in October, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed on Saturday, while the country’s consumer prices rose at their fastest pace in almost eight years.  The UK’s main stock index fell sharply on Monday as a violent day of protest in Hong Kong knocked Asia-exposed financial stocks. 	Reuters

Elsewhere, the British pound was up 0.1% at $1.2797 despite the fact that Moody’s warned on Friday it might cut its rating on Britain’s sovereign debt again, saying that neither of the main political parties in next month’s election was likely to tackle high borrowing levels which Brexit had made even harder to fix.

The Nikkei share average slipped 0.26% to 23,331.84, easing from a 13-month high hit on Friday, while the broader Topix ticked up 0.07% to 1,704.03, with advancers outnumbering decliners by a ratio of 62 to 38.  U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he had not agreed to a rollback of U.S. tariffs sought by China, raising some doubts on the chance of a deal, though he said on Saturday that trade talks were moving along “very nicely”.  Asian share markets were rattled by news fromn Hong Kong, where media reported at least one protester was wounded after police fired live rounds a day after officers used tear gas to break up demonstrations that are entering their sixth month.  “Given the market has rallied without any corrections, it needs some time for consolidation,” said Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex Securities.  “Japanese earnings results so far have not been great, with about 70% of companies cutting estimates. But investors are looking beyond the dips in the current year and to a likely recovery after that,” he said.  Honda Motor rose 3.9% as the carmaker announced a plan to buy back up to 1.9% of its own shares. That was more than enough for investors to offset any disappointment from the revision in its annual profit and global sales outlook to a four-year low.  Likewise, Nissan Chemical rose 9.9% after the company cut its earnings guidance but also announced share buybacks.  Regional lender Fukushima Bank, trading at about a quarter of its book value, rose 27.6% after public broadcaster NHK reported it would form a capital and strategic tie-up with Japanese internet brokerage giant SBI Holdings Inc.  SBI Holdings dipped 0.5%.  Sushiro Global Holdings jumped 6.8% to a record high after the sushi restaurant chain operator announced solid earnings and dividend hikes while security company Secom also gained 3.9% after brisk earning growth in July-September.  On the other hand, diaper maker Unicharm, which has had a high valuation, fell 7.7% as its earnings growth fell short of market expectations.  Bridgestone dipped 0.8% after the tyre maker cut its annual profit outlook. 	Reuters

Last weekend, anti-government protesters crowded into a shopping mall when a man slashed people with a knife and bit off part of the ear of a politician.  Several other gatherings are planned for elsewhere in the city, to protest against police behavior and perceived meddling by Beijing in the politics of the Asian financial hub.  China denies interfering in Hong Kong, but the protests have become the worst political crisis in the former British colony since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  Thousands of people gathered on Saturday night at a vigil for “martyrs”, after a student died in hospital this week following a high fall.  Though the vigil ended peacefully, many attendees called for revenge after the student’s death from injuries sustained during a protest.  Protesters have also called for a general strike on Monday and for people to block public transport, although when such calls have been made in the past they have come to nothing.  As they departed Saturday’s vigil, a number of people shouted “strike on Monday” and “see you on Monday”.

Thousands of people peacefully gathered in Tamar Park next to central government offices in the former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997, after they had secured rare permission from the police to hold the evening rally.  The protesters sang hymns and carried flowers, while many shouted “revenge,” a call heard increasingly often at rallies and given added impetus since a student died on Friday after falling from a multi-storey car park during a protest.  Police estimated 7,500 people attended Saturday’s vigil.   “Tonight we are not only here to mourn for him but to show the government, the Chinese Communist Party and the world that the things that have happened in the last six months have not been forgotten,” said Tom, 26, a government worker who asked that only his first name be used.  Chow Tsz-lok, 22, a student at Hong Kong’s University of Science and Technology (UST), fell on Monday as protesters were being dispersed by police.  Rallies have often erupted into clashes between police and protesters, creating the worst political crisis in the territory for decades, although Saturday’s vigil that drew students, older people and a few children was quiet in the early evening.  Police said they had fired one round of live ammunition on Friday as a warning to what they described as “a large group of rioters armed with offensive weapons” who threw bricks at officers trying to clear street barricades in the Kowloon area.  “The lives of the officers were under serious threat,” police said in the statement, released on Saturday.  Students and young people have been at the forefront of the hundreds of thousands who have taken to the streets to seek greater democracy, among other demands, and rally against perceived Chinese meddling in the Asian financial hub.  China denies interfering in Hong Kong and has blamed Western countries for stirring up trouble.  Under China’s “one country, two systems” formula, Hong Kong has retained freedoms from the colonial era not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.  Seven Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmakers had been detained or faced arrest as of Saturday and are due to appear in court on Monday on charges of obstructing a May meeting of the local assembly, according to police and several of the lawmakers.   “We believe that the government together with the police, as well as the pro-establishment camp, they are trying to escalate the anger of Hong Kong people in order to cancel or even to postpone the upcoming district council election,” Tanya Chan, a pro-democracy lawmaker, said at a press briefing, referring to upcoming elections on November 24.   One of the arrested lawmakers, Gary Fan, said the detentions were the result of “political prosecutions and judicial crackdowns” by Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam.  Protesters have called for a general strike on Monday and for people to block public transport, although when such calls have been made in the past they have come to nothing.  The death of the student is likely to fuel anger against the police, who protesters accuse of using excessive force.

Protesters have also called for a general strike on Monday and for people to block public transport, calls that have come to nothing in the past.

The maker of Cartier jewelry had been benefiting from its fast-growing jewelry business, but a slight slowdown in the division, weak watch sales and operating losses at online distributors Yoox Net-a-Porter and Watchfinder worried investors.  Watch sales have been under pressure, particularly in Richemont’s biggest market Hong Kong, where anti-government protests have scared off tourists and battered spending in the Chinese-ruled city.  “Hong Kong is very exposed to watches and jewelry, the market was down around 10% in the first quarter, then we had a severe drop in the second quarter,” Chief Financial Officer Burkhart Grund told investors during a call on the results.  He said the softness in jewelry was only temporary as big-ticket high jewelry items would be invoiced in the second half.  Hong Kong retail sales of jewelry, watches, clocks and valuable gifts dropped 47.1% in August and 40.8% in September, data showed last week.  Shares in the world’s second biggest luxury goods group, up almost 26% so far this year, were down 5.2% at 0828 GMT, dragging down peer Swatch Group (UHR.S) whose shares were 2.2% lower.  Richemont executives tried to reassure investors, saying that the adjustments of the group’s watch wholesale network and its new digital initiatives, including the launch of a joint venture with Chinese online giant Alibaba (BABA.N), needed investment, but were showing promising results.  Citi analyst Thomas Chauvet said he expected the group to emerge stronger from its current transformation, but was concerned about the persistent weakness in watches and losses at YNAP that were unlikely to be materially reduced in the next couple of years.  “Richemont is effectively loss-making on 30% of group revenues,” he said, maintaining a “Neutral” rating on the stock.  The executives declined to comment on whether Richemont was interested in U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co. (TIF.N), which LVMH (LVMH.PA) offered to buy for $14.5 billion.  Grund said the group wanted to focus on developing its own jewelry brands, including recently acquired Italian jeweler Buccellati that will join Cartier and Van Cleef in Richemont’s jewelry portfolio.   Sales rose 9% to 7.397 billion euros ($8.17 billion) in the first half of its 2019/20 fiscal year, but the rise was only 2% on a comparable basis, excluding online distributors.   Richemont said it had seen good progress in mainland China, Korea, Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom, making up for a double-digit decline in Hong Kong, echoing recent comments from peers LVMH and Hermes (HRMS.PA).  For a graphic on Swiss watch exports: tmsnrt.rs/2Jx4aNl  Richemont said its net profit was broadly stable at 869 million euros, excluding a 1.4 billion euro one-off gain in the year-ago period.

Watch sales have been under pressure, particularly in Richemont’s biggest market Hong Kong, where anti-government protests have scared off tourists and battered spending in the Chinese-ruled city.  “Hong Kong is very exposed to watches and jewelry, the market was down around 10% in the first quarter, then we had a severe drop in the second quarter,” Chief Financial Officer Burkhart Grund told investors during a call on the results.  He said the softness in jewelry was only temporary as big-ticket high jewelry items would be invoiced in the second half.  Hong Kong retail sales of jewelry, watches, clocks and valuable gifts dropped 47.1% in August and 40.8% in September, data showed last week.  Shares in the world’s second biggest luxury goods group, up almost 26% so far this year, were down 5.2% at 0828 GMT, dragging down peer Swatch Group (UHR.S) whose shares were 2.2% lower.  Richemont executives tried to reassure investors, saying that the adjustments of the group’s watch wholesale network and its new digital initiatives, including the launch of a joint venture with Chinese online giant Alibaba (BABA.N), needed investment, but were showing promising results.  Citi analyst Thomas Chauvet said he expected the group to emerge stronger from its current transformation, but was concerned about the persistent weakness in watches and losses at YNAP that were unlikely to be materially reduced in the next couple of years.  “Richemont is effectively loss-making on 30% of group revenues,” he said, maintaining a “Neutral” rating on the stock.  The executives declined to comment on whether Richemont was interested in U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co. (TIF.N), which LVMH (LVMH.PA) offered to buy for $14.5 billion.  Grund said the group wanted to focus on developing its own jewelry brands, including recently acquired Italian jeweler Buccellati that will join Cartier and Van Cleef in Richemont’s jewelry portfolio.   Sales rose 9% to 7.397 billion euros ($8.17 billion) in the first half of its 2019/20 fiscal year, but the rise was only 2% on a comparable basis, excluding online distributors.   Richemont said it had seen good progress in mainland China, Korea, Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom, making up for a double-digit decline in Hong Kong, echoing recent comments from peers LVMH and Hermes (HRMS.PA).  For a graphic on Swiss watch exports: tmsnrt.rs/2Jx4aNl  Richemont said its net profit was broadly stable at 869 million euros, excluding a 1.4 billion euro one-off gain in the year-ago period.

At an import expo in China this week, the images of a pro bass fisherman, lumberjack, bull rider and NASCAR and off-road drivers were there - but the flag was not.  “Even though we’re proud to showcase we’re a U.S. company, there are some things we’ve just tried to ... tame it down a little bit,” said Greg Pauken, director of product development at the maker of portable generators and other motorised tools. “Why create any more conflict than you need to?”  U.S. companies are walking a tightrope at the Nov. 5-10 China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai, with the fate of a preliminary deal between China and the United States to defuse the trade war still up in the air.  Strong backing from Chinese leader Xi Jinping has imbued CIIE with political symbolism unmatched by any other trade show in China.  The U.S. government has made a point of skipping it in the two years it has existed. Several other countries have sent leaders or senior officials, and many are hosting lavish pavilions promoting their nation’s wares.  Nevertheless, more American companies have showed up this year - nearly 200 - than in CIIE’s inaugural year, propelled by enthusiasm about China’s vast market. In some cases, companies also want to support an event that the Chinese government considers highly significant.  Concern was not far from the surface about prospects for business if the trade war drags on and the world’s no. 2 economy continues slipping.  U.S. companies are not yet being stigmatised, according to Stephen Lien, president of the Aerospace Asia Pacific Division at Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), but such a thing was “certainly possible.”  “We get Chinese customers walking in and talking to us all day long,” he said. “They’re not going to Philips just because we’re an American company and Philips is a European company. There continues to be a lot of interest.”  Nearby, Twiggy Zhao, a representative at the WD-40 Co (WDFC.O) booth, said the California-based maker of lubricants was eager to gain traction in the China market but remained “a little bit worried” about trade war fallout.  “We quite want to separate politics and business. I mean, our product is very helpful and useful, so we want people to focus on products,” she said.  On top of trade uncertainty is the perception that political risks have risen, as highlighted by the troubles the National Basketball Association has faced since the Houston Rockets’ general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong’s protests last month.  For Impossible Foods, the developer of plant-based meat substitutes, the risks are outweighed by the prospect of tapping into a huge country reliant on a environment-straining livestock industry.  Founder and chief executive Pat Brown was taking advice on how to walk the line from his brother, a diplomat in China.  “We don’t intend to impose our own ideology on China or anything like that, but we are not going to be shy about talking about our values,” he said.  “We’re not here to tell China how to run its business,” he added. “We’re here to help solve a huge global problem and help China solve its own food security and reduce its environmental impact. We’re completely focused on that.”  Li Fang, president and general manager of Corning Inc’s (GLW.N) greater China operations, said his company’s success here had been aided by government support. Li said attending CIIE for the first time this year was, in part, a gesture of support for China.  The New York-based company has invested more than $7 billion in China - more than half of it since 2015 - and is doing “extremely well,” despite risks, Li said.

Singapore, which vies with Hong Kong as Asia’s pre-eminent financial center, tightly restricts public demonstrations and does not allow protests over political situations in other countries.  Hong Kong has been gripped by months of often violent protests against mainland China’s perceived growing influence over the semi-autonomous city.  Police questioned Alex Yeung, a Hong Kong resident, for allegedly organizing a “gathering” on Oct. 11 at the Kimoto Gastro Bar in the financial district, where guests were invited to share their views on unrest in Hong Kong.  The event later shifted to a public promenade overlooking the glitzy Marina Bay, the police said.  “Currently, Yeung’s passport has been impounded while he is assisting the Police with ongoing investigations. He is, however, neither arrested nor in Police custody, and is free to go about his activities within Singapore,” the statement said.  Nicholas Narayanan, Yeung’s lawyer, said his client couldn’t comment due to the ongoing police investigation.  “Our client is fully co-operating with the police at this time,” Narayanan said in a statement.  Singapore is closely watching the developments in Hong Kong to avoid suffering similar “deep social angst”, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last month.  Lee, who has criticized the Hong Kong protesters, said Singapore would be “finished” if it went through similar unrest. 	Reuters

The closely watched same-store sales figure fell by 4.7% in the period, signalling a small deterioration compared to a 4.5% drop in the first half of the year, the shoes and leather goods company said on Wednesday.   Overall sales fell to 678 million euros ($750.6 million) at current exchange rates, broadly in line with an average analyst estimate of 676 million, according to a Reuters poll.  Diego Della Valle, the group’s founder and top shareholder, said the “highly competitive context” meant it was important to accelerate investments to support top line growth.   “Assuming no further turbulence from the markets, we believe that we will soon be able to obtain the expected results,” he said in a statement.  However, investments are likely to dent profitability in the short term: CFO Emilio Macellari told a conference call with analysts that while he was confident of reaching market consensus on revenues, forecasts for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were “feasible but challenging”.  Like other luxury goods makers, Tod’s, best known for its trademark rubber-soled loafers, has been hit by the weeks of anti-government protests and unrest in the Hong Kong, adding to pressure from weakness in its home market.  In the first nine months, sales in Italy — the group’s main market — decreased by 10% due to the weakness of its wholesale business.  Greater China rose 0.7% at constant exchange rates as mainland China, which represents more than 60% of the region, “more than offset the sharp slowdown” recorded in Hong Kong, the company said.

The party said in a statement it would support its “special administrative region” of Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997, and not tolerate any “separatist behavior” either there or in neighboring Macau, an ex-Portuguese colony that was handed back to Chinese rule two years later.  Some protesters in Hong Kong, angry at perceived Chinese meddling in its freedoms, have called for independence in sometimes violent unrest, a red line for Beijing. China denies interference.  As the party statement was released by Xinhua news agency, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said she had held a short meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Shanghai.  “He expressed care and concern about Hong Kong, especially given the social disturbances that we have seen in the last five months and he expressed support for the various action taken by Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government,” she told reporters.  Referring to the foundation of the 1997 deal under which Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule, Lam said: “...In strict accordance with the principle of ‘one country, two systems’ (we will continue) upholding the rule of law and trying to put an end to the violence.”  The “one country, two systems” formula guarantees Hong Kong’s freedoms, including an independent judicial system, for 50 years.  Lam denied widely reported rumors that her government was considering an amnesty for protesters charged with offences, one of the demands of the protesters. “In simple terms, it will not happen,” she said.  After gatecrashing fancy-dress Halloween festivities on Oct. 31, hundreds of Hong Kong protesters marked Guy Fawkes Day on Tuesday in the Tsim Sha Tsui tourist district of Kowloon by wearing the white, smiling Guy Fawkes masks made popular by anti-establishment hackers, the film “V for Vendetta” and protesters globally.  Some protesters vandalized traffic lights and a restaurant perceived as being pro-Beijing, prompting police to move in with the water cannon, near the science museum, as they have done on many nights during five months of demonstrations. Some protesters were detained while others ran off.  Guy Fawkes Day, also called Bonfire Night, is celebrated with fireworks and bonfires every Nov. 5 in Britain. Effigies of “guys” are burnt, marking the night in 1605 when Fawkes was arrested for a “gunpowder plot” to blow up parliament.   “We are here to tell the government that we are not afraid of them and that they should be afraid of us,” masked protester Pete, 27, said in front of the huge, harborfront neon Christmas decorations.  Lam banned face masks last month, invoking colonial-era emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years, but protesters have largely ignored the ruling.  China’s Communist Party, in a lengthy statement about decisions reached at a key leadership meeting known as a plenum last week, said it would improve the national security system in Hong Kong, as well as in Macau, though it gave no details.  The party decided to “establish a robust legal system and enforcement mechanism to safeguard national security in the special administrative regions and support them to strengthen law enforcement”.  The party will “perfect” the appointment and dismissal mechanisms for the leaders and senior officials of the two territories, it added, reiterating comments from a Chinese parliament official last week. Again, no details were given.  It will also perfect the system under which the party has full jurisdictional power over Hong Kong, in accordance with the constitution, Xinhua said.  The demonstrations in Hong Kong began over a since-scrapped extradition bill and escalated in mid-June against China. Protesters have kept up their calls for universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, among other demands.  The protests, which pose the gravest challenge to Xi since he came to power in 2012, have received broad support.  The number of people who take part in the mostly weekend rallies has dwindled from the millions who participated in June, but violence and vandalism have escalated. Authorities have refused permits for many recent protests, making them illegal from the outset and activists liable to be arrested.  There have been many injuries in the protests, but no deaths. A 22-year-old student at a Hong Kong university who fell during protests at the weekend was in critical condition on Tuesday, hospital authorities said.  A man stabbed at least two people on Sunday and bit off part of a politician’s ear before being beaten by protesters. A 48-year-old suspect has been charged with wounding.  Lam expressed her sympathies for the wounded, singling out the 22-year-old student. 	Reuters
241	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1XF2GW	November 5, 2019 /  8:04 PM / 5 months ago	Effort in U.S. Congress to rein in China on Hong Kong protests faces obstacles	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A push in the U.S. Congress for legislation to support pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and pressure China to refrain from a violent crackdown faces an array of obstacles, raising questions about the prospect it will ever become law.   The fate of the legislation could depend in part on whether lawmakers who represent states with companies heavily invested in the Chinese market can overcome concerns about Beijing’s retaliation against U.S. businesses.  The outlook is further clouded by a cautious response on Hong Kong by the Trump administration at a crucial juncture for U.S.-China trade talks and uncertainty over whether congressional leaders will make the issue a priority on a crowded end-of-year agenda.   The House of Representatives unanimously passed Hong Kong human rights legislation in mid-October, including a bill that would place Hong Kong’s special treatment by the United States under tighter scrutiny, drawing accusations from Beijing that the lawmakers had “sinister intentions.”  A Senate committee approved a similar measure in September, but it has not been scheduled for a vote by the full body, which is required before legislation can be sent to President Donald Trump. The White House has yet to say whether he would sign or veto it.   Even as Hong Kong activists have set their hearts on stronger U.S. action, which they see as vital to a movement that has drawn millions to the streets, the issue remains largely up in the air in Washington.  The bill’s delay - against a backdrop of increasingly dangerous clashes between protesters and police - has been a source of frustration for lawmakers whose overwhelming support for the legislation cuts across party lines.   “Your guess is as good as mine as to why something that enjoys that broad, bipartisan support - and on an issue that’s acute and happening now - has not reached the floor of the U.S. Senate,” Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a leading China hawk and the bill’s chief co-sponsor, told Reuters.  Looming over the Hong Kong crisis is the bitter trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. Trump has said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping will soon sign a “Phase One” trade deal, his administration’s top priority with Beijing.  At an Oct. 11 meeting in the Oval Office, Trump told Chinese Vice Premier Liu He he would keep quiet on the Hong Kong protests as long as progress was being made on trade, according to two people briefed on the discussions.  The White House did not respond to a question on whether Trump made such a promise or if the administration was concerned the Hong Kong situation could complicate trade talks.  While Trump has since avoided publicly criticizing China over Hong Kong, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have spoken out against Beijing’s human rights record in Hong Kong and elsewhere, including its treatment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.   The legislation reflects an increasingly hard-line sentiment among some of Trump’s fellow Republicans and many Democrats over what they see as Beijing’s tightening grip on Hong Kong.  Protesters are campaigning against what they see as Chinese meddling with the freedoms promised under the “one country-two systems” formula when Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies doing so, and has blamed Western countries for stirring up trouble.   The U.S. bills would amend existing law to require annual certification from the State Department that Hong Kong remains sufficiently autonomous from Beijing to justify the unique treatment by Washington that has helped it to develop into a major financial center.  China has threatened unspecified countermeasures, prompting the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong to warn of “counterproductive consequences” of the legislation that could hurt U.S. businesses.  That has given rise to speculation that some senators, especially those in agricultural states or with major China-dependent businesses, would prefer a go-slow approach and might even work behind the scenes to block the legislation.  Mark Simon, a Hong Kong-based executive for Next Media, a media group funded by pro-democracy businessman Jimmy Lai, is  pessimistic about the Senate bill’s near-term prospects after a recent round of meetings with members of Congress in Washington.  Simon expressed concern that as many as nine senators might have objections to the bill – though none has said so publicly. “The U.S. Senate, by refusing to stand up for Hong Kong, is editing our political process in order to sell some grain, pork, and planes,” he told Reuters.  Rubio said he had not heard objections from fellow senators, but noted it could be “somehow wrapped up in the broader trade issues and fear that it could unravel that.”  Despite activists’ clamoring for U.S. action, some experts say it could be counterproductive.  Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the University of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies, said the legislation “would play into Beijing’s hands by claiming it as evidence of the existence of a ‘foreign black hand’ behind the protests in Hong Kong.”  Bills similar to the current legislation have been introduced and gone nowhere in the past three Congresses, but the protracted crisis in Hong Kong has helped the measures advance further than previously.  The White House did not respond to requests for comment. But a U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity said the administration was prepared to let the congressional process run its course.  It is unclear whether Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will set a vote on a bill during an already jammed schedule in the final weeks of the 2019 session, including the threat of a federal government shutdown and looming impeachment proceedings against Trump.  One way to get around those obstacles, congressional aides say, would be to attach the Hong Kong legislation to a broader Senate bill on defense or the budget.  	Reuters

Twelve police officers were also injured during the weekend clashes, with more than 300 people ranging from 14 to 54 years of age arrested between Friday and Sunday, police said.  Chinese state media called on Monday for a tougher line against the protesters, who vandalized the local offices of state-run Xinhua news agency and other buildings, saying the violence damaged the city’s rule of law.   More demonstrations are planned this week to keep up pressure for demands that include an independent inquiry into police behavior and universal suffrage.  “We really see that people are very heavy-hearted. They don’t know what is going to happen tonight or maybe the next weekend. And there is a lot of worry,” pro-democracy lawmaker Charles Mok told Reuters.  More than 100 demonstrators, some wearing now-banned face masks, returned on Monday evening to a shopping center where a man had knifed several people on Sunday and bitten off a part of a politician’s ear before being beaten by protesters.  Those who gathered on Monday shouted at security guards and riot police who also briefly entered the complex in the eastern suburb of Taikoo Shing.  Police said they arrested three men involved in Sunday’s incident, including the suspected 48-year old assailant.  Riot police had stormed several shopping malls to disperse protests near families shopping on Sunday, after the worst violence in weeks on Saturday, when police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and a water cannon at crowds of black-clad demonstrators across the Chinese-ruled financial hub.  The city’s Hospital Authority told Reuters one person was in  a critical condition, with two others serious, among a total of 30 injuries from Sunday alone.  Local media reported a life-threatening injury was sustained by a male student who fell from a height, but details of the incident remained unclear. The head of the boy’s university called on authorities to investigate the matter in a heated dialogue on campus with students on Monday evening.  While Hong Kong and its many businesses function normally during the week, many protests have sprung up spontaneously at weekends over the past five months.  Pro-democracy protesters are campaigning against what they see as Chinese meddling with the freedoms promised when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies doing so, and has blamed Western countries for stirring up trouble.  Protesters have circulated plans on social media to mark Guy Fawkes Day on Tuesday around Hong Kong by putting on the white, smiling Guy Fawkes masks made popular by anti-establishment hackers, the film “V for Vendetta” and protesters globally.  Hong Kong’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, banned face masks last month, invoking colonial-era emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years, but protesters have largely ignored the ruling.  The protests have divided Hong Kong and undermined its economy, with the police coming in for particular scrutiny.   Police canceled a planned press conference on Monday after several journalists from the public broadcaster and other local media turned up wearing helmets with signs that said “investigate police brutality” and “stop police lies”, and then refused to leave when asked by officials.  “We are not protesting...We are just using our clothes...to urge the police to change and stop the violence against the journalists,” said Ronson Chan of online news site The Stand News. Police said the journalists’ actions were “disrespectful” and “deprived the public of access to important information”.  Local media associations have condemned what they describe as a heavy-handed approach by the police toward journalists, while officers have said they are responding to an escalating cycle of violence in five months of protests.  Protesters smashed doors and windows and threw petrol bombs at Xinhua’s office on Saturday, and also set fire to metro stations and vandalized buildings, including an outlet of U.S. coffee chain Starbucks.  The city’s Foreign Correspondents’ Club expressed grave concern at the attack on Xinhua, stating that news organizations and journalists must be able to work in Hong Kong free from fear of attack and intimidation.  Mainland businesses, including banks or companies seen as supportive of China’s ruling Communist Party, have often been targeted by protesters.  Police said the protests have been a “man-made disaster” for the city with some 45 kilometers (28 miles) of roadside railings dismantled, and 145 rail stations vandalized.   “Rioters’ destructive acts serve no other purpose than to vent their anger at grievances real and imagined,” said Chief Superintendent Tse Chun-chung on Monday.    “Continuing this rampage is a lose-lose situation for Hong Kong. Everyone is a loser. Please don’t let violence take over our daily life. Everyone deserves freedom from fear.” 	Reuters
244	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1XB4IL	November 1, 2019 /  3:21 PM / 5 months ago	Exclusive: U.S. opens national security investigation into TikTok - sources	NEW YORK/BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government has launched a national security review of TikTok owner Beijing ByteDance Technology Co’s $1 billion acquisition of U.S. social media app Musical.ly, according to three people familiar with the matter.  While the $1 billion acquisition was completed two years ago, U.S. lawmakers have been calling in recent weeks for a national security probe into TikTok, concerned the Chinese company may be censoring politically sensitive content, and raising questions about how it stores personal data.  TikTok has been growing more popular among U.S. teenagers at a time of growing tensions between Washington and Beijing over trade and technology transfers. About 60% of TikTok’s 26.5 million monthly active users in the United States are between the ages of 16 and 24, the company said this year.  The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews deals by foreign acquirers for potential national security risks, has started to review the Musical.ly deal, the sources said. TikTok did not seek clearance from CFIUS when it acquired Musical.ly, they added, which gives the U.S. security panel scope to investigate it now.  CFIUS is in talks with TikTok about measures it could take to avoid divesting the Musical.ly assets it acquired, the sources said. Details of those talks, referred to by CFIUS as mitigation, could not be learned. The specific concerns that CFIUS has could also not be learned.  The sources requested anonymity because CFIUS reviews are confidential.  “While we cannot comment on ongoing regulatory processes, TikTok has made clear that we have no higher priority than earning the trust of users and regulators in the U.S. Part of that effort includes working with Congress and we are committed to doing so,” a TikTok spokesperson said. ByteDance did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  “By law, information filed with CFIUS may not be disclosed by CFIUS to the public,” said a spokeswoman for the U.S. Treasury Department, which chairs CFIUS. She added that Treasury “does not comment on information relating to specific CFIUS cases, including whether or not certain parties have filed notices for review.”  Last week, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Tom Cotton asked for a national security probe in a letter to Joseph Macguire, acting director of national intelligence.   They said they were concerned about the video-sharing platform’s collection of user data, and whether China censors content seen by U.S. users. They also suggested TikTok could be targeted by foreign influence campaigns.   On Friday, Schumer welcomed news of the probe in an emailed statement, calling it a “validation of our concern that apps like TikTok...may pose serious risks to millions of Americans and deserve greater scrutiny.”  TikTok allows users to create and share short videos with special effects. The company has said U.S. user data is stored in the United States, but the senators noted that ByteDance is governed by Chinese laws.  TikTok also says China does not have jurisdiction over content of the app, which does not operate in China and is not influenced by any foreign government.  Last month, Musical.ly founder Alex Zhu, who heads the TikTok team, started to report directly to ByteDance CEO Zhang Yiming, one of the sources said. He previously reported to Zhang Nan, the head of ByteDance’s Douyin, a Chinese short video app. It was not clear whether this move, which separates TikTok organizationally from ByteDance’s other holdings, was related to the company’s discussions with CFIUS over mitigation.  In October, U.S. senator Marco Rubio asked CFIUS to review ByteDance’s acquisition of Musical.ly. He cited questions about why TikTok had “only had a few videos of the Hong Kong protests that have been dominating international headlines for months.”  After the Reuters story of the CFIUS investigation appeared, Rubio tweeted: “Any platform owned by a company in China which collects massive amounts of data on Americans is a potential serious threat to our country.”  U.S. Senator Josh Hawley said in a tweet that TikTok should testify at a hearing scheduled next week about technology companies putting consumer data at risk in China.   Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose product competes with TikTok particularly for younger users, has also criticized the app over censorship concerns.  The United States has been increasingly scrutinizing app developers over the personal data they handle, especially if some of it involves U.S. military or intelligence personnel.  Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd said in May it would seek to sell its popular gay dating app Grindr after CFIUS approached it with national security concerns.  Last year, CFIUS forced China’s Ant Financial to scrap plans to buy MoneyGram International Inc over concerns about the safety of data that could identify U.S. citizens.  The panel also compelled Oceanwide Holdings and Genworth Financial Inc to work through a U.S. third party data administrator to ensure the Chinese company could not access the insurer’s  U.S. customers’ personal private data.  ByteDance is one of China’s fastest growing startups. It owns the country’s leading news aggregator, Jinri Toutiao, as well as TikTok, which has attracted celebrities like Ariana Grande and Katy Perry.  ByteDance counts Japanese technology giant SoftBank, venture firm Sequoia Capital and big private-equity firms such as KKR, General Atlantic and Hillhouse Capital Group as backers.  Analysts have called ByteDance a strong threat to other Chinese tech industry firms including social media and gaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd and search engine leader Baidu Inc. Globally, ByteDance’s apps have 1.5 billion monthly active users and 700 million daily active users, the company said in July.  The seven-year-old Chinese start-up posted a better-than-expected revenue for the first half of 2019 at over $7 billion, and was valued at $78 billion late last year, sources have told Reuters.

The review of TikTok, owned by Beijing ByteDance Technology Co, comes after U.S. lawmakers raised concerns about its collection of user data and whether China censors content seen by U.S. users.  Below are key facts about TikTok that competes with the likes of Snap Inc’s Snapchat and Facebook Inc’s Instagram and Lasso.   TikTok allows users to upload short videos with special effects, many of whom dance, jump and lip-sync to pop songs and music in the app. The app also offers easy-to-use editing tools, so users can simply edit the videos via their cellphones.  It is one of the world’s most popular apps with more than 1 billion downloads globally, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower, becoming the first Chinese-developed consumer app to achieve international scale.  The app currently ranks fourth behind Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat as the most used social app in the U.S. Google Play Store, according to researcher SimilarWeb.  The app has especially created a buzz among U.S. teenagers. Around 60% of its 26.5 million monthly active users there are aged between 16 and 24, the company said earlier this year.  TikTok’s success in the U.S. market can be largely attributed to its acquisition of the lip-synching app Musical.ly in 2017.   Its features and users were later added to TikTok platform, and the deal helped TikTok’s U.S. monthly active users increase by 30 million in the three months after the merger, according to app tracker Apptopia.  U.S. Senator Marco Rubio in early October asked a U.S. national security panel to review TikTok owner Beijing ByteDance Technology Co’s acquisition of Musical.ly, arguing that TikTok was being used by the Chinese government to censor politically sensitive content.  In a letter requesting the review, Rubio noted that despite Hong Kong protests dominating international headlines for months, “the app only had a few videos” of the protests.  Facebook’s Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg later weighed in, saying the app censored political protests  TikTok denies that China censors its content, saying it is “not influenced by any foreign government.”  In February, ByteDance agreed to pay a $5.7 million fine to the Federal Trade Commission in the United States over TikTok’s illegal collection of personal information from minors.  In India, a local court ordered the federal government to temporarily ban new downloads of TikTok in April, saying the app was encouraging pornography and could expose children to sexual predators.  TikTok is ByteDance’s most successful platform outside China.  The seven-year-old startup, which sources say was valued at $78 billion late last year, also owns Chinese news aggregator Jinri Toutiao, meaning “Today’s Headlines”, as well as a domestic version of TikTok, known as Douyin.  It launched an overseas version of Jinri Toutiao, called TopBuzz, in 2015. However a person close to the company says it  is now exploring a sale of that platform.  ByteDance booked revenue of 50-60 billion yuan ($7 billion to $8.4 billion) in a better-than-expected result for the first half of this year, Reuters reported in September citing people familiar with the matter.  TikTok, also popular in India, Britain, France, Australia and Canada, is in the early stages of making money, while Douyin generates advertising fees, one of the sources said. 	Reuters

Twelve police officers were also injured during the weekend clashes, with more than 300 people ranging from 14 to 54 years of age arrested between Friday and Sunday, police said.  Chinese state media called on Monday for a tougher line against the protesters, who vandalized the local offices of state-run Xinhua news agency and other buildings, saying the violence damaged the city’s rule of law.   More demonstrations are planned this week to keep up pressure for demands that include an independent inquiry into police behavior and universal suffrage.  “We really see that people are very heavy-hearted.

Earlier, police had also used tear gas in a downtown park where thousands of protesters - many angry at what they say has been a heavy-handed police response over five months of anti-government demonstrations - had gathered on a sunny afternoon.   Small groups of masked protesters then fled to the Central business district, through streets lined with banks and top-end jewelry and fashion stores, setting light to ramshackle street barricades and hurling petrol bombs as riot police and water cannon trucks closed in.   Protesters are angry at perceived Chinese meddling with Hong Kong’s freedoms, including its legal system, since the city returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies the charge.   Just as a crowd of largely peaceful demonstrators finished making origami paper cranes in Chater Garden, a cricket pitch in colonial days, activists began throwing petrol bombs on the streets outside, in front of the headquarters of HSBC and the Hong Kong base for the Bank of China.  Police again responded with tear gas on what was the 22nd straight weekend of protests.   Protesters later set fire to entrances of metro stations — often targeted as services close down to stop people gathering — and hauled two telephone booths out of the ground to erect one of many flaming barricades. Cat-and-mouse clashes continued into the night as protesters retreated to the Causeway Bay area and across the water to the northern Kowloon side.  Some shops and businesses were also vandalized including an outlet of American coffee chain Starbucks and the offices of China’s Xinhua news agency.   “The practice of the black rioters once again shows that ‘stopping the violence and restoring order’ is Hong Kong’s most important and urgent task at present,” a spokesperson for Xinhua said in a Facebook post, adding that its doors had been smashed and fire and paint bombs thrown into the lobby.   Hong Kong media associations also condemned the vandalism at Xinhua, one of the mainland’s key symbols of presence in Hong Kong, calling for a halt to violence and urging police to handle the matter seriously.   Starbucks (SBUX.O) is owned locally by Maxim’s Caterers and has been repeatedly targeted after the daughter of the Hong Kong company’s founder condemned the protesters at the United Nations human rights council in Geneva.  Some protesters gathered across the harbor in the hotel and shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui, at the tip of the Kowloon peninsula, with scores of passengers on the Star Ferry chanting “Hong Kong people resist”.   Police said a group of masked protesters in that area had blocked roads with barricades, hurled petrol bombs and were “recklessly damaging facilities” as they proceeded up the shopping artery of Nathan Road towards the gritty Mong Kok district. In one incident, faeces was thrown at officers, police said.  The early use of tear gas in Victoria Park was an attempt to nip in the bud a rally billed as an “emergency call” for autonomy for Hong Kong that was promised its freedoms when it returned to Chinese rule under a “one country, two systems” formula.  Activists, many wearing now-banned face masks, pulled up metal fencing and used a football goal to build barricades near the park, a traditional venue for rallies and vigils for decades, their actions masked by others holding umbrellas.  “Hong Kong people, resist,” they shouted. “Revolution of our time.”  Many sang the British and U.S. national anthems, waving multi-national flags and a few called for independence, a red line for Communist Party leaders in Beijing who have vowed to “crush the bones” of anyone pursuing such a move.  Activists have attacked police with petrol bombs, set street fires and trashed government buildings and businesses seen as pro-Beijing over recent weeks. One policeman was slashed in the neck with a knife last month.  Police have responded with tear gas, pepper spray, water cannon, rubber bullets and occasional live rounds. Several people have been wounded.  Saturday’s rally in the park was not given official police permission, as is required, but that has not stopped people gathering in the past. Face masks were banned under a revived colonial-era emergency law.  “It doesn’t make sense (for this assembly to be unauthorized),” said one protester, 55, who only gave her name as Lulu. “This is our human right ... The global support is very important. We are not only in Hong Kong. The whole world supports Hong Kong.”   Government data on Thursday confirmed that Hong Kong slid into recession in the third quarter for the first time since the global financial crisis of 2008.

Now, the slight IT worker, who wanted to be identified only by her first name, is learning to fight.  “I stopped dancing, I’m fighting now,” she said.  Once a week, Pino joins a self-defense class where instructors give lessons on how to fight police, evade arrest, and navigate the unrest on the streets of the Asian financial hub. Lessons sometimes incorporate videos of real protest clashes.  These classes are one of several that have sprung up in recent months, say protesters, pitched at demonstrators and others concerned about getting caught in the chaos.  The rallies have been marred by violence which flares mostly during weekends, with demonstrators throwing Molotov cocktails, destroying shops seen as pro-Beijing, vandalizing train stations and engaging in running battles with police.  “Not only the frontliners or the youngsters, we all need to learn these skills to protect ourselves,” said William Cheung, the organizer of one self-defense class held regularly at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.      On a recent morning outside the university’s library, around a dozen students fenced with foam sticks representing the black batons used by police, and practised shielding blows with their backpacks.  “The topic of today’s lesson is escaping,” said R., a 19-year-old participant who asked to be named only by his first initial for fear of retribution.  “It looks like the fight is not coming to an end soon, and I don’t know for how much longer it will last,” he said, explaining why he felt the classes were necessary.  Demonstrators have also been fearful of attacks from other groups, particularly after suspected triad members set upon activists and commuters at a train station in Yuen Long district in July.      “If you don’t protect yourselves well, then you don’t know whether you’ll be beaten to death, or something bad may happen like being injured and hospitalized,” said Cheung.  Police did not immediately respond to request for comment about this story.  Pino, who volunteers as a medic during protests and attends to those injured, said she has learned how to disarm an attacker.  It might be some time, though, before she goes back to dance classes.  “I think in this society, we need to fight, not dance,” she said. 	Reuters

In a rare public criticism of Hong Kong’s unique “one country, two systems”, Li said in a London speech this week that there were “some fundamental flaws at the very beginning of the implementation”.  The formula was enshrined during the handover from Britain to China in 1997, which permits Hong Kong wide ranging freedoms not available on the mainland such as an independent judiciary.  Hong Kong has been battered by more than five months of protests fueled by concerns Beijing is undermining those freedoms. China denies meddling and accuses foreign governments including the United States and Britain of stirring up trouble.  Li said on Friday that some headlines in “western media” had not reflected what he was trying to convey.   “Lots of people in China think I was nuts,” Li told reporters. “But when you have a headline ... and when that gets translated into pieces out of context, and reported out of context to start with, obviously people have issues.”  Li, who runs Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (0388.HK) (HKEX), did not name Reuters which reported his London speech and his comments about “fundamental flaws”.   “I simply said I’m a great believer in ‘one country, two systems’, the design of the system works perfectly but the implementation at the very beginning had certain flaws,” Li said.  “On the one hand, the central government really needs to have confidence that whatever is going to happen in Hong Kong, no one will challenge that Hong Kong is part of China and its sovereignty is supreme,” he said.  “On the other hand unless the Hong Kong people ultimately enjoy universal suffrage, they will always consider any efforts not to allow them that to affect “one country, two systems”.  Hong Kong protesters are demanding universal suffrage, an independent inquiry into claims of police brutality, amnesty for those charged, and that the government and police stop calling protesters “rioters”.  The financial hub slid into recession for the first time since the global financial crisis in the third quarter, according to preliminary government data on Thursday, weighed down by violent anti-government protests and the protracted U.S.-China trade war.

Li said on Friday that some headlines in “western media” had not reflected what he was trying to convey.  “Lots of people in China think I was nuts,” Li told reporters. “But when you have a headline ... and when that gets translated into pieces out of context, and reported out of context to start with, obviously people have issues.”  Li, who runs Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), did not name Reuters which reported his London speech and his comments about “fundamental flaws”.  “I simply said I’m a great believer in ‘one country, two systems’, the design of the system works perfectly but the implementation at the very beginning had certain flaws,” Li said.  “On the one hand, the central government really needs to have confidence that whatever is going to happen in Hong Kong, no one will challenge that Hong Kong is part of China and its sovereignty is supreme,” he said.  “On the other hand unless the Hong Kong people ultimately enjoy universal suffrage, they will always consider any efforts not to allow them that to affect “one country, two systems”.  Hong Kong protesters are demanding universal suffrage, an independent inquiry into claims of police brutality, amnesty for those charged, and that the government and police stop calling protesters “rioters”.

Police also used tear gas to disperse hundreds of protesters, many dressed in black and wearing now-banned face masks, in Nathan Road, one of the main arteries of Kowloon on the other side of the harbor.  Protesters have for five months taken to the streets of the Chinese-ruled city in a sometimes violent response to perceived Chinese meddling with its promised freedoms. This was the first time Lan Kwai Fong had been targeted.  Shouts of “Give us back Halloween!” rang out as police used their shields to push the crowds forward on the sloping, narrow streets, scene of a deadly New Year stampede nearly 27 years ago.  Revelers and some demonstrators were penned in by police trying to keep the protesters away.  Many of the protesters wore the Guy Fawkes masks made popular by anti-establishment hackers, others wore the clown make-up of the deranged title figure in the movie “Joker”. One was dressed up as Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam in a dog collar and on a leash.  (For an infographic on weapons and tactics used by Hong Kong police and protesters - here)  The gridlock infuriated protesters and drinkers alike.  “Stop blocking the road. Fuck you!” they shouted at police. “We want to drink. Can’t you let people have some fun for once?”  “Chinese bullies!” another roared. “This is overkill. It’s “Halloween!”  “China is an evil Communist country,” said Larry, 26, a social worker enjoying a drink in Lan Kwai Fong. “China is trying to put its dirty hands on Hong Kong, trying to stop our freedoms. No!”  Police raised many blue warning banners reading “Disperse or we may use force”, before firing volleys of tear gas at protesters in Central, below Lan Kwai Fong, which hung in the air above the narrow streets lined with luxury shopping malls, banks and jewelery shops.  The protesters were dispersed in all directions, but some played cat-and-mouse with police late into the night.  Most weekends see hordes of revelers spilling out of the bars and clubs on to the streets in and around Lan Kwai Fong, which got going as an entertainment area in the late 1970s and early 1980s with clubs like “Disco Disco” and “Club ‘97”, named after the year Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule.  A stampede during New Year celebrations on Dec. 31, 1992, when thousands had gathered on streets slippery with beer and champagne, killed at least 20 people and wounded scores.  As widely expected, Hong Kong slid into recession for the first time since the global financial crisis in the third quarter, according to data released on Thursday, weighed down by the increasingly violent anti-government protests and the protracted U.S.-China trade war.  Questioned about government plans to relieve the pressure that the protests are putting on businesses in Hong Kong, Lam told a conference the circumstances warranted “exceptional” measures.  Her administration has pledged around HK$21 billion ($2.7 billion) of financial aid for businesses since August, partly from rent and fuel subsidies.  The protesters say Beijing’s is interfering more and more in Hong Kong, which returned from British to Chinese rule under a “one country, two systems” formula intended to guarantee freedoms that mainland citizens do not have.  China denies meddling and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.  China said after a meeting of its top leadership that it would safeguard Hong Kong’s prosperity and protect national security.   Some protesters in Hong Kong have thrown petrol bombs at police, lit fires and vandalized government buildings and businesses, especially those seen as pro-Beijing, during recent demonstrations.   Police have responded with tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, water cannon and sometimes live rounds.  In Kowloon, the protests in the Mong Kok area marked two months since police beat protesters on a subway train as they cowered on the floor, CCTV footage of which was widely shown online. 	Reuters

The protesters say they will march, without police permission, from a park in the Causeway Bay shopping district through the heaving bar streets of Wan Chai to the steep, narrow foothills of the Peak above Central.  Every weekend, office-goers and clubbers spill out of the Lan Kwai Fong bars on to the streets, even without the additional presence of protesters who have thrown petrol bombs at police, set fires and trashed buildings during five months of unrest.  A stampede at midnight on New Year’s Eve in 1992, when thousands had gathered, killed at least 20 and wounded scores.  This month Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam banned protesters from wearing face masks under a resuscitated British colonial-era emergency law, but few have taken any notice.  Halloween masks have not been banned, which will make it difficult for police - who have responded to the violence with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon - to identify protesters.  Police said they would close some roads, including the short, L-shaped Lan Kwai Fong itself, from early afternoon on Thursday until the next morning “to facilitate the public celebrating”. It was not immediately clear how that would work.    “Based on past experience, such unauthorized assembly will impose serious threat to public order and public safety,” police said in a statement.  “Members of the public should avoid traveling to the concerned area when public disorder occurs.”      Protesters are angry at what they see as Beijing’s increasing interference in Hong Kong, which returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula intended to guarantee freedoms not seen on the mainland. Some are increasingly focusing their fury on mainland Chinese in the city.  China denies meddling and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.  Lam said she expected negative economic growth in the Asian financial hub this year, in part as a result of the unrest.  “The increasingly violent reality since June is hurting Hong Kong’s economy,” Lam said in a speech on Wednesday. “...what started off as peaceful protests, a hallmark of Hong Kong’s rights and freedoms, have turned into violent acts by rioters.”  With visitors deterred by months of violence, many small firms across the city have already closed or are struggling to turn a profit.   Lam’s made her gloomy forecast two days after Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong had slipped into a technical recession, meaning two successive quarters of contraction. That is expected to be confirmed by Thursday’s third-quarter GDP data.

The group beat revenue forecasts for the period by a large margin and confounded expectations for a slowdown from a quarter earlier, even though momentum in Hong Kong faltered as street protests there put off tourists and consumers.  L’Oreal, home to pricier skincare and make-up brands such as Lancome as well as more mass-market labels such as Garnier shampoo, said demand within mainland China was still thriving, and it did well in India and Japan too.   “We still see a very strong appetite from the young generation (in China) for luxury beauty products, so we’re confident,” Chief Executive Jean-Paul Agon told a conference call.   “Of course it was not the same in Hong Kong where the market has really slowed down, but we think we have recovered that in other Chinese regions.”  Luxury goods companies and retailers have felt the pinch during months of pro-democracy demonstrations the Chinese-ruled city which also forced shops to temporarily shut their doors.   Nivea maker Beiersdorf (BEIG.DE), a L’Oreal rival, earlier on Tuesday reported a dip in sales growth for its premium La Prairie skin lines due to the Hong Kong protests.  L’Oreal’s Asian sales were up 22.6% on a like-for-like basis, which strips out currency swings and acquisitions - only a touch below the 25.5% growth notched up a quarter earlier.   Overall, the group’s third-quarter sales were up 11% to 7.18 billion euros ($7.98 billion), rising 7.8% like-for-like and  far surpassing the 6.3% increase expected by analysts.  “Sales growth remained outstanding,” analysts at Berstein said in a note, adding that it was the strongest quarterly pace recorded by the firm for almost 12 years.   L’Oreal is hoping some of its recent splurges on perfume licences - which include those for Mugler and Valentino - could also prove a pocket of future growth in China. Fragrances are still a smaller business there than in other regions, but consumers are starting to develop a taste for them, Agon added.   The United States remained a weaker spot for L’Oreal in the third quarter, as demand for make-up there stalled.  And the group, like Beiersdorf, is still struggling to kickstart its mass-market brands, generally sold in supermarkets, as consumers gravitate towards higher-end skincare alternatives, or quirky new labels.

257	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N27A6QT	October 28, 2019 /  6:56 PM / in 5 months	De Beers banks on 'diamonds are for me'	LONDON (Reuters) - Anglo American (AAL.L) unit De Beers said its 2019 marketing budget will exceed last year’s figure of $170 million and will focus on the biggest market the United States, where women lavishing diamonds on themselves has boosted sales.  While U.S. demand has held firm, the diamond market has weakened elsewhere and trade tensions and protests in Hong Kong have dented sales in China, the second largest diamond market.  But luxury groups see potential for growth in jewelry demand, as shown by LVMH’s (LVMH.PA) nearly $14.5 billion offer, made public on Monday, to buy Tiffany & Co (TIF.N).    Esther Oberbeck, group head of strategy at De Beers, the world’s biggest diamond producer by value, said in an interview the company was about to launch new marketing campaigns, focused on the U.S. and China.   She did not specify the budget, but said De Beers’ 2019 spend would exceed last year’s $170 million and was the highest in more than a decade.  The campaigns, which she said would concentrate on “self-purchase and the bridal market”, are based on research carried out for De Beers, published on Monday.  It found the share of U.S. women buying their own engagement ring doubled from 7% to 14% over the five-year period 2013-2017 and that women on average spent a third more than men – $4,400 compared with $3,300.  De Beers sells rough diamonds and jewelry through its Forevermark brand.  Its research anticipates the rough diamond market will recover from a period of oversupply as some mines reach their end of their lives, notably Rio Tinto’s (RIO.L) (RIO.AX) Argyle mine in Australia.  Global consumer demand for diamonds rose by 2% in 2018 to $76 billion and, in dollar terms, China and the United States were the fastest-growing regions, both increasing by 5% year on year, it said.  Demand for diamond jewelry in the U.S. rose by 5% to $36 billion, representing just under half of total global diamond jewelry demand, underpinned by “solid macro-economic factors”, the De Beers research found.  Diamonds are still the leading choice for engagement rings,  whether between same-sex or heterosexual couples.  But demand for diamond jewelry as a gift to mark all kinds of special occasions, including rewards to oneself, now outweighs demand directly related to weddings, De Beers said.     	Reuters

Quinn branded the lender’s sluggish performance in Europe and the United States as “not acceptable”, but said investors may have to wait until early next year to hear his full plans to “remodel” Europe’s biggest bank by assets.  The latest HSBC restructuring comes in a gloomy business environment, including an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war, Britain’s protracted withdrawal from the European Union, an easing monetary policy cycle, and unrest in Hong Kong.  HSBC reported pre-tax profit of $4.8 billion for the third quarter on Monday, compared with the $5.3 billion average of analysts’ forecasts.  “Overall a poor set of results,” said analyst Edward Firth at broker KBW.  “But the good news is that this performance looks set to finally goad the management into taking some of the actions to address underperforming businesses that we have been awaiting.”  The bank’s shares fell 3% in London on Monday morning, against a 0.5% dip in the STOXX European banks index.   The earnings update is HSBC’s first under Quinn, and is widely seen by shareholders and insiders as a report card on his audition for the CEO role full-time.  “Our previous plans are no longer sufficient to improve performance for these businesses, given the softer outlook for revenue growth,” Quinn said of the bank’s U.S. and European operations.  As a result of a “more challenging” revenue outlook compared with the first half of the year, HSBC said it did not expect to meet its return on tangible equity (RoTE) target of 11% in 2020.  A veteran of the bank since 1987, Quinn, 57, has made it clear he is keen to secure the permanent appointment of CEO from Chairman Mark Tucker, who said in August the search to replace the ousted John Flint would take six to 12 months.  One of Quinn’s biggest headaches is HSBC’s U.S. retail banking business, which has struggled for years against much bigger domestic rivals and where it booked a loss of $189 million in the first nine months of the year.  Some analysts have said the bank could look to shut down the business, but Quinn dismissed the notion.  “You should not read into anything I’ve said that we are looking to exit the retail bank in the U.S.,” he said on Monday, without ruling out scaling it back.  HSBC’s investment bank is another sore spot, with profits down 22% in the first nine months of the year.   Its trading businesses in particular had a tougher third quarter than U.S. peers, with revenue down 22% in fixed income, currencies and commodities, and down 26% in equities.  Quinn said the bank, which generates the bulk of its revenue and profit in Asia, would shift capital away from low-return businesses and further cut costs by simplifying HSBC’s notoriously complicated management structure.  “There is scope throughout the bank to clarify and simplify roles, and to reduce duplication,” Quinn told Reuters.  Such action could result in significant costs in the fourth quarter and beyond, including the possible impairment of goodwill and additional restructuring charges, the bank said.  The near- to medium-term outlook for HSBC, and rival Standard Chartered PLC, has also been clouded by anti-government protests in Hong Kong, their single biggest profit centre.  HSBC said its expected credit losses - including a “charge to reflect the economic outlook in Hong Kong” - increased by $400 million in the third quarter. Revenue for the first nine months of the year in Hong Kong, however, rose 7%.  “Obviously the economy is getting impacted by two things - the U.S.-China trade dispute and the protests,” said Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson.  The bank is particularly monitoring its portfolio of small business customers who may be feeling the strain, he added. 	Reuters

Black-clad and masked demonstrators set fire to shops and hurled petrol bombs at police on Sunday following a now-familiar pattern, with police responding with tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets.  TV footage showed protesters, who streamed into the Kowloon hotel and shopping artery of Nathan Road on Sunday, setting fire to street barricades and squirting petrol from plastic bottles on to fires at subway entrances amid running battles with police.  At one station, activists rolled a flaming metal barrel down a long staircase toward police below.  “The blow (from the protests) to our economy is comprehensive,” Paul Chan said in a blog post, adding that a preliminary estimate for third-quarter GDP on Thursday would show two successive quarters of contraction - the technical definition of a recession.  He also said it would be “extremely difficult” to achieve the government’s pre-protest forecast of 0-1 % annual economic growth.  The rallying cry of Sunday’s protests was to fight perceived police brutality and defend Muslims and journalists. Police last weekend fired water cannon at a group of people standing outside a mosque and journalists have been wounded in clashes.   The programming staff union of public broadcaster RTHK said on Monday it had called on police to identify officers who “attacked and ripped the face mask” off one of its journalists on Sunday. It said she was wearing a reflective vest clearly identifying herself as a journalist.  Pictures circulating online suggested she was wearing a gas mask, to protect against tear gas and pepper spray. Ordinary face masks were banned this month under a resurrected colonial-era emergency law.  Hong Kong Free Press, an online news service, called for the release of a freelance photographer arrested on Sunday after she had asked to see a police officer’s warrant card.  The city’s Foreign Correspondents’ Club condemned the arrest in a statement calling for an independent investigation into “police violence against journalists and interference with the media’s right to cover the protests under Hong Kong law”.  The police, who deny using excessive force, told reporters they had repeatedly asked journalists to keep their distance so police can do their job.  They said an officer had removed a journalist’s mask, which had seemed an “undesirable” incident, but they said they did not know the full context. The Hong Kong Free Press reporter was arrested for failing to show ID and being uncooperative and obstructing police.  Protesters have routinely torched store fronts and businesses including banks, particularly those owned by mainland Chinese companies and vandalized the city’s MTR Corp metro which has shut down services to stop protesters gathering.   The MTR has closed early for the past few weeks and said it will again shut down two hours early on Monday to repair damage.  Protesters are angry about what they view as increasing interference by Beijing in Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula intended to guarantee freedoms not seen on the mainland.  China denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.  Tourists numbers have plummeted, with visitor numbers down nearly 50 percent in October, a decline Chan called an “emergency”.  Retail operators, from prime shopping malls to family-run businesses, have been forced to close for multiple days over the past few months.  While authorities have announced measures to support local small and medium seized enterprises, Chan said the measures could only “slightly reduce the pressure”.    “Let citizens return to normal life, let industry and commerce operate normally, and create more space for rational dialogue,” he wrote.

The protesters, many in all-black clothing and face-masks now banned under a resurrected British colonial-era law, had gathered to denounce perceived police brutality during more than four months of often-violent unrest in the Chinese-ruled city.  It was the 21st straight weekend of protests, marked by a notable rise in the jeering and verbal abuse of police but not in the scale of violence. Police said one man was beaten up by “masked rioters”.  “The police warn all rioters to stop all illegal acts immediately,” they said in a statement.  But cat-and-mouse chases continued into the night, with protesters running away from water cannon and tear gas, only to re-appear seconds or minutes later.  There was a standoff as dusk fell, with protesters, bemused tourists and passers-by gathered on the pavements of the shopping and hotel artery of Nathan Road, which police had earlier cleared in slow-moving cordons.  Riot police stood by outside the Chungking Mansions high-rise warren of South Asian restaurants and backpacker hostels,  shields and batons at the ready. Protesters shouted obscenities in colorful Cantonese at “black police”, referring to their perceived over-use of force.  “Fight for Hong Kong!” protesters shouted, “five demands, not one less”, a reference to demands for universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into police actions, among other things.  Police later moved away, leaving protesters, pedestrians and tourists alike to take over the street under the neon lights. Then one water cannon moved in, firing high into the air and down side-streets.   Police said protesters later hurled petrol bombs at a police station in Sham Shui Po, northwest of Tsim Sha Tsui, and set fire to shops in Jordan, north along Nathan Road from the harbor.  Reuters witnesses saw two MTR entrances on fire in Mong Kok.  The number of protesters had grown by the minute earlier in the afternoon, streaming down Nathan Road to the water’s edge, in front of the dramatic backdrop of Hong Kong island, but many fled after the tear gas and pepper spray were fired.  Ambulances took one man away on a stretcher. The need for treatment was not immediately clear.  Police detained some protesters as they gathered in a rally that had not received official permission. The crowds at the waterfront had largely dispersed after a couple of hours and headed north up Nathan Road, where many luxury brand shops closed their shutters, toward Jordan and Mong Kok.  The rallying cry of the protesters was also for the protection of “Muslims, journalists and the people”.  A police water cannon fired bursts of blue-dyed water at a small group of people outside a Nathan Road mosque during protests last weekend, drawing criticism from some in the Muslim community. There was a large crowd of police outside the mosque on Sunday.  Billy, 26, a salesman who did not want to give his full name, said he turned out on Sunday because he was angry at the spraying of the mosque a week earlier.  “Hong Kong people, regardless of our religion ... we come here to say no to our totalitarian government,” he told Reuters, adding he wanted to protest peacefully. “I have a little bit of fear ... because our police sometimes they are uncontrollable and they threaten the safety of our people.”   Cindy Chu, 65, a retired nurse, said the police used to be a force for good.  “It’s so simple. They are disturbing the Hong Kong people,” she said. “And what for? What authority do they have to do that? It’s Hong Kong, not China.”  She too was wearing a face mask.  Pro-democracy activists have in recent weeks attacked police with petrol bombs and rocks and slashed one officer in the neck with a knife. Police have responded with tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and occasional live rounds, wounding several protesters and a few journalists.  Police deny accusations of brutality, saying they have shown restraint. There had been a week-long lull in clashes.  Protesters are angry about what they view as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula intended to guarantee freedoms not seen on the mainland.  China denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.  Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on his blog that the quarter-on-quarter contraction recorded in the three months ending in June had extended into the third quarter.   Two successive quarters of contraction are the technical definition of a recession. 	Reuters

AIA and other insurers in Hong Kong get a large share of their sales from selling insurance products to China visitors who are seeking better products and overseas investment opportunities.  Anti-government demonstrations in the Chinese-ruled territory, which began in June, have resulted in a sharp drop in tourist arrivals, mainly those from the mainland, hitting sales of luxury goods and insurance policies, among other things.  On Sunday, the protesters set fire to shops and hurled petrol bombs, after riot police fired tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets to disperse thousands in the Tsim Sha Tsui harbour-front hotel district.  Hong Kong-headquartered AIA on Monday joined other companies to flag concerns about the impact of the protests on domestic business activities, with the city facing its first recession in a decade.  “Some of our markets are experiencing headwinds from the lower interest rate environment, falling consumer confidence and rising political and trade tensions,” the company said in its earnings statement.  “In particular, the reduced numbers of Mainland Chinese visitors to Hong Kong continue to affect sales.”  AIA reported on Monday that overall new business value grew 1% to $980 million in the three months to Sept. 30, which was better than some analysts’ expectations, sparking a rise in the company’s shares.  Excluding Hong Kong, new business grew 14%, with mainland China emerging as its “fastest-growing” market in the quarter, the insurer said.  AIA posted a double-digit decline in value of new business (VONB), which measures expected profit from new premiums and is a key indicator of growth, in Hong Kong, the insurer said.  “Double-digit VONB growth from domestic customers was offset by a decline in VONB from Mainland Chinese visitors which broadly tracked the reduction in overall visitor arrivals to Hong Kong reported in July and August,” it said.  The company did not elaborate on its Hong Kong numbers in the statement.  The insurance firm, whose business was first established in Shanghai nearly a century ago, now has a presence in 18 markets in the Asia Pacific. Hong Kong accounts for the biggest share of its new business.  Besides Hong Kong, AIA counts Australia, China, Indonesia,  Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand among its other major markets.  Shares in AIA rose as much as 4% after its results despite the insurer’s tepid quarterly performance. The stock had fallen 12.1% in the July-September quarter, amid investor worries about the impact of the protests on its business.     Daiwa Capital Markets analyst Leon Qi said that the overall numbers were better than market expectations. Qi said he had expected the value of new business to drop 2% due to the pressure on its Hong Kong business. 	Reuters

The protesters, many in all-black clothing and face-masks now banned under a resurrected British colonial-era law, had gathered to denounce perceived police brutality during more than four months of often-violent unrest in the Chinese-ruled city.

China's riding to the rescue of luxury brands	BEIJING/LONDON (Reuters) - When Tiffany & Co said this month it was sending its priciest jewelry to mainland China to reach wealthy shoppers no longer jet-setting abroad, it reflected a trend helping global luxury brands weather a Chinese economic slowdown.   Well-off Chinese consumers, whose trips to fashion capitals like New York and Paris have long buttressed luxury-sector sales, are increasingly staying at home because of a weaker yuan currency which has blunted their overseas firepower.   Hong Kong, another top shopping destination, has also become less appealing due to mass anti-government protests that have erupted into violence on some occasions.  However third-quarter earnings showed that, despite China’s economic growth slowing to a three-decade low, shoppers are continuing to spend heavily on luxury - but they are doing it at home or online, with their wallets reinforced by savings on flights, hotels and other steep holiday costs.   Several large U.S. and European luxury brands reported strong demand for their goods in China, even as Beijing and Washington remain embroiled in a trade war.  Lisa, a finance worker in her late 20s, is among Chinese shoppers who are increasingly turning their eyes away from foreign shores.   “I don’t feel like there is such a big gap anymore between prices overseas and at home, so when I feel like making a purchase I usually just go straight to the store these days,” she told Reuters outside a Hermes outlet in Shanghai.  Hermes (HRMS.PA), known for its leather goods, printed silk scarves and Birkin bags that cost $10,000 or more, said its stores in mainland China had outstanding results that helped fuel a 19% sales gain in the wider region.  The French company opened its 26th boutique in China in July in Xiamen and continues to build out its e-commerce site for Chinese customers, hermes.cn, launched a year ago. Italy’s Moncler is meanwhile studying expanding the size of its stores in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.   “The whole economy is slowing down and salary growth is also slowing. So consumers who originally bought when they traveled will now buy domestically,” said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING.   She added a cut to sales taxes this year which prompted some luxury brands to lower their prices in China could also be an attraction.  The strength in China has helped insulate luxury companies from a major financial hit from months of pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong that have forced them to temporarily close shops and which have kept tourists away.  Kering’s (PRTP.PA) Gucci fashion label, for example, said it has managed to make up for lost business in the former British colony due to spending shifting back to mainland China.  The turmoil is far from over, however, with protests in Hong Kong descending into clashes between demonstrators and police this week.  In the United States, meanwhile, Tiffany (TIF.N) boss Alessandro Bogliolo told Reuters this month the company was pursuing Chinese buyers who were staying at home, saying it needed to “follow customers where they shop”.   He has sent high-end jewelry including diamond necklaces costing $1 million or more to its stores in mainland China from New York.       The demand for luxury in China may even be aiding more mass-market players like personal care products maker Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), which raised its global sales forecasts on the back of premium beauty brands such as China Olay.  Emma Zhang, a 32-year-old investment analyst in Shanghai, said she was indulging more in what she said were little luxuries.  “I used to be the type to buy many cheap items, and would change them frequently,” she said. “My shopping habits have changed and I’ve been buying things that are better quality.” 	Reuters

The FTSE 100, which had hovered at a near one-month high in the last two sessions, closed with a 0.1% dip. The FTSE 250 lost 0.2%, led lower by a 9.4% fall in Synthomer after the polymer maker issued a profit warning.  Brexit updates have been the driving force behind a roller-coaster ride for the domestic market over the last few weeks.  While sentiment had improved for battered sectors such as housebuilders after Prime Minister Boris Johnson sealed a new Brexit deal, caution returned as lawmakers rejected his timeline for the deal’s passage.  Parliament forced Johnson to ask for another extension to the departure date, but the European Union has yet to give a go-ahead to the request. Comments from a source close to French President Emmanuel Macron that the delay is not justified at this stage exacerbated worries.  Housebuilders dipped 0.2% on the sector’s fifth straight session in the negative territory.  UK midcaps suffered a bigger hit versus the FTSE 100 on the back of a continued weakness in the pound due to the political tug of war over the course of Brexit.  “Markets may not be fully comfortable with diving head first into riskier assets, until there is greater certainty surrounding the US-China trade conflict and Brexit,” FXTM analyst Han Tan said.  Helping limit losses on the main index, Barclays advanced 2.4% after reporting a third-quarter profit that topped analysts’ expectations.  WPP, the world’s biggest ad firm, jumped 6.1% after it reported a return to quarterly organic sales growth for the first time in over a year, with a new strategy from boss Mark Read helping the company win more work.  “The turnaround at the advertising giant WPP appears to be gaining some traction,” AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.  Another notable gainer was luxury goods company Burberry , which added 2.1% as results from Gucci parent Kering and Italian jacket maker Moncler allayed some concerns of a major hit to sales from the Hong Kong protests.  National Grid weighed with a 2.4% drop after media outlets reported that New York governor had signalled to cancel the utility’s licence if it fails to cooperate with state officials regarding a moratorium on natural gas connections.

In a major policy speech on China that touched on an array of disputes ahead of talks with Beijing to ease a trade war, Pence said the United States does not seek confrontation or to “de-couple” from its main economic rival.  But he pulled no punches when addressing some of the political rifts between the two countries.  Criticizing China’s construction of a “surveillance state,” and “increasingly provocative” military action, Pence held up Taiwan’s Democracy as a better path for Chinese people and took Beijing to task for its handling of pro-democracy protests that have rocked Hong Kong for more than four months.  “Hong Kong is a living example of what can happen when China embraces liberty,” he said. “And yet, for the last few years, Beijing has increased its interventions in Hong Kong and engaged in actions that curtail the rights and liberties that Hong Kong’s people were guaranteed through a binding international agreement.”  He said the United States stands with the protesters in Hong Kong, millions of whom have taken to the streets in sometimes violent clashes over what they see as China’s tightening grip.   “We stand with you, we are inspired by you. We urge you to stay on the path of non-violent protest,” Pence said in his address at a Washington think tank.              He also slammed China for its treatment of Muslim Uighurs in the Xinjiang region.   Pence directed some of his harshest words at sports apparel giant Nike (NKE.N) and the NBA, which he accused of siding with China’s Communist Party over freedom of speech in Hong Kong.  The vice president, who is often the face of the Trump administration’s tougher policies on China, said the NBA and Nike had failed to defend basketball team Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, after he tweeted support of Hong Kong protesters earlier this month.       “Some of the NBA’s biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of other peoples,” he said.   By “siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime,” Pence said.   Nike stores in China removed Rockets merchandise after Beijing criticized Morey, Pence noted.   “Nike promotes itself as a so-called social-justice champion, but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door,” he said.   Pence said “far too many American multinational corporations have kowtowed to the lure of China’s money and markets by muzzling not only criticism of the Chinese Communist Party, but even affirmative expressions of American values.”   Nike, the NBA and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the remarks.  Influential Chinese state-backed newspaper the Global Times, however, said in an editorial that while Pence reiterated many of his previous criticisms, there was still “room for optimism.”  “He emphasized the U.S. does not want to ‘decouple’ and repeated how U.S. President Donald Trump is willing to start a new future with China,” it said.  The closely watched speech set a discordant tone just weeks before a summit in Chile where U.S. President Donald Trump hopes to finalize a partial trade deal with China’s Xi Jinping.   The S&P 500 U.S. stock index briefly moved lower after his comments.  Analysts said Pence’s speech appeared aimed at keeping the way open for a trade deal while seeking to convince Trump’s support base that he was tough on China going into the 2020 election.  Douglas Paal, a China expert with Washington’s Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, called it “a superficial and political speech, not a guiding strategic document.”  Scott Kennedy, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, saw it as an bid to provide rationale for “policy moves on security, economics and politics which originally were much less coordinated and less integrated.”    A new round of talks between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese officials to try to end the bruising trade dispute is set for Friday.  The United States launched a trade war with China 15 months ago, alleging unfair trading practices such as theft of U.S. intellectual property and generous industrial subsidies at the expense of foreign competitors.      Fears of antagonizing Beijing had prompted the White House to postpone Pence’s speech, which was originally scheduled for June, ahead of a meeting Trump and Xi aimed at getting trade talks back on track.   Many China watchers had expected Pence to tread lightly on sensitive topics on Thursday, in sharp contrast to the bombastic tone of his first major China policy address a year ago. But some saw signs of a rapprochement as well.   “In contrast to the Hudson Institute speech of October 2018, the Vice President’s equally hard-hitting Wilson speech offered the beginnings of a positive vision for U.S.-China relations,” said Robert Daly of the Kissinger Institute on China.    Pence said the United States was “not seeking to contain China’s development.” “We want a constructive relationship with China’s leaders,” he said, calling on Beijing to “seize this unique moment in history to start anew by ending the trade practices that have taken advantage of the American people for far too long.” 	Reuters

European stock markets traded broadly softer with the pan regional STOXX 600 slipping 0.3%, with Germany’s DAX eased 0.2% while Britain’s FTSE fell 0.4%.  Losses were led by the food and beverage sector weighed after the world’s largest beer maker by Anheuser-Busch InBev tumbled 9% on disappointing quarterly profit and a glum outlook as the earnings season rumbled on.  Yet a luxury goods rally led by Kering helped lift France’s CAC index 0.1% after its star fashion label Gucci posted stronger-than-expected sales, demonstrating how some brands have managed to shield from the fallout over protests in Hong Kong.  Meanwhile lacklustre data did little to quell underlying concerns over the health of the global economy. Germany’s Ifo business climate came in broadly unchanged while the mood among consumers in the block’s largest economy fell to its lowest in three years heading into November as job losses in the auto and financial sector made shoppers more pessimistic about the outlook for Europe’s biggest economy.  “We may have reached the bottom in the euro zone, but there is still uncertainty that is troublesome in the U.S. Many accounts will be waiting for the Fed,” said Cyril Regnat, a fixed income strategist at Natixis, referring to next week’s meeting of the U.S. central bank with markets pricing a 90% chance of a rate cut.  The lacklustre performance in Europe follows a mixed picture in Asia where Japan’s Nikkei finished up 0.2% and Chinese blue-chips gained 0.6% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.28%.  U.S. futures pointed to a flat open on Wall Street following a mixed Thursday, which saw strong quarterly results from Microsoft and PayPal lift the Nasdaq 0.8% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1% after 3M slashed its full-year earnings outlook.  Meanwhile Amazon.com Inc shares will be in focus after the company on Thursday forecast revenue and profit for the holiday quarter below expectations on fierce competition and rising costs from its plan to speed up delivery times globally  Trade talks are also back in focus with U.S. and Chinese trade officials due to discuss plans for China to buy more U.S. farm products while Beijing in return will request cancellation of some planned and existing U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.  The two sides are working to try to agree on a text for a “Phase 1” trade agreement announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on Oct. 11, in time for him to sign it with China’s President Xi Jinping next month at a summit in Chile. Though there are still large gaps to bridge.  However, a speech by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday, which criticised China’s handling of the Hong Kong protests and its treatment of Muslim Uighurs in the Xinjiang region, did jangle nerves.  “Geopolitical concerns such as the global trade war are keeping investor optimism in check,” said Paula Polito, client strategy officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, adding the firm’s latest survey had found that investors had opted to raise their holdings of cash well above usual levels.  A Reuters poll of economists showed that most think a steeper decline in global growth is more likely than a synchronised recovery, despite central bank easing.  In his last meeting as president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi left ECB policy and guidance unchanged, but advised his successor to “never give up” on propping up the eurozone economy in the face of a worsening outlook.  In currency markets, the dollar traded flat against a basket of six major currencies while the euro steadied after falling to a one-week low against the U.S. dollar in the previous session on the ECB leaving the door open for more monetary policy easing, but keeping interest rates unchanged.  The British pound edged down to $1.2823, extending a 0.5% drop on Thursday, after European Union failed to set a date for Britain’s departure from the bloc while the UK parliament squabbled over Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s call for a December election to break the deadlock.  Johnson conceded on Thursday for the first time that he would not meet his “do or die” deadline to leave the European Union next week.  “Because the UK Parliament passed the EU withdrawal agreement, we think downside for GBP will be limited,” said Peter Kinsella, head of FX strategy at UBP. “However, the lead time until the general election may prevent material GBP appreciation until after the election.”  EU ambassadors agreed in principle to a delay beyond the Oct. 31 deadline, but will not decide the length of the extension until Monday or Tuesday, an official said.  Euro zone bond markets have largely shrugged off the latest Brexit events, with the benchmark 10-year German government yield up 2 basis point at -0.38%.  The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes also held steady.  Oil prices steadied after suffering falls earlier in the session, but were on track for strong weekly gains as support from a surprise draw in U.S. inventories and possible action from OPEC and its allies to trim production further outweighed broader economic concerns.  West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude stood at $56.17 a barrel and global benchmark Brent crude at $61.62 per barrel. 	Reuters

Kering shares were on track for their best day in a year in early trading, with the stock up just over 8% following its sales update on Thursday evening. Moncler (MONC.MI) shares were also rising, up 6% after the Italian puffer jacket maker’s third quarter sales beat expectations.

Kering shares were on track for their best day in a year in early trading, with the stock up just over 8% following its sales update on Thursday evening.

European stock markets opened broadly softer with the pan regional STOXX 600 slipping 0.3%, with Germany’s DAX eased 0.1% while Britain’s FTSE fell 0.4%.  Losses were led by the food and beverage sector weighed after the world’s largest beer maker by Anheuser-Busch InBev tumbled 9% on disappointing quarterly profit and a glum outlook as the earnings season rumbled on.  Meanwhile lacklustre data did little to quell underlying concerns over the health of the global economy. Germany’s Ifo business climate came in broadly unchanged while the mood among consumers in the block’s largest economy fell to its lowest in three years heading into November as job losses in the auto and financial sector made shoppers more pessimistic about the outlook for Europe’s biggest economy.  “We may have reached the bottom in the euro zone, but there is still uncertainty that is troublesome in the U.S. Many accounts will be waiting for the Fed,” said Cyril Regnat, a fixed income strategist at Natixis, referring to next week’s meeting of the U.S. central bank with markets pricing a 90% chance of a rate cut.  The losses in Europe follow a mixed performance in Asia where Japan’s Nikkei finished up 0.2% and Chinese blue-chips gained 0.6% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.28%.  U.S. futures pointed to a flat open on Wall Street following a mixed Thursday, which saw strong quarterly results from Microsoft and PayPal lift the Nasdaq 0.8% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1% after 3M slashed its full-year earnings outlook.  Meanwhile Amazon.com Inc shares will be in focus after the company on Thursday forecast revenue and profit for the holiday quarter below expectations on fierce competition and rising costs from its plan to speed up delivery times globally  Trade talks are also back in focus with U.S. and Chinese trade officials due to discuss plans for China to buy more U.S. farm products while Beijing in return will request cancellation of some planned and existing U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.  The two sides are working to try to agree on a text for a “Phase 1” trade agreement announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on Oct. 11, in time for him to sign it with China’s President Xi Jinping next month at a summit in Chile. Though there are still large gaps to bridge.  However, a speech by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday, which criticised China’s handling of the Hong Kong protests and its treatment of Muslim Uighurs in the Xinjiang region, did jangle nerves.  “Geopolitical concerns such as the global trade war are keeping investor optimism in check,” said Paula Polito, client strategy officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, adding the firm’s latest survey had found that investors had opted to raise their holdings of cash well above usual levels.  A Reuters poll of economists showed that most think a steeper decline in global growth is more likely than a synchronised recovery, despite central bank easing.  In his last meeting as president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi left ECB policy and guidance unchanged, but advised his successor to “never give up” on propping up the eurozone economy in the face of a worsening outlook.  In currency markets, the dollar traded flat against a basket of six major currencies while the euro steadied after falling to a one-week low against the U.S. dollar in the previous session on the ECB leaving the door open for more monetary policy easing, but keeping interest rates unchanged.  The British pound edged down to $1.2845, extending a 0.5% drop on Thursday, as investors waited for a European Union decision on a Brexit extension after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for a December general election.  Johnson conceded on Thursday for the first time that he would not meet his “do or die” deadline to leave the European Union next week.  EU envoys will discuss the length of another delay to Brexit at a meeting on Friday. An EU official said the choice was between three months and a “two-tier” lag but warned that a decision might not come just yet.  Euro zone bond markets have largely shrugged off the latest Brexit events, with the bechmark 10-year German government yield up 1 basis point at -0.395%.  The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes also held steady.  Oil prices fell on the day but were on track for strong weekly gains as support from a surprise draw in U.S. inventories and possible action from OPEC and its allies to trim production further outweighed broader economic concerns.  West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 0.4% to $55.99 a barrel, and global benchmark Brent crude dipped 0.3% to $61.45 per barrel. 	Reuters

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up just 0.05%, having spent the day oscillating between small losses and gains.  Europe looked set to be similarly directionless, with pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures up 0.06% at 3,613, German DAX futures down 0.03% at 12,864.5 and FTSE futures up 0.11% at 7,312 in early trade.  Chinese blue-chips were up by 0.56% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.28%.  Japan’s Nikkei finished up 0.22%, while the Australian share market managed a 0.68% rise.  The British pound, which fell 0.51% on Thursday after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s call for a general election on Dec. 12, extended its slide, edging down to $1.2845.  Johnson conceded on Thursday for the first time that he would not meet his “do or die” deadline to leave the European Union next week.  The continued uncertainty over Brexit comes against the backdrop of persistently sluggish global growth.  A Reuters poll of economists showed that most think a steeper decline in global growth is more likely than a synchronised recovery, despite central bank easing.  In his last meeting as president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi left ECB policy and guidance unchanged, but advised his successor to “never give up” on propping up the eurozone economy in the face of a worsening outlook.  The major focus for investors is next week’s U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting at which it’s almost certain to cut interest rates for a third time this year.  “It’s less about the Fed going to cut, it’s more about if they’re going to signal the pace, the magnitude of cuts,” said Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo Bank in Singapore.  Investors will also scrutinise a raft of data that will follow the Fed decision, he said. “It’s really all about next week.”  The Bank of Japan is also set for a two-day meeting ending Oct. 31. Its decision is expected to be a close call, though sources told Reuters the BOJ is leaning toward keeping monetary policy steady.  On Wall Street, strong quarterly results from Microsoft and PayPal helped lift the Nasdaq, which closed up 0.81% at 8,185.80.  The S&P 500 rose 0.19% on the day, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 0.11% lower at 26,805.53, weighed down by 3M after the company cut its full-year earnings forecast.  Investors remain cautious despite risk assets gains in recent weeks supported by apparent progress in Brexit negotiations and China-U.S. trade talks.  “On the whole, we conclude that we have not entered into a new ‘risk on’ phase from a broader trend perspective just yet,” said George Davis, chief technical strategist at RBC Dominion Securities.  Investors are also nervous before a summit in Chile where U.S. President Donald Trump hopes to finalise a partial trade deal with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.  Rattling confidence was a speech by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday, which criticised China’s handling of the Hong Kong protests and its treatment of Muslim Uighurs in the Xinjiang region. Those comments sent the S&P 500 index briefly lower.  The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to 1.7574% on Friday compared with its U.S. close of 1.766% on Thursday. The two-year yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 1.5777%, down from a U.S. close of 1.582%.  Expectations that the Fed will cut rates helped to lift gold prices. The precious metal was last up 0.09% to $1,504.62 per ounce.  The dollar was slightly higher against the yen at 108.66 and the euro was unchanged on the day at $1.1104.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, nudged 0.04% higher to 97.669.

In a letter bit.ly/2BEFX3r to Joseph Macguire, acting director of national intelligence, the senators raised concerns about the video-sharing platform's collection of user data and whether China censors content seen by U.S. users. The letter also suggested TikTok could be targeted by foreign influence campaigns.  Concern is growing in the United States about security and censorship issues involving TikTok, owned by Beijing-based tech company ByteDance, and other China-owned content platforms. Senator Marco Rubio has asked U.S. authorities to review allegations that the Chinese government uses TikTok for political censorship.   “With over 110 million downloads in the U.S. alone, TikTok is a potential counterintelligence threat we cannot ignore,” wrote Schumer, the Senate’s senior Democrat, and Cotton, a Republican senator from Arkansas.  They urged investigators to look into the issue of TikTok’s collection of users’ location-related data and other sensitive personal information.   TikTok has said U.S. user data is stored in the United States, but the senators noted that ByteDance is governed by Chinese laws.  This month, Rubio asked a U.S. national security panel to review ByteDance’s acquisition of Musical.ly Inc. He cited questions about why TikTok had “only had a few videos of the Hong Kong protests that have been dominating international headlines for months.”  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose product competes with TikTok particularly for younger users, also attacked the app over censorship concerns.  TikTok has said China would not have jurisdiction over the app’s content because the app does not operate in China.   “The Chinese government does not request that TikTok censor content,” a TikTok spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters. “To be clear: We do not remove videos based on the presence of Hong Kong protest content.”  The spokeswoman said TikTok did not have other details on the senators’ request.  “TikTok is committed to being a trusted and responsible corporate citizen in the U.S., which includes working with Congress and all relevant regulatory agencies,” she said.  In a separate statement published on its website on Friday, the video app said it is not influenced by any foreign government, including that of China.  “TikTok does not operate in China, nor do we have any intention of doing so in the future,” it added.  The website TikTok.com is blocked in China and the app is not available on the Chinese app store. Users of mainland China-registered mobile numbers are not able to log in either.   Still, concerns about possible foreign influence on U.S. elections through social media platforms have grown since U.S. intelligence agencies found Russia conducted a cyber-influence campaign to help elect President Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Moscow has denied the claim.  Facebook this week revealed it had suspended a network of Instagram accounts operated from Russia that targeted U.S. voters with divisive political messages ahead of next year’s presidential election.

Hundreds of Hong Kong protesters, some waving Catalan flags and banners urging “a fight for freedom together”, rallied in support of a separate Catalonia on Thursday, broaching an issue that is anathema to the city’s rulers in Beijing.  Hong Kong is now in its fifth month of protests, which have plunged it into its biggest political crisis in decades and taken a heavy toll on the economy.  A rally dubbed “Medical Workers Resisting Tyranny” is planned at Chater Garden in the heart of the financial centre on Saturday evening, with another protest, “Fight Against Police Brutality, Stand with Muslims, Citizens and Journalists”, due to take place on Sunday across the harbour in Kowloon district.  A police water cannon truck shot bursts of blue-dyed water at a small clutch of people on the footpath outside a mosque during protests in Kowloon on Sunday, hitting its gate and steps, drawing criticism from some in the Muslim community.  Police, already facing criticism for heavy-handed tactics, issued a statement saying the incident was “most unfortunate” and unintended, while senior officers went to meet Muslim leaders late at night to offer apologies.  Hong Kong was returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that allowed it to retain extensive freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.  However, many Hong Kong residents are angry at what they see as a relentless march towards mainland control.  U.S. Vice President Mike Pence accused China on Thursday of curtailing “rights and liberties” in Hong Kong and blasted U.S. company Nike and the National Basketball Association for falling in line with Beijing in a disagreement over free speech.

In a major policy speech on China that touched on an array of disputes ahead of talks with Beijing to ease a trade war, Pence said the United States does not seek confrontation or to “de-couple” from its main economic rival.  But he pulled no punches when addressing some of the political rifts between the two countries.  Criticizing China’s construction of a “surveillance state,” and “increasingly provocative” military action, Pence held up Taiwan’s Democracy as a better path for Chinese people and took Beijing to task for its handling of pro-democracy protests that have rocked Hong Kong for more than four months.  “Hong Kong is a living example of what can happen when China embraces liberty,” he said. “And yet, for the last few years, Beijing has increased its interventions in Hong Kong and engaged in actions that curtail the rights and liberties that Hong Kong’s people were guaranteed through a binding international agreement.”  He said the United States stands with the protesters in Hong Kong, millions of whom have taken to the streets in sometimes violent clashes over what they see as China’s tightening grip.   “We stand with you, we are inspired by you. We urge you to stay on the path of non-violent protest,” Pence said in his address at a Washington think tank.              He also slammed China for its treatment of Muslim Uighurs in the Xinjiang region.   Pence directed some of his harshest words at sports apparel giant Nike (NKE.N) and the NBA, which he accused of siding with China’s Communist Party over freedom of speech in Hong Kong.  The vice president, who is often the face of the Trump administration’s tougher policies on China, said the NBA and Nike had failed to defend basketball team Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, after he tweeted support of Hong Kong protesters earlier this month.       “Some of the NBA’s biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of other peoples,” he said.   By “siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime,” Pence said.   Nike stores in China removed Rockets merchandise after Beijing criticized Morey, Pence noted.   “Nike promotes itself as a so-called social-justice champion, but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door,” he said.   Pence said “far too many American multinational corporations have kowtowed to the lure of China’s money and markets by muzzling not only criticism of the Chinese Communist Party, but even affirmative expressions of American values.”   Nike, the NBA and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the remarks.  Influential Chinese state-backed newspaper the Global Times, however, said in an editorial that while Pence reiterated many of his previous criticisms, there was still “room for optimism.”  “He emphasized the U.S. does not want to ‘decouple’ and repeated how U.S. President Donald Trump is willing to start a new future with China,” it said.  The closely watched speech set a discordant tone just weeks before a summit in Chile where U.S. President Donald Trump hopes to finalize a partial trade deal with China’s Xi Jinping.   The S&P 500 U.S. stock index briefly moved lower after his comments.  Analysts said Pence’s speech appeared aimed at keeping the way open for a trade deal while seeking to convince Trump’s support base that he was tough on China going into the 2020 election.  Douglas Paal, a China expert with Washington’s Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, called it “a superficial and political speech, not a guiding strategic document.”  Scott Kennedy, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, saw it as an bid to provide rationale for “policy moves on security, economics and politics which originally were much less coordinated and less integrated.”    A new round of talks between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese officials to try to end the bruising trade dispute is set for Friday.  The United States launched a trade war with China 15 months ago, alleging unfair trading practices such as theft of U.S. intellectual property and generous industrial subsidies at the expense of foreign competitors.      Fears of antagonizing Beijing had prompted the White House to postpone Pence’s speech, which was originally scheduled for June, ahead of a meeting Trump and Xi aimed at getting trade talks back on track.   Many China watchers had expected Pence to tread lightly on sensitive topics on Thursday, in sharp contrast to the bombastic tone of his first major China policy address a year ago. But some saw signs of a rapprochement as well.   “In contrast to the Hudson Institute speech of October 2018, the Vice President’s equally hard-hitting Wilson speech offered the beginnings of a positive vision for U.S.-China relations,” said Robert Daly of the Kissinger Institute on China.    Pence said the United States was “not seeking to contain China’s development.” “We want a constructive relationship with China’s leaders,” he said, calling on Beijing to “seize this unique moment in history to start anew by ending the trade practices that have taken advantage of the American people for far too long.” 	Reuters

In early trade in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.13% higher. Australian shares added 0.66% and Japan’s Nikkei ticked up 0.15%.  The British pound, which had fallen 0.51% on Thursday after Johnson’s call for a general election on Dec. 12, extended its slide, edging down to $1.2844.  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson conceded on Thursday for the first time that he would not meet his “do or die” deadline to leave the European Union next week.  Continued uncertainty over Brexit comes against the backdrop of pertinently sluggish growth.  New orders for U.S.-made capital goods fell more than expected in September and shipments also declined, in a sign that business investment remains soft.  A Reuters poll of economists in recent weeks showed that most think a steeper decline in global growth is more likely than a synchronised recovery, despite central bank easing.  In his last meeting as president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi left ECB policy and guidance unchanged, but advised his successor to “never give up” on propping up the eurozone economy in the face of a worsening outlook.  On Wall Street, strong quarterly results from Microsoft and PayPal helped lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which closed up 0.81% at 8,185.80.  The S&P 500 also rose, gaining 0.19% on the day, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 0.11% lower at 26,805.53, weighed down by 3M after the company cut its full-year earnings forecast.  However, caution prevails despite the gains in risk assets in recent weeks, supported by apparent progress in Brexit negotiations and China-U.S. trade talks.  “On the whole, we conclude that we have not entered into a new ‘risk on’ phase from a broader trend perspective just yet,” said George Davis, chief technical strategist at RBC Dominion Securities.  Investors are also nervous ahead of a summit in Chile where U.S. President Donald Trump hopes to finalise a partial trade deal with China’s Xi Jinping.  Rattling confidence was a speech by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday, which criticised China’s handling of the Hong Kong protests and its treatment of Muslim Uighurs in the Xinjiang region. Those comments sent the S&P 500 index briefly lower.  The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was lower, falling to 1.759% compared with its U.S. close of 1.766% on Thursday. The two-year yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was down at 1.5757% compared with a U.S. close of 1.582%.  Investors are widely expecting the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for a third time this year at its monetary policy meeting next week.  Those expectations had helped to lift gold prices, but the precious metal was lower on Friday, dropping 0.14% to $1,501.10 per ounce.  The dollar gained 0.05% against the yen to 108.66 and the euro was barely lower on the day at $1.1101.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, nudged 0.05% higher to 97.680.  Oil prices were lower after rising on Thursday on a surprise drop in U.S. crude inventories and the hopes for market-supporting actions by OPEC and its allies. 	Reuters

Five months of political turmoil in the Chinese-ruled territory are set to weigh on the two London-headquartered lenders’ credit growth and asset quality in the near to medium term, people with knowledge of the matter said.   HSBC will report its third-quarter earnings on Monday, and StanChart on Wednesday.   Hong Kong accounted for 52% of HSBC’s profit before tax in the first-half of this year, while it brought in a third of StanChart’s income in the same period, as per the banks’ financial filings.  The two, which were already facing uncertainty created by the bruising U.S.-China trade war, lower interest rates and Brexit, flagged the potential risks posed by the protests in their half-yearly earnings reports published in August.  Both have now started seeing the impact of the protests on their retail and commercial banking businesses in the last couple of months, albeit in a small way, said the people with knowledge of the matter, declining to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media.  The retail banking business of the lenders are set to take a hit from sluggish demand for wealth management products, mainly insurance, due to a sharp drop in mainland visitors who are big buyers of foreign currency-denominated products, they said.  With the city’s all important tourism and retail sectors hit by the protests and many businesses forced to close, the banks’ commercial banking revenues are also expected to see a slowdown in growth in the medium-term, the people said.  “Even credit card transactions, which are a decent source of fee income, are down 15% to 30% across major banks here in the last two months as all major retail markets are closed on most weekends,” said one of the people.  “The bigger worry is the asset quality, which probably will kick in with a lag of couple of quarters and as bankruptcy filings rise.”  Bankruptcy petitions presented by debtors in Hong Kong rose by nearly a fifth in the September quarter of this year to 1,945 from the same period a year earlier, according to government data.  Two separate persons close to the lenders, however, said it might be too early for the disruption to have had a material impact on the banks’ overall earnings.  The banks, along with the government, are also rolling out supporting measures for the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in a bid to lighten the burden of the protests on the wider corporate sector and the economy.  “HSBC was the first bank to announce measures ... to support SMEs in Hong Kong,” the bank said, referring to initiatives including six-month interest rebate on loans under two government SME loan schemes announced in August.   HSBC did not comment on the impact to earnings from the measures. StanChart, which is also among banks in Hong Kong that have unveiled such initiatives, declined to comment.  HSBC is expected to post a drop of 11% in its third-quarter pre-tax profit to $5.3 billion, according to average analysts’ estimates compiled by the bank. StanChart’s quarterly profit forecast was not yet available.  Hong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade as increasingly violent protests continue.  Underscoring concerns about the outlook for corporate profits, both HSBC and StanChart have started conducting “stress tests” on some of their local clients, the people said.  “Given the huge importance of the Hong Kong market to HSBC’s profitability, should the current protests continue, it will inevitably drag on earnings,” said Ali Miremadi, investment director at GAM, who currently does not hold the lender’s stock.  The protests have also resulted in global banks, especially HSBC, given its large presence in China and Hong Kong, having to undertake a delicate balancing act as a result of heightened scrutiny of their stances on the unrest.  Internally, senior managers at HSBC have been informally told to be very sensitive in talking about or dealing with the team on issues related to the protests, people with knowledge of the matter said.  Beijing has long used different methods to punish foreign corporations that offend it.  “HSBC has absolutely no option but to go along with the government. Anything different would risk their licence to operate. Just look at what has happened to the NBA after a single tweet,” Miremadi of GAM said.  The National Basketball Association (NBA) was plunged into controversy earlier this month after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy demonstrators.   The incident has already cost the league substantial financial losses in China, a market worth an estimated $4 billion for the league. 	Reuters

In a letter bit.ly/2BEFX3r to Joseph Macguire, acting director of national intelligence, the senators raised concerns about the video-sharing platform's collection of user data and whether China censors content seen by U.S. users. The letter also suggested TikTok could be targeted by foreign influence campaigns.  Concern is growing in the United States about security and censorship issues involving TikTok, owned by Beijing-based tech company ByteDance, and other China-owned content platforms. Senator Marco Rubio has asked U.S. authorities to review allegations that the Chinese government uses TikTok for political censorship.  “With over 110 million downloads in the U.S. alone, TikTok is a potential counterintelligence threat we cannot ignore,” wrote Schumer, the Senate’s senior Democrat, and Cotton, a Republican senator from Arkansas.  They urged investigators to look into the issue of TikTok’s collection of users’ location-related data and other sensitive personal information.  TikTok has said U.S. user data is stored in the United States, but the senators noted that ByteDance is governed by Chinese laws.  This month, Rubio asked a U.S. national security panel to review ByteDance’s acquisition of Musical.ly Inc. He cited questions about why TikTok had “only had a few videos of the Hong Kong protests that have been dominating international headlines for months.”  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose product competes with TikTok particularly for younger users, also attacked the app over censorship concerns.  TikTok has said China would not have jurisdiction over the app’s content because the app does not operate in China.  “The Chinese government does not request that TikTok censor content,” a TikTok spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters. “To be clear: We do not remove videos based on the presence of Hong Kong protest content.”  The spokeswoman said TikTok did not have other details on the senators’ request.  “TikTok is committed to being a trusted and responsible corporate citizen in the U.S., which includes working with Congress and all relevant regulatory agencies,” she said.  Concerns about possible foreign influence on U.S. elections through social media platforms have grown since U.S. intelligence agencies found Russia conducted a cyber-influence campaign to help elect President Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Moscow has denied the claim. 	Reuters

In Hong Kong’s demonstrations, millions have taken to the streets in sometimes violent clashes over what they see as China’s tightening grip. Most protesters in the former British colony want greater democracy, among other demands, although a small minority is calling for independence.  In that sense, they share some common ground with separatist demonstrators in Spain’s wealthy northeast region of Catalonia, which was rocked by protests after nine separatist leaders were sentenced this month to long prison terms for a failed independence bid in 2017.  Thursday’s rally in Hong Kong was held in a downtown garden, home to a cricket club in colonial days, one of the few to have obtained a permit from authorities in recent weeks. The organizers said 3,000 protesters took part. Police put the number at 550.   Some Hong Kong protesters went online to urge people not to attend, saying it was too provocative and risked denting international support for their own cause.  There was a small demonstration on Thursday in solidarity with the Hong Kong protesters outside the Chinese Consulate-General in Barcelona, which La Vanguardia newspaper said attracted more than 100 people.   Most banners at the Hong Kong rally called for Catalan freedom or denounced perceived police brutality in clashes with Hong Kong protesters over five months of unrest. But there were a couple of large flags calling for Hong Kong’s independence and a brief, muted chant along the same lines. That is a red line for the Communist Party rulers in Beijing.  Hong Kong authorities formally banned a group promoting independence from China in September last year, the first time  a political organization has been outlawed since the 1997 handover to Chinese rule.  In Spain, all but one of the main political parties have consistently opposed an independence referendum for Catalonia, but separatist parties are not banned and the region already enjoys a degree of political autonomy and control over part of its budget.  Ricard Bosom, 36, a tourist from Barcelona, said he supported the Hong Kong protesters.  “The context (of Catalonia and Hong Kong) is different,” he told Reuters. “Both are different stories, but in general terms... it is about an oppressive and tyrannical state against a group of people that are trying to do something different and they are not listened to.”  In 1997 Hong Kong was allowed to retain extensive freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China under a “one country, two systems” formula, including an independent judiciary and right to protest.  But many Hong Kong residents are angry at what they see as a relentless march toward mainland control.  “I come because I think Catalonia needs support, just like Hong Kong,” said Jason Chan, 22, a clerk. “Pursuing democracy is a universal value.”  China denies meddling in Hong Kong and accuses the United States and Britain of fomenting the unrest, the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.  He warned this month that any attempt to divide China would end in “crushed bodies and shattered bones”.  Independence is a highly divisive issue in Catalonia, a region of more than 7 million inhabitants that has its own language, parliament and flag.  Protests erupted in the region after the separatist leaders were sentenced on Oct. 14 over the 2017 independence bid, which included holding a referendum that had been banned by the courts and then making a unilateral declaration of independence.  Students have boycotted classes and protesters have focused on strategic targets to cause maximum disruption, including the airport serving Barcelona - similar to strategies used by Hong Kong activists.

In a major policy speech on China that touched on an array of disputes ahead of talks with Beijing to ease a trade war, Pence said the United States does not seek confrontation or to “de-couple” from its main economic rival.  But he pulled no punches when addressing some of the political rifts between the two countries.  Criticizing China’s construction of a “surveillance state,” and “increasingly provocative” military action, Pence held up Taiwan’s Democracy as a better path for Chinese people and took Beijing to task for its handling of pro-democracy protests that have rocked Hong Kong for more than four months.  “Hong Kong is a living example of what can happen when China embraces liberty,” he said. “And yet, for the last few years, Beijing has increased its interventions in Hong Kong and engaged in actions that curtail the rights and liberties that Hong Kong’s people were guaranteed through a binding international agreement.”  He said the United States stands with the protesters in Hong Kong, millions of whom have taken to the streets in sometimes violent clashes over what they see as China’s tightening grip.   “We stand with you, we are inspired by you. We urge you to stay on the path of non-violent protest,” Pence said in his address at a Washington think tank.              He also slammed China for its treatment of Muslim Uighurs in the Xinjiang region.   Pence directed some of his harshest words at sports apparel giant Nike (NKE.N) and the NBA, which he accused of siding with China’s Communist Party over freedom of speech in Hong Kong.  The vice president, who is often the face of the Trump administration’s tougher policies on China, said the NBA and Nike had failed to defend basketball team Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, after he tweeted support of Hong Kong protesters earlier this month.       “Some of the NBA’s biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of other peoples,” he said.   By “siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime,” Pence said.   Nike stores in China removed Rockets merchandise after Beijing criticized Morey, Pence noted.   “Nike promotes itself as a so-called social-justice champion, but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door,” he said.   Pence said “far too many American multinational corporations have kowtowed to the lure of China’s money and markets by muzzling not only criticism of the Chinese Communist Party, but even affirmative expressions of American values.”   Nike, the NBA and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the remarks.  Influential Chinese state-backed newspaper the Global Times, however, said in an editorial that while Pence reiterated many of his previous criticisms, there was still “room for optimism.”  “He emphasized the U.S. does not want to ‘decouple’ and repeated how U.S. President Donald Trump is willing to start a new future with China,” it said.  The closely watched speech set a discordant tone just weeks before a summit in Chile where U.S. President Donald Trump hopes to finalize a partial trade deal with China’s Xi Jinping.   The S&P 500 U.S. stock index briefly moved lower after his comments.  Analysts said Pence’s speech appeared aimed at keeping the way open for a trade deal while seeking to convince Trump’s support base that he was tough on China going into the 2020 election.  Douglas Paal, a China expert with Washington’s Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, called it “a superficial and political speech, not a guiding strategic document.”  Scott Kennedy, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, saw it as an bid to provide rationale for “policy moves on security, economics and politics which originally were much less coordinated and less integrated.”    A new round of talks between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese officials to try to end the bruising trade dispute is set for Friday.  The United States launched a trade war with China 15 months ago, alleging unfair trading practices such as theft of U.S. intellectual property and generous industrial subsidies at the expense of foreign competitors.      Fears of antagonizing Beijing had prompted the White House to postpone Pence’s speech, which was originally scheduled for June, ahead of a meeting Trump and Xi aimed at getting trade talks back on track.   Many China watchers had expected Pence to tread lightly on sensitive topics on Thursday, in sharp contrast to the bombastic tone of his first major China policy address a year ago. But some saw signs of a rapprochement as well.   “In contrast to the Hudson Institute speech of October 2018, the Vice President’s equally hard-hitting Wilson speech offered the beginnings of a positive vision for U.S.-China relations,” said Robert Daly of the Kissinger Institute on China.

However, the social media platform did record another rise in daily users who see ads on the site, beating analyst estimates.  Twitter’s Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said the growth in monetizable daily active usage (mDAU) was driven by product improvements, including making the site easier to navigate and more proactively identifying abusive content for removal.  Twitter’s revenue rose 9% from a year earlier to $824 million, missing Wall Street expectations of $874 million, based on IBES data from Refinitiv. Total advertising revenue was $702 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year.  Third-quarter net income was $37 million, or $0.05 per share. In the same period last year, the firm reported net income of $789 million, or $106 million when adjusted to exclude certain items.  Analysts had expected net income of $161.5 million.  Twitter had forecast that third quarter revenue growth would lag the first two quarters, partly due to ending some older ad formats. But it also encountered unexpected problems, such as bugs which impacted its ability to target ads and share data with ad partners, and fewer big events compared with the previous summer.  For the fourth quarter, Twitter expects total revenue to be between $940 million and $1.01 billion. Wall Street on average expects $1.06 billion.  Twitter has stopped disclosing its monthly active users count, instead reporting mDAU, a metric it created to measure users exposed on a daily basis to advertising through the site or Twitter applications that are able to show ads.  The company’s average mDAU hit 145 million, beating analyst expectations of 141 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. This alternative metric was up 17% year-over-year.  In July, Twitter launched a more personalized desktop Twitter.com as part of its efforts to make the platform better for conversations. It has also experimented with the ability to follow topics, and has recently expanded testing for a feature to hide replies.  Recently, the company made 6-second video bidding available for global advertisers and it has continued to expand its live and on-demand video partnerships, including deals with NBC Olympics and Eurosport for coverage of the 2020 Tokyo Games.  Twitter and other social media platforms have also recently come under scrutiny over their ad policies.  Twitter, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google were this month criticized by U.S. democratic presidential candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, for allowing politicians to run ads containing false or misleading claims.  In August, Twitter announced it would no longer accept advertising from state-controlled news media outlets, shortly after it came under fire for showing ads from Chinese state-controlled media that criticized the Hong Kong protesters.  Twitter also faced heat over its handling of user data when it said in October that email addresses and phone numbers uploaded by users to meet its security requirements may have been ‘inadvertently’ used for advertising purposes.  Total operating expenses, including cost of revenue, rose by 17% year-over-year to $780 million, partly due to plans to hire more employees.  The company expects fourth-quarter operating income to be between $130 million and $170 million. 	Reuters

Spot gold fell 0.2% to $1,488.58 per ounce as of 0725 GMT. U.S. gold futures lost 0.3% at $1,491.30 per ounce.  With EU members delaying their decision on whether to give Britain a three-month Brexit extension, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said if the deadline was deferred until the end of January he would call an election by Christmas.  “Even if Brexit goes through, there are enough geopolitical uncertainties to keep gold supported for the next two to three years,” said Hareesh V, head of commodity research at Geojit Financial Services.  “The dollar (index) has corrected from the 99.5 level to 97.2 on a continuous basis for the last two weeks. That is providing some support to prices,” he said.  The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies, was down 0.1% at 97.396, on track for its second straight session of losses.  Markets have been volatile for months due to geopolitical uncertainties such as the U.S.-China trade war, Brexit, Hong Kong protests and tensions in the Middle East.  Non-yielding bullion is often seen as a safer investment during political and financial turmoil.  OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley pointed to a lot of stale long positions and said a breakdown through $1,460.00 was likely to prompt more long-term holders to unwind positions to lock in profit.  Market participants await European and U.S. manufacturing data due on Thursday to gauge the health of the global economy, and a European Central Bank meeting, with no policy change expected at President Mario Draghi’s last at the helm.  Investors also await the U.S. Federal Reserve’s meeting on Oct. 29 and 30, at which it is expected to cut its benchmark interest rate.  Asian shares pulled ahead as corporate earnings and a ceasefire in northern Syria helped lift sentiment, though the U.S.-China trade spat and Brexit prevented a decisive shift towards riskier assets.  SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.13% to 918.48 tonnes on Wednesday from 919.66 tonnes on Tuesday. 	Reuters

The protests in Catalonia share some noticeable comparisons with the demonstrations in Hong Kong, where millions have taken to the streets for five months to vent their anger over what they see as Beijing’s tightening grip on the city.  Most protesters in Hong Kong want greater democracy, among other demands, although a small minority are calling for independence, a red line for Communist Party leaders in Beijing.  Independence is also a highly divisive issue in Catalonia, which, like Hong Kong, has more than 7 million inhabitants, its own language, parliament and flag.  Some demonstrators waved the Catalonian flag at a protest in Hong Kong on Sunday, while activists in Spain’s northeastern region have adopted some of the tactics used by people in the Chinese-ruled city.  Students in Catalonia have boycotted classes, while protesters there have focused on strategic targets to cause maximum disruption, including the international airport serving Barcelona - similar to strategies used by Hong Kong activists.  Catalonian demonstrators are angry at what they see as attempts to thwart their desire for greater autonomy from the rest of Spain, fears that resonate with many protesters in the former British colony of Hong Kong.  Some Hong Kong protesters are going online ahead of the demonstration to urge people not to attend, saying it is too provocative and risks denting international support for their cause.  Hong Kong authorities formally banned a group promoting independence from China in September last year, the first outlawing of a political organisation since the handover.  Under the terms of the 1997 handover from Britain, Hong Kong was allowed to retain extensive freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China under a “one country, two systems” formula, including an independent judiciary and right to protest.

Last week, the streets of the Chilean capital Santiago descended into chaos, as demonstrators enraged by a hike in public transport fares looted stores, set a bus alight and prompted the president to declare a state of emergency.  Earlier this month, Ecuador’s leader did the same after violent unrest triggered by the decision to end fuel subsidies that had been in place for decades.  And that was just South America.  Hong Kong has been in turmoil for months, Lebanon’s capital Beirut was at a standstill, parts of Barcelona resembled a battlefield last week and tens of thousands of Britons marched through London at the weekend over Brexit.  Protests have flared around the world in the last few months. Each has had its own trigger, but many of the underlying frustrations are similar.   Globalization and technological progress have, in general, exacerbated disparities within countries, said Sergei Guriev, former chief economist of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, while noting that not all of the current protests were driven by economic concerns.  Digital media has also made people more acutely aware of global inequalities, said Simon French, chief economist at UK bank Panmure Gordon.   “We know that the economics of happiness is largely driven by a relative assessment of your position versus your benchmark,” he said, a benchmark that now stretched way beyond the local community.  In at least four countries hit by recent violent protests, the main reason for the uprising is economic.  Governments in Chile and Ecuador have incurred their people’s wrath after trying to raise fares and end fuel subsidies.  As clashes engulfed Quito, Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno reached out to indigenous leaders who had mobilized people to take to the streets.  Within minutes, chief protest organizer Jaime Vargas had rejected that outreach.  “We’re defending the people,” Vargas said in a live Facebook video from the march in Quito.  His response, visible to millions of people, underlines an added challenge authorities have when trying to quell dissent: social media has made communication between protesters easier than ever.  Tens of thousands of people have flooded Beirut in the biggest show of dissent against the establishment there in decades. People of all ages and religions joined to protest about worsening economic conditions and the perception that those in power were corrupt.  Similar factors were behind deadly civil unrest in Iraq in early October.   More than 100 people died in violent protests across a country where many Iraqis, especially young people, felt they had seen few economic benefits since Islamic State militants were defeated in 2017.  Security forces cracked down, with snipers opening fire from rooftops and the internet being shut to stem the flow of information among protesters.  Hong Kong has been battered by five months of often violent protests over fears Beijing is tightening its grip on the territory, the worst political crisis since colonial ruler Britain handed it back to China in 1997.  There have been few major rallies in recent weeks, but violence has escalated at those held, with militant activists setting metro stations ablaze and smashing up shops, often targeting Chinese banks and stores with mainland links.  Police have fired thousands of rounds of tear gas, hundreds of rubber bullets and three live rounds at brick- and petrol bomb-throwing activists.  The events in Hong Kong have drawn comparisons to Catalonia in recent days. There, too, people are angry at what they see as attempts to thwart their desire for greater autonomy from the rest of Spain, if not outright independence.  Protesters set cars on fire and threw petrol bombs at police in Barcelona, unrest sparked by the sentencing of Catalan separatist leaders who sought to declare an independent state.  Demonstrators also focused on strategic targets to cause maximum disruption, including the international airport, grounding more than 100 flights.  That came several days after similar action in Hong Kong, suggesting that protest movements are following and even copying each other on social media and the news.  “In Hong Kong they have done it well, but they are crazier,” said Giuseppe Vayreda, a 22-year-old art student at a recent Catalan separatist protest.  On Thursday, Hong Kong protesters plan a rally to show solidarity with those demonstrating in Spain.  In some cases, individuals rise to the forefront of protest movements, using social media to get their message across.  In Egypt, where demonstrations last month were relatively small yet significant in their rarity, the catalyst of dissent against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was an Egyptian posting videos from Spain.  Greta Thunberg, a Swedish teenager, inspired millions of people to march through cities around the world in September to demand that political leaders act to stop climate change.  Tens of thousands gathered in a New York park to listen to her speech.  “If you belong to that small group of people who feel threatened by us, then we have some very bad news for you,” she said. “Because this is only the beginning. Change is coming whether they like it or not.” 	Reuters

While the Raptors gifted the opening night crowd with t-shirts with a gold Raptor and replica championship rings, outside Scotiabank Arena the protesters were giving away black t-shirts with the message “The North Stand With Hong Kong” in bright yellow across the front.   The North reference was a play on the Toronto Raptors slogan “We the North” that is used to market the team.   One volunteer, wearing a black surgical mask and who did not want to be named, said the Toronto group raised close to $34,000 through a GoFundMe page to print 7,000 t-shirts.   The NBA was plunged into controversy earlier this month after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy demonstrators in a since-deleted post that included an image captioned: “Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.”   In the aftermath of Morey’s tweet, China did not broadcast or stream two preseason games that were held in the country between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets while the NBA canceled many player appearances.   Some Chinese corporate partners of the NBA have also scrapped or suspended relations with the league.  	Reuters

Morey apologized and quickly deleted his tweet, but his backing of the protests in the Chinese-ruled city angered Beijing, Chinese fans and the team’s business partners in a market worth an estimated $4 billion to the league.   “Daryl Morey was right,” O’Neal said on TNT’s Inside the NBA program in Los Angeles on the opening night of the National Basketball Association (NBA) season.  “Whenever you see something wrong going on anywhere in the world, you should have the right to say ‘That’s not right’ and that’s what he did,” he added.

We’re allowed to say what we want to say and we’re allowed to speak up about injustices and that’s just how it goes.   “And if people don’t understand that, that’s something that they have to deal with.”   O’Neal added that with rise of social media, Americans are going to “say whatever we want to say, whenever we want to say it.”   The controversy erupted when Morey sent out a tweet that included an image captioned, “Fight For Freedom.

Facebook said on Monday it would increase transparency through  measures such as showing more information about the confirmed owner of a Facebook page and more prominently labeling content that independent fact-checkers have marked as false.  The social media giant has come under fire in recent weeks over its policy of exempting ads run by politicians from fact-checking, drawing ire from Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren.   Last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the policy, saying social media had introduced transformative avenues for speech that should not be shut down.  That same day, the Biden campaign called for the removal of an ad run by a super PAC campaign group, not a politician, that it said contained false claims about the former vice president.   Katie Harbath, Facebook’s head of global elections policy, said in response that if the now inactive ad ran again, it would be sent to Facebook’s third-party fact-checkers.   On Monday, Facebook said would be putting into effect its planned ban on paid ads that tell people in the United States not to vote. Zuckerberg told reporters on a conference call that the ban on voter misinformation would also apply to ads run by politicians.  The company will start labeling state-controlled media on its page and in the site’s ad library. In a blog post, Facebook said it planned to expand this labeling to specific posts on both Facebook and Instagram early next year.  Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, the video-streaming service of Alphabet’s Google, all recently came under scrutiny after showing ads from Chinese state-controlled media that criticized Hong Kong protesters.  This month, the Senate committee investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election said that the Kremlin’s best-known propaganda arm increased its social media activity after that vote.  “The bottom line here is that elections have changed significantly since 2016 and Facebook has changed too.” Zuckerberg said on Monday.  “We face increasingly sophisticated attacks from nation states like Russia, Iran and China, but I’m confident we’re more prepared.”  Theories that China has interfered in U.S. elections are absurd and laughable, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying at a regular press briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.  If someone says China interfered in the U.S. election, they should provide proof, said Hua. China has never had any interest in interfering with other countries’ internal affairs, she said.  Moscow and Tehran have also repeatedly denied the allegations.    Facebook will introduce a new U.S. presidential candidate spend tracker to show how much they have spent on political ads as part of the company’s efforts to make its ad library easier to use, Zuckerberg said.    Facebook launched an online library of political ads in 2018, but the database has been criticized by researchers as being poorly maintained and failing to provide useful ad targeting information.    The company plans to heighten protection of the Facebook and Instagram accounts of candidates, elected officials and their teams through a program called Facebook Protect. Participants in the program will be required to turn on two-factor authentication and their accounts will be monitored for signs of hacking.  	Reuters

Hong Kong has been relatively calm for the past week, with only small, often colorful demonstrations, and Sunday’s march will test the strength of the pro-democracy campaign, which has in the past rallied millions on to the streets.  In rejecting the protesters’ request for a march permit, police said past events had been “hijacked by a group of radical protesters” who set fire to buildings, hurled petrol bombs at police, detonated a home-made bomb and wrecked infrastructure.  “While we always respect citizens’ rights to assembly and freedom of speech, we are alarmed by this epidemic that radical protesters resort to violence in expressing their opinion,”       Acting Chief Superintendent of Police Public Relations Branch, Kong Wing-cheung, said in announcing the rejection.  Thousands have defied police in the past and staged mass rallies, often peaceful at the start but becoming violent at night.  “We will not back down even after the attack on the Civil Human Rights Front convener Jimmy Sham. Our most powerful force is the unity and resistance of this civil society,” said the rights group, calling on the public to rally on Sunday.  Prominent rights activist Jimmy Sham was brutally beaten by four men wielding hammers and knives on Wednesday, a move pro-democracy lawmakers said was meant to intimidate protesters and incite violence ahead of Sunday’s planned march.  Protesters on Friday night formed a human chain wearing Jimmy Sham face masks, with a banner reading: “We are all Jimmy Sham. Je Suis Jimmy Sham.”  The human chain was planned to stretch a 40 km (25 miles) along the city’s metro, with many people wearing eccentric masks in defiance on a ban on covering faces at public rallies. Wearing a face mask at a public rally carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail.  “I am not worried about being prosecuted because I violate the anti-mask law. I think people won’t be afraid to come out on Sunday,” said Kiki, 29, wearing a pig face mask.  Hong Kong has been hit by four months of protests, driven by concerns Beijing is eroding freedoms granted when Britain handed the city back to China in 1997.  China denies the accusation, blaming foreign nations such as the United States and Britain for inciting the unrest.  The crisis in the Chinese-ruled city is the worst since the handover and poses the biggest popular challenge to China’s President Xi Jinping since he took power. Xi has warned he would crush any attempt to split China.  Riot police and protesters have fought street battles, with police firing tear gas, rubber bullets and occasionally live rounds against brick and petrol-bomb throwing activists.  Two people have been shot and wounded by police and thousands injured. Police have arrested more than 2,300 people since June.  Many Hong Kong residents are angry at what they believe is excessive force used by police, and the introduction of the face mask ban by embattled leader Carrie Lam.  The protests started over a now-withdrawn extradition bill but have evolved into calls for greater democracy. Lam has rejected some of the protesters’ other demands, including universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into police behavior.   The extradition bill would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to Communist Party-controlled courts for trial.   The case of a young Hong Kong man, Chan Tong-kai, accused of murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan last year before fleeing back to Hong Kong, was held up originally as an example of why an extradition bill was needed.  Lam’s office said on Friday Chan had written to her saying he would “surrender himself to Taiwan for his alleged involvement in the homicide case in Taiwan upon prison discharge”.  Chan is currently serving a 29-month sentence in Hong Kong for money laundering. It was not immediately clear what had prompted his letter or what plea he planned to make.  Hong Kong hub is facing its first recession as a result of the unrest, which has damaged tourism and retail.  Protesters dressed in black ninja-like outfits have torched metro stations and Chinese banks and shops they believe are linked to mainland China. Many businesses have been forced to close.  China has banned the bulk shipment to the city of black clothing and other items popularly used by Hong Kong protesters, staff at Chinese courier firms said.  Secretary for Transport and Housing, Frank Chan, said on Friday it would be weeks before the metro operated fully.  Pro-democracy candidates will stand in almost all 452 seats in Hong Kong’s upcoming local elections, encouraged by the protests, with the outcome of the November poll a barometer of support for the city’s government.

Earlier this month, Apple removed the app that helped Hong Kong protesters track police movements, saying it was used to target officers.  Apple declined to comment.  The group separately wrote Activision Blizzard Inc’s (ATVI.O) chief executive Robert Kotick, calling on him to reverse the company’s decision to ban a player who voiced support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Activision Blizzard did not immediately comment on Friday.  “You have said publicly that you want to work with China’s leaders to effect change rather than sit on the sidelines and yell at them. We, too, believe that diplomacy and trade can be democratizing forces. But when a repressive government refuses to evolve or, indeed, when it doubles down, cooperation can become complicity,” the members wrote to Cook.  Apple said on Oct. 9 that it had begun an immediate investigation after “many concerned customers in Hong Kong” contacted it about the app and the company found it had endangered law enforcement and residents.  It said the HKMap app “has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement.” Critics said Apple acted after pressure from Beijing in a commentary in the Chinese Communist Party’s official newspaper.  The lawmakers said Apple has censored at least 2,200 apps in China, citing the nonprofit group GreatFire.  Apple’s action came amid a furor surrounding the U.S. National Basketball Association after a team official tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protests, which led Chinese sponsors and partners to cut ties with the NBA.  Last week, Blizzard reduced the punishment dealt out to Chung Ng Wai, a Hong Kong-based Hearthstone esports gamer, for his public support of pro-democracy protests after its decision sparked controversy among players and the public.  Blizzard Entertainment, a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, said initially that it would suspend the player from competition for a year and strip him of prize money. 	Reuters

Hong Kong has been relatively calm for the past week, with only small, often colorful demonstrations, and Sunday’s march will test the strength of the pro-democracy campaign, which has in the past rallied millions on to the streets.  In rejecting the protesters’ request for a march permit, police said past events had been “hijacked by a group of radical protesters” who set fire to buildings, hurled petrol bombs at police, detonated a home-made bomb and wrecked infrastructure.  “While we always respect citizens’ rights to assembly and freedom of speech, we are alarmed by this epidemic that radical protesters resort to violence in expressing their opinion,”       Acting Chief Superintendent of Police Public Relations Branch, Kong Wing-cheung, said in announcing the rejection.  Thousands have defied police in the past and staged mass rallies, often peaceful at the start but becoming violent at night.  “We will not back down even after the attack on the Civil Human Rights Front convener Jimmy Sham. Our most powerful force is the unity and resistance of this civil society,” said the rights group, calling on the public to rally on Sunday.  Prominent rights activist Jimmy Sham was brutally beaten by four men wielding hammers and knives on Wednesday, a move pro-democracy lawmakers said was meant to intimidate protesters and incite violence ahead of Sunday’s planned march.  Protesters on Friday night formed a human chain wearing Jimmy Sham face masks, with a banner reading: “We are all Jimmy Sham. Je Suis Jimmy Sham.”  The human chain was planned to stretch a 40 km (25 miles) along the city’s metro, with many people wearing eccentric masks in defiance on a ban on covering faces at public rallies. Wearing a face mask at a public rally carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail.  “I am not worried about being prosecuted because I violate the anti-mask law. I think people won’t be afraid to come out on Sunday,” said Kiki, 29, wearing a pig face mask.

Facebook said it would increase transparency through measures such as showing more information about the confirmed owner of a Facebook page so users can better understand who is behind a page’s content.  The company said it would start labeling state-controlled media on its page and in the site’s ad library. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, the video-streaming service of Alphabet’s Google all recently came under scrutiny after showing ads from Chinese state-controlled media that criticized Hong Kong protesters.  Facebook also said it would start more prominently labeling content that independent fact-checkers have marked as false on the platform and on its photo-sharing site Instagram.  The social media giant has come under fire in recent weeks over its policy of exempting ads run by politicians from fact-checking, drawing ire from Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren.  Facebook said would be putting into effect its planned ban on paid ads that tell people in the United States not to vote. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told reporters on a call on Monday that the ban on voter misinformation would also apply to ads run by politicians.  Zuckerberg told reporters that Facebook would introduce a new U.S. presidential candidate spend tracker on political advertising as part of its efforts to make its ad library easier to use. 	Reuters

After two weeks of relative calm in the five-month-long crisis, the rally drew broad-based support from regular citizens including young families and the elderly.  But a more radical faction of largely young protesters later clashed with riot police.  Banks and other businesses linked to China were attacked and bonfires lit on Nathan Road, a main road running through the heart of the Kowloon peninsula. Police fired volleys of tear gas and baton charged demonstrators, and also hosed them down from water cannon.  The Civil Human Rights Front, which had failed to obtain police approval to hold the march, said about 350,000 people took part. The police gave no estimate, saying they deemed the march to be illegal.  “You can see Hong Kongers won’t easily give up their right to demonstrate. Today’s turnout is more than I expected,” said Daniel Yeung, an unemployed protester who like many others wore a mask in defiance of a ban on wearing them.  “You can see that as long as people keep coming out in large numbers we are safe and can keep fighting,” he said.  Hong Kong, an international financial center, has been battered by months of huge and often violent protests over fears that Beijing is tightening its grip on the territory, the worst political crisis since colonial ruler Britain handed it back to China in 1997.  On Sunday, massive crowds occupied thoroughfares in several districts in Kowloon and moved northwards, smashing a number of businesses linked to China including banks, a bookshop and other stores.   Protesters threw petrol bombs at the Tsim Sha Tsui police station after police inside fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators. One activist urinated onto the police gate.   Bonfires were also set as riot police with shields and batons charged at the crowds, fired multiple volleys of tear gas.  Police used water cannon trucks to disperse protesters, spraying jets of blue dye into the crowds and sending hundreds fleeing. Police have used the dye to identify protesters.  In one incident, a water cannon fired a jet toward the front gate of the Kowloon Mosque where a group of people stood. The mosque is Hong Kong’s most important Islamic place of worship.  Some worshipers interviewed by media outside the mosque afterwards called it a provocation against Islam and demanded the police apologize. Several police officers were filmed entering the building later, though the police gave no immediate response to the incident.  As riot police advanced protesters retreated readily, with some saying they wanted to avoid large numbers of arrests unlike past rallies when they stood their ground.  Along the march, protesters torched and trashed metro stations and hundreds of shops according to the police, throwing goods onto the streets. Chinese banks including ICBC and the Bank of China were torched and had glass windows smashed up. Smartphone maker Xiaomi also had one shop vandalized.  One trashed shop on Sunday had protest slogans left on its shutters saying it was attacked because it was owned by mainland Chinese mobs who had attacked innocent people.  “We never rob. We don’t forgive. We don’t forget”, said one notice.  Police said they had seized more than 40 petrol bombs. An explosive device was also detonated by police that had been rigged among broken bricks in the middle of a street.  The unrest was sparked four months ago by a bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. It has since widened into a pro-democracy movement.  The protests pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power. Beijing has denied eroding Hong Kong’s freedoms and Xi has vowed to crush any attempt to split China.  At the start of the march, banners reading “Free Hong Kong” stretched across the ground. Other posters read “HongKongers Resist”, while graffiti on one wall said “Better Dead than Red”.  “The government pretends we just want to destroy the city. We’ll be out for as long as it takes to let the world know it is them who are destroying it,” said a 24-year-old who gave his name as Ray.  Hong Kong is governed under a “one country, two systems” formula, which allows freedoms not granted on the mainland such as a free press and independent judiciary.   Protesters are angry at Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam for what they see as her failure to protect those freedoms from an encroaching Beijing, imposing colonial-era emergency powers, and allowing what they say is excessive force by police.  Lam’s annual policy speech last Wednesday did not address any of the protesters’ demands, which include universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality against protesters.  Two people have been shot and wounded by police and thousands injured since the protests escalated in June. More than 2,300 people have been arrested. 	Reuters

Police declared the march illegal on Friday, citing concerns over public safety, and a court on Saturday said the destination of the march - the main railway interchange with mainland China - could be attacked and vandalized.  Hardcore protesters have in recent weeks targeted mainland Chinese businesses, daubing them in graffiti and at times setting fires, while mainland Chinese living in Hong Kong have begun to express fears for their own safety.  “We urge the Hong Kong people to ... assemble peacefully, march peacefully, in order to show the whole world we are still eager for the five demands,” campaigner Leung Kwok-hung said on Saturday, vowing the demonstration would go ahead.  The demands include universal suffrage, an independent inquiry into police action against protesters, amnesty for those charged, and an end to describing protesters as rioters.  In the past, thousands of people have defied police and staged mass rallies without permission, often peaceful at the start but becoming violent at night. Protesters have hurled bricks and petrol bombs at police, who have responded with baton charges and volleys of tear gas on city streets.  Hong Kong’s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has rejected the demands and on Saturday backed the use of force by police against protesters, amid criticism of heavy-handed tactics.  More than 90% of a 3,200-strong alumni at Hong Kong University on Saturday passed a motion calling for Lam’s resignation, saying students had suffered “injuries from police brutality” while in custody.  Hong Kong has been relatively calm in the past two weeks after violent protests ignited by the introduction of colonial-era emergency laws.  A prayer sit-in was scheduled downtown on Saturday evening, while demonstrations on Friday were calm, with protesters forming a human chain along the metro network and many donning masks in defiance of a ban on covering faces at public rallies.      Protesters are concerned that Beijing is eroding freedoms granted when Britain handed the city back to China in 1997.

Hong Kong’s metro, which daily moves an estimated 5 million people, has been struggling to return to normal services after being targeted by hardcore protesters, with stations set on fire and ticketing machines damaged.  Many protesters believe the metro has been closing stations to hinder their movement.  Hong Kong’s subway operator, MTR Corp Ltd said on Saturday that some services will not stop at Kowloon station, which is on the route of Sunday’s march, and will again close the network early. Kowloon district has seen some of the worst violence in recent weeks.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city’s de-facto central bank, said on Saturday that some cash machines will be out of service temporarily, owing to vandalism or to safety considerations.  Gambling authorities in the city, where horse-racing is a passion, have also said some betting shops will close on Sunday.  	Reuters

The hotel industry in general is feeling the impact of slowing global growth, which is denting business travel. Rival Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) warned that lagging growth in China and the China-U.S. trade war would hurt revenue. Raffles owner AccorHotels (ACCP.PA) narrowed its full-year profit guidance, citing uncertainty on China-related issues.  Four months of protests in Hong Kong have taken a toll on tourism, while weak economic data from China has been discouraging.  IHG reported a 6.1% fall in revenue per available room (RevPAR) in Greater China during the quarter, with a 36% drop in Hong Kong. (reut.rs/35Lf0Jl)   “While we are certainly not at the stage where business travel has been scaled back on a large scale, the cracks are certainly showing,” AJ Bell’s Investment Director Russ Mould said.  Shares in IHG, which has nearly 5,800 hotels including the Crowne Plaza and Regent Hotels & Resorts brands, fell nearly 2% in early trade on Friday.   The company has been putting more money into China, its  fastest-growing market, using new loyalty programs, digital payment options and revamping rooms at Holiday Inn to woo local business travelers. Of the 13,000 rooms IHG opened across its brands in the quarter, 4,100 were in China.  But Chief Financial Officer Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson said the company was seeing more leisure than business travelers, who tend to spend less money on bookings.  Edgecliffe-Johnson said the company had also seen some pressure in the United States as U.S. manufacturing businesses cut spending on conference halls bookings during the third quarter.  	Reuters

Customer services staff at some of China’s major couriers, including STO Express, ZTO Express and YTO Express, told Reuters that such restrictions were put in place around August.  One staff member from STO said that single pieces of black clothing could be sent, but shipments of more than five pieces would be stopped. They were also not allowed to ship masks, bulk orders of umbrellas or sticks.  “Any items that can be used by mobs,” he said.  ZTO and YTO declined to comment, while STO Express said that it abided by China’s laws and regulations.  China’s General Administration of Customs, which manages the country’s imports and exports of goods, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Black clothing and masks have been regularly worn by participants in the past four months of anti-government and anti-China protests in Hong Kong, which have seen police arrest more than 2,300 people since June. Thousands have been wounded, including two shot with live rounds.  The protesters are angry at what they see as Beijing’s tightening grip on Hong Kong, which was guaranteed 50 years of freedoms not extended to the mainland under a “one country, two systems” formula when Britain returned the city to China in 1997.  Beijing rejects the charge and accuses Western countries, especially the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble. The unrest poses the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. He has warned that any attempt to divide China would be crushed.  The shipping restrictions appear to be having little impact on the ground in Hong Kong, however, sales representatives at retailers such as Uniqlo, H&M and Giordano Ladies at a local mall told Reuters.  Most said they had not heard of a ban on black clothing, and all said they had not received any corporate directives related to the ban, but also that they had not noticed an increase in the sale of black clothing recently.

The hotel industry in general is feeling the impact of slowing global growth, which is denting business travel. Rival Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) warned that lagging growth in China and the China-U.S. trade war would hurt revenue. Raffles owner AccorHotels (ACCP.PA) narrowed its full-year profit guidance, citing uncertainty on China-related issues.  Four months of protests in Hong Kong have taken a toll on tourism, while weak economic data from China has been discouraging.  IHG reported a 6.1% fall in revenue per available room (RevPAR) in Greater China during the quarter, with a 36% drop in Hong Kong. (reut.rs/35Lf0Jl)   “While we are certainly not at the stage where business travel has been scaled back on a large scale, the cracks are certainly showing,” AJ Bell’s Investment Director Russ Mould said.  Shares in IHG, which has nearly 5,800 hotels including the Crowne Plaza and Regent Hotels & Resorts brands, fell nearly 2% in early trade on Friday.   The company has been putting more money into China, its  fastest-growing market, using new loyalty programs, digital payment options and revamping rooms at Holiday Inn to woo local business travelers. Of the 13,000 rooms IHG opened across its brands in the quarter, 4,100 were in China.  But Chief Financial Officer Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson said the company was seeing more leisure than business travelers, who tend to spend less money on bookings.  Edgecliffe-Johnson said the company had also seen some pressure in the United States as U.S. manufacturing businesses cut spending on conference halls bookings during the third quarter.  	Reuters

The airline, the biggest corporate casualty of widespread anti-government protests in the Asian financial hub, on Friday lowered its second-half profit expectations, citing “incredibly challenging” conditions in its home market.  Cathay had started meeting investors in Hong Kong and Singapore on Sept. 24 after it mandated four banks to explore carrying out a U.S. dollar denominated bond, according to a term sheet issued at the time, seen by Reuters.  It would have been the first U.S. dollar debt deal for Cathay since 1996 and had been touted as a landmark transaction for the airline given all of its debt is denominated in Hong Kong dollars.  The issuance was to be unrated, and two sources with knowledge of the matter said that Cathay was willing to pay 200 basis points over the U.S. Treasuries rate to secure three-year or five-year funding, with the size and term of the placement dependent on demand.   However, investors demanded a higher price of at least 300 basis points over U.S. Treasuries, which made the deal more expensive for Cathay, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.  Cathay’s term sheet had said the transaction would be reliant on market conditions.   A Cathay spokesman on Friday said the Hong Kong dollar private placement market was providing more funding opportunities and a debt issuance in that market was completed last month.  “We will continue to monitor the U.S. dollar bond market in future,” he said in a statement.  Dealogic data showed that Cathay raised $102 million in October and $64 million in May through Hong Kong dollar denominated deals.   The airline has only carried out 12 bond transactions in the past decade and all were priced in Hong Kong dollars.   Cathay had mandated Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank and HSBC to work on the shelved U.S. dollar bond deal. 	Reuters

The airline reported a 7.1% drop in passenger numbers for the month of September as travelers avoided Hong Kong due to widespread and sometimes violent protests, and said its second-half financial results were likely to be below the first half.  Cathay, which is trying to complete a three-year financial turnaround plan, has become the biggest corporate casualty of the Hong Kong protests after China demanded it suspend staff involved in, or supporting, the demonstrations that have plunged the former British colony into a political crisis.  The airline in August reported a HK$1.347 billion ($171.75 million) first-half profit. At that time, Cathay said second-half profit was likely to be higher than the first-half, as is typically the case for the airline, based on seasonality.  The consensus estimate before Friday’s update was for the airline to report a full-year profit of HK$3.2 billion, according to 11 analysts polled by Refinitiv, although some last month predicted a poor second half.  Cathay shares were trading 1.4% lower at 0510 GMT.  “We continue to see a significant shortfall in inbound bookings for the remainder of 2019 as compared to the same snapshot last year,” Cathay Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam said in a statement on Friday.  Cathay last month said it would cut capacity for the upcoming winter season.  BOCOM International analyst Luya You on Friday said further cuts might be needed in 2020 and even 2021 given there was no way of determining a timeline for when the political turmoil in Hong Kong would be resolved.  Inbound traffic to Hong Kong was down 38% in September, unchanged from August, with demand from the mainland Chinese market hit especially hard, the airline said.  The 7.1% fall in passenger numbers in September was better than the 11.3% drop in August, but Cathay said an increasing reliance on transit passengers had affected its yields - a measure of the average fare paid per kilometer per passenger.  BOCOM’s You said even if passenger numbers outside China appeared to stabilize in the coming months, that was likely to come at the cost of significantly lower fares.  Cathay also said cargo volumes fell 4.4% in September, but that there were signs of improvement as it headed into air freight’s traditional high-demand season. 	Reuters

In the strongest remarks yet by the ethnically-Chinese-majority Southeast Asian country which has close relations with China, Lee said the demands did not provide a way out of often-violent unrest which has gripped Hong Kong for months.   His comments came after Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam had to abandon a policy speech on Wednesday after she was jeered by pro-democracy lawmakers.  “The demonstrators say they have five major demands and not one can be compromised but those are not demands which are meant to be a program to solve Hong Kong’s problems. Those are demands which are intended to humiliate and bring down the government,” Lee said at a business conference in Singapore.  The demands include full democracy and an independent inquiry into what they say has been excessive force by police in dealing with the unrest.  “There is no simple solution ... to say we want universal suffrage, but Hong Kong is not a country, it is a special administrative region,” Lee added.   Lee said there could be some legislative reform or social policies that could help restore order but that it would not be easy.  He said the unrest was causing ructions across the region.  “When Hong Kong is troubled, when there are demonstrations or worse riots, when the chief executive is booed out of the Legislative Council chamber, I think that is very sad for Hong Kong and bad for the region,” Lee said. “We look on with concern.”  Singapore, a rival financial center to Hong Kong, has been seen as a potential beneficiary if business and money move due to the protests, however Singapore lawmakers have been at pains to play down any positive gains.  The Hong Kong protesters are angry at what they see as Beijing’s tightening grip on Hong Kong, which was guaranteed 50 years of freedoms under the “one country, two systems” when Britain returned the city to China in 1997.  In her news conference, Lam rejected two of the protesters’ five demands - amnesty for those charged and universal suffrage - saying the first was illegal and the second beyond the chief executive’s power.

PNC Financial Services Group Inc and Bank of New York Mellon Corp also rose after better-than-expected earnings.  The reports followed robust results on Tuesday from JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc, showing consumer confidence remained strong despite recession fears that have led businesses to pull back on spending and borrowing.  “We had a pretty good celebration yesterday after the first busy day of earnings and we got another busy day today, so I think that the path of least resistance is a little bit lower today,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.

In response, China warned that bilateral relations would be damaged if the measures became law.  Conflicting reports on an orderly exit for Britain from the European Union also added to the mix.

European stocks were on track to open lower after big gains the previous day, with pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 futures down 0.19%, German DAX futures shedding 0.25% and FTSE futures losing 0.39%.  U.S. S&P500 futures fell 0.3% also on rising caution over U.S-China trade deal after China lambasted new legislation taking a hard line on China.  U.S. and European shares had jumped on Tuesday as officials and diplomats involved in Britain’s negotiations with the EU said differences between the two sides had been narrowed significantly.  As last-ditch talks continued well beyond midnight, caution set in among investors, and the British pound slipped back to $1.2752, dropping 0.3%, having shot up to $1.28 on Tuesday, a level unseen since May 21.  The pound had strengthened nearly 5% over the past week as investors rushed to reprice the prospect of a last-minute Brexit deal before the end-October deadline.  The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michael Barnier had been demanding a legal text of any agreement by midnight U.K. time. However, the talks between Britain’s Brexit negotiator David Frost and the EU’s executive European Commission went well past midnight in Brussels, and were set to resume on Wednesday.  The EU will determine whether a deal is fit to be put to Thursday’s leaders’ summit for consideration, but even then there is a question whether Britain’s minority government could win approval for any deal from the country’s divided parliament.  “Watching the UK news channels last night, the arithmetic for achieving said approval is challenging to say the least,” analysts at National Australia Bank wrote in a note.  Many Asian share markets still held some gains in the wake of Tuesday gains by U.S. and European equities.  MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.4% while Japan’s Nikkei jumped 1.5%, hitting 10-month highs.  South Korea’s KOSPI index climbed 0.6%, encouraged by South Korea’s central bank cutting its policy interest rate for the second time in three months.  Stronger-than-expected earnings from major U.S. banks JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo also boosted equities even as the International Monetary Fund downgraded its 2019 global growth forecast for a fifth time.  Indeed, news on the U.S.-China trade front has been less encouraging.

China’s relationship with the United States will be damaged should the legislation become law, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement.  The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, one of the measures passed by the House, would require the U.S. secretary of state to certify each year that Hong Kong retained its autonomy in order to receive special treatment as a major financial center.

Officials and diplomats involved in negotiations over the acrimonious divorce between the world’s fifth-largest economy and its biggest trading bloc said that differences over the terms of the split had narrowed significantly.  The news lit a fire under European and U.S. equities, which jumped about 1% on Tuesday. The British pound rocketed to $1.28, a level not seen since May 21.  The pound has strengthened nearly 5% over the past week as investors rushed to reprice the prospect of a last-minute Brexit deal before the end-October deadline.  Still, the pound lost steam in Asia, falling 0.3% to $1.2752, as uncertainties remained on whether a deal will be sealed at a make-or-break EU summit on Thursday and Friday and if Britain’s minority government can get it through a divided UK parliament.  MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.4% while Japan’s Nikkei jumped 1.5%, hitting 10-month highs.  Australian shares added 0.9% while South Korea’s KOSPI index climbed 0.6%, maintaining gains after South Korea’s central bank cut its policy interest rate for the second time in three months, matching a record low to address mounting deflationary pressures.  Stronger-than-expected earnings from major U.S. banks JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo also boosted equities even as the International Monetary Fund downgraded its 2019 global growth forecast for a fifth time.  “Equities rallied everywhere supported by another set of Brexit headlines and as earnings season started in the United States,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a client note.  “Officials cautioned that talks haven’t finished yet and there could yet be problems in hitting the deadline of midnight Tuesday,” they added.  The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michael Barnier had been demanding a legal text of any agreement by midnight U.K. time. However, the talks were still going on between UK Brexit negotiator David Frost and the EU’s executive European Commission past midnight in Brussels.  The EU will determine whether a deal is fit to be put to Thursday’s leaders’ summit for consideration.  “Watching the UK news channels last night, the arithmetic for achieving said approval is challenging to say the least,” analysts at National Australia Bank wrote in a note.  Elsewhere, news on the U.S.-China trade front has been less encouraging.  Bloomberg reported, citing sources, that China will struggle to buy $50 billion of U.S. farm goods annually unless it removes retaliatory tariffs on American products, which would require reciprocal action by U.S. President Donald Trump.  China also said Beijing resolutely opposed new measures passed by the U.S. House of Representatives related to the Hong Kong protests and urged lawmakers to stop interfering.  The news helped to lift the Japanese yen from a 2-1/2 month low against the greenback hit on Tuesday.  The yen stood at 108.69 per dollar, compared to Tuesday’s low of 108.90.  “There remain concerns over whether everything goes all right until the APEC meeting in November when they are expected to sign a deal. I got the impression that the market got a bit too optimistic,” said Naoya Oshikubo, senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset in Tokyo.  The dollar itself was under pressure against a basket of six major currencies with its index hovering near three-week lows at 98.338. The euro was little changed at $1.1028.  In commodities, Brent crude added 10 cents to $58.84 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 10 cents to $52.91 after falling the previous session over fears the unrelenting U.S.-China trade war would keep squeezing the global economy.

Randall Schriver, the assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, said the United States was “100 percent” behind those in Hong Kong who were speaking out for respect for fundamental rights guaranteed in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration.  “Certainly we have some concern about some of the tactics that the protesters have been using and may use, and I think in single instances where that becomes a real problem we would point that out,” he told a conference organized by the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington-based research institute.  “But I think in general, we are concerned about the heavier hand that Beijing has taken and the Hong Kong authorities have  taken with what we regard as legitimate activities on the part of the people of Hong Kong,” Schriver added.  He said the Hong Kong police and authorities had historically acted to uphold the law and the territory had a very good judicial system.  “What we are concerned about is the heavier hand from Beijing and how that can be distorted and turned into something more repressive,” Schriver said  “The general trend is concerning, that we’re seeing less autonomy, more influence from Beijing, heavier hand from the authorities there, and in general an erosion of the things that were promised the people of Hong Kong.”  Hong Kong has been rocked by four months of unrest, with massive marches and at times violent protests involving tear gas, petrol bombs and live rounds, over concerns Beijing is tightening its grip on the city and eroding democratic rights.  Earlier on Tuesday, embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam ruled out making any concessions to pro-democracy protesters in the face of escalating violence, which police said was now “life threatening,” citing the detonation of a small bomb.

High street retail rents fell by 10.5% in the July-Sept quarter compared to the previous quarter, CBRE said, the sharpest quarterly decline since the first quarter of 1998 at the time of the Asian financial crisis.  Overall high street rents are likely to decline by another 5-10% over the remainder of 2019, the consultancy said.  The Hong Kong protests began in May, in opposition to a bill allowing extradition to mainland China, but have since evolved into broader calls for democracy in the former British colony, with activists throwing petrol bombs, setting street fires and trashing metro stations.  China has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong and reacted strongly to expressions of support for the protests.  The landlord of an 11,600 square foot (1,078 sq m), three-storey shop space in Causeway Bay, a prime shopping district, has slashed rent by more than 30 percent, according to realtor Midland IC&I.  The space will be leased for a monthly HK$480,000 ($61,196) to a claw crane arcade this month, down sharply from the HK$700,000 charged from the home appliance chain Fortress before that lease expired last October.  The protests have taken a heavy toll on tourism and consumer spending.  “There’s very few rental transactions; people are not making offers, they’re pessimistic about the outlook and want to observe more,” said Daniel Wong, CEO of Midland IC&I.  On the positive side, however, there have not been many lease terminations yet, he added.  A Midland survey published last month showed vacancy rates in Hong Kong’s four core shopping districts rose only slightly to 6.5% in the third quarter, up from 5.6% a year ago.  The realtor expected rents for core district street shops to decline 10%-15% in the second half, and the vacancy rate to rise to up to 8%-9% next year.  The government said last week at least 100 restaurants have closed in the past few months, and has repeatedly urged landlords and property developers to offer rent subsidies to retailers and food and beverage businesses.  MTR Corp, the subway operator which is about 75% owned by the government and itself owns some shopping centres, said it would refund rents and other charges on a pro rata basis to its tenants for the time it shut the stations or centres.  MTR together with major shopping mall developers Henderson Land and Hysan Development have offered some tenants temporary rental adjustments. Henderson and Hysan have also launched promotions to attract retail customers.  Lawrence Wan, senior director of CBRE Hong Kong retail advisory & transaction services, said some retailers have negotiated with landlords to restructure their lease. That would allow them to pay lower rent for two to three months, and then settle the difference when the business environment stabilises.  Some also looked for short-term leases of three to six months and put expansion plans on hold.  “We have got more clients asking about short-term leases. People want to see if they could get more business in the festive season,” Wan said, citing fashion outlets hoping to clear in-season stock during Christmas and Chinese New Year. 	Reuters

They chanted “Fight for Freedom, Fight for Hong Kong” as they gathered peacefully near central government offices in the Admiralty district of the Chinese-ruled city only hours after police said violent protests had escalated to a “life-threatening level”.  A small bomb exploded and a policeman was stabbed on Sunday night, the latest violence in four months of unrest in which police have responded to petrol bombs and rocks with tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannon and sometimes live rounds.  Emergency laws introduced on Oct. 5 banning face masks at  rallies and carrying a maximum penalty of one year in jail sparked some of the worst violence since the unrest started.  On Monday night, many protesters wore face masks in defiance of the ban.  Speakers urged the United States to pass a Hong Kong human rights act to ensure democracy for the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  “Make Hong Kong Great Again”, read one poster. Some protesters waved the U.S. flag and carried “Uncle Sam” recruitment posters reading “Fight for Freedom, Stand with HK”.  “All of the Hong Kong people feel hopeless and the government hasn’t listened to our voices so we need the USA to help us,” said protester Edward Fong, 28.  The protesters are angry at what they see as Beijing’s tightening grip on the city which was guaranteed 50 years of freedoms under the “one country, two systems” formula under which it returned to China. Beijing rejects the charge and accuses Western countries, especially the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.  The unrest poses the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. He warned that any attempt to divide China would be crushed.  “Anyone attempting to split China in any part of the country will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones,” Xi said in a meeting on Sunday with leaders in Nepal, where he was visiting, according to China’s state broadcaster CCTV.  In contrast to Monday night’s peaceful protest, rallies descended into chaos on Sunday with running skirmishes between protesters and police in shopping malls and on the streets.   Black-clad activists threw 20 petrol bombs at one police station, while others trashed shops and metro stations.  A crude explosive device, which police said was similar to those used in “terrorist attacks”, was remotely detonated as a police car drove past and officers were clearing roadblocks on Sunday night.  A police officer also had his neck slashed by a protester.  “Violence against police has reached a life-threatening level,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police Tang Ping-keung.  “They are not protesters, they are rioters and criminals. Whatever cause they are fighting for it never justifies such violence.”  Protests have attracted millions of people but have gradually become smaller in recent weeks. Yet violence by hardcore activists has risen, prompting debate over tactics. But they say they remained united.  “Violence is always undesirable, but in the case of Hong Kong, we have no other option,” said regular protester Jackson Chan, 21.  “In June, 2 million took to the street and demonstrated peacefully, yet the government showed a complete disregard to the public opinion... Escalation of violence is inevitable,” Chan said.  On Monday, speakers called on U.S. senators to vote for the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, saying it would be their “most powerful weapon”.  The bill supports human rights in Hong Kong with measures under consideration such as annual reviews of its special economic status and sanctions on those who undermine its autonomy. The text will not be finalised until it passes both houses of Congress and is signed by the president.  “We are exhausted and scared, many of us have been detained and tortured... We believe international help will come one day,” said one speaker.  Police have fired thousands of rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets at brick- and petrol bomb-throwing protesters and arrested more than 2,300 people since June, many teenagers. Two people have been shot and wounded.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam is due to deliver her annual Policy Address on Wednesday amid pressure to restore confidence in the government.  Hong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade because of the protests, with tourism and retail hardest hit. 	Reuters

Blizzard Entertainment, a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard which is partly backed by Chinese gaming giant Tencent Holdings, said last week that it would suspend the player Chung “blitzchung” Ng Wai from competition for a year and strip him of prize money after he called for the liberation of Hong Kong in a post-game interview.  Blizzard became the latest corporate name to get caught up in tensions relating to the Hong Kong protests, garnering it support in China but also drawing criticism from fans, players and commentators in the West, some of whom said that they would stop working with Blizzard as a result of its decision.  However on Saturday, Blizzard said it had decided to cut Chung’s punishment to a six-month suspension and would still award him his prize money, with its president J. Allen Brack saying the company had “reacted too quickly” in making its decision.   Brack said that Chung still had to be penalized as he had violated rules, but that his specific views were not a factor in the decision.  “I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision,” he said in a post on Blizzard’s website.   Chung said in a statement posted on Twitter that he accepted Blizzard’s decision and would express his opinions on his personal platforms in future.

Rallies in shopping malls on Hong Kong island and across the harbor in the Kowloon district began peacefully around midday with a few hundred people at each chanting “Free Hong Kong” and other slogans.  A few hours later, black-clad activists took to the streets and began trashing shops and metro stations and erecting road blocks.  Police said protesters threw bricks and petrol bombs at police, with one setting a police van alight in Kowloon’s Sha Tin district. Police made several arrests and used tear gas to disperse protesters, saying they used “minimum force”.  By Sunday night, most protesters had dispersed, but riot police remained on the streets in various districts.  The Hong Kong government said a large group of protesters threw 20 Molotov cocktail petrol bombs at Mong Kok police station in Kowloon on Sunday night. Local media said barricades outside the police station were set ablaze but police and firefighters extinguished the fires.  Television footage showed shoppers screaming and some injured when police charged inside a mall. The protesters, many wearing face masks to shield their identity, were often supported by shoppers.  In one mall, a group of riot police, shields out front and pepper spray canisters in hand, were forced to retreat by chanting shoppers until they were outside of the mall.  In another incident, a group of 50 shoppers inside a mall faced off against riot police outside, chanting “Hong Kong police mafia”. The shoppers cheered when police drove off.  Hong Kong’s police, once praised as “Asia’s finest”, have been accused of using excessive force in dealing with protesters and have lost the confidence and respect of many Hong Kongers.  “Hong Kong used to be a prosperous city and now she has become a police state. Hong Kong is my home. We should protect her. We should resist,” said a 70-year-old who gave only his last name, Hui.  He was part of a group of 60- to 70-year-olds on Nathan Road, Kowloon, who were cheering the protesters, urging them to block the road and warning them when police were returning.  Hong Kong has been rocked by four months of often huge and violent protests against what is seen as Beijing’s tightening grip on the Chinese-ruled city.  The protests were sparked by a now-abandoned extradition bill but have widened into a pro-democracy movement and an outlet for anger at social inequality in the city, which boasts some of the world’s most expensive real estate.  The unrest has plunged the city into its worst crisis since Britain handed it back to China in 1997 and poses the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.  Hong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade because of the protests, with tourism and retail hardest hit.  Hong Kong’s protests have also taken on an element of civil disobedience by residents angry at what they see as excessive force by riot police and a heavy-handed government which introduced colonial-era emergency laws to quell unrest.  Small protest rallies have included school children, office workers, shoppers and the elderly. Hardcore activists who clash with police tend to emerge later in the day.  “I think the police have been using their power to suppress the citizens,” said resident Mary Lam, 26.  “That’s why more and more young children come out and protest against the government and the police. Those being arrested don’t have human rights. This is not fair.”  The Hong Kong government introduced emergency laws to ban the wearing of face masks at public rallies, a move that sparked some of the worst violence since the unrest started in June.   Two people have been shot and wounded during protests.  Police have arrested more than 2,300 people since June. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has said that, since September, nearly 40% of those arrested were under the age of 18 and 10% under 15, without giving the total number of arrests.  Hong Kong’s MTR rail network, which usually carries some 5 million people daily, has borne the brunt of attacks, and  several stations were closed after ticketing machines and entrances were damaged.  Protesters have also targeted Chinese banks and shops with links to mainland China. A group wielding hammers damaged a Huawei store on Sunday.  Demonstrators believe China has been eroding Hong Kong’s freedoms, guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula introduced with the 1997 handover.  The now-withdrawn extradition bill, under which residents would have been sent to Communist-controlled mainland courts, was seen as the latest move to tighten control.

Xi, the first Chinese president to visit Nepal in 22 years, arrived in Nepal on Saturday on a state visit. Both sides are expected to sign a deal expanding a railway link between the Himalayan nation and Tibet.  Nepal’s Oli told Xi that the country will oppose any “anti-China activities” on its soil, CCTV reported.  China, which is trying to de-escalate a protracted trade war with the United States, has seen its political authority tested by increasingly violent protests in Hong Kong against what is seen as Beijing’s tightening grip on the Chinese-ruled city.   Police in Hong Kong have used rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons against pro-democracy demonstrators in the former British colony, which has been plunged into its worst political crisis in decades.  U.S. president Donald Trump had said it would be difficult to negotiate with China if anything “bad” happens in Chinese authorities’ handling of the Hong Kong protests.   Trump said he discussed the issue of Hong Kong with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Saturday during their latest round of talks. Both sides reached a “phase-one deal” that has raised optimism for a broader agreement although many fundamental issues remained unresolved and existing tariffs are still not lifted.  Washington last week also blacklisted 28 Chinese companies over Beijing’s treatment of predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities. China has faced growing international condemnation for what it calls re-education and training centers in the remote western region of Xinjiang. Activists say they are mass detention camps holding more than 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims.  Before arriving in Nepal, Xi was in India for talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to try to mend ties over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir amid scattered anti-China protests from Tibetan groups.  China sent troops into remote, mountainous Tibet in 1950 in what it officially terms a peaceful liberation and has ruled there with an iron fist ever since.  The Dalai Lama, Tibet’s spiritual leader, fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule. China brands him a dangerous reactionary who seeks to split off nearly a quarter of the Chinese land mass.  (The story corrects misspelling of “shattered” in headline and second paragraph).

Rallies in shopping malls on Hong Kong island and across the harbor in the Kowloon district began peacefully around midday with a few hundred people at each chanting “Free Hong Kong” and other slogans.  A few hours later, black-clad activists took to the streets and began trashing shops and metro stations and erecting road blocks.  Police said protesters threw bricks and petrol bombs at police, with one setting a police van alight in Kowloon’s Sha Tin district. Police made several arrests and used tear gas to disperse protesters, saying they used “minimum force”.  By Sunday night, most protesters had dispersed, but riot police remained on the streets in various districts.  The Hong Kong government said a large group of protesters threw 20 Molotov cocktail petrol bombs at Mong Kok police station in Kowloon on Sunday night. Local media said barricades outside the police station were set ablaze but police and firefighters extinguished the fires.  Television footage showed shoppers screaming and some injured when police charged inside a mall. The protesters, many wearing face masks to shield their identity, were often supported by shoppers.  In one mall, a group of riot police, shields out front and pepper spray canisters in hand, were forced to retreat by chanting shoppers until they were outside of the mall.  In another incident, a group of 50 shoppers inside a mall faced off against riot police outside, chanting “Hong Kong police mafia”. The shoppers cheered when police drove off.  Hong Kong’s police, once praised as “Asia’s finest”, have been accused of using excessive force in dealing with protesters and have lost the confidence and respect of many Hong Kongers.  “Hong Kong used to be a prosperous city and now she has become a police state. Hong Kong is my home. We should protect her. We should resist,” said a 70-year-old who gave only his last name, Hui.  He was part of a group of 60- to 70-year-olds on Nathan Road, Kowloon, who were cheering the protesters, urging them to block the road and warning them when police were returning.  Hong Kong has been rocked by four months of often huge and violent protests against what is seen as Beijing’s tightening grip on the Chinese-ruled city.  The protests were sparked by a now-abandoned extradition bill but have widened into a pro-democracy movement and an outlet for anger at social inequality in the city, which boasts some of the world’s most expensive real estate.  The unrest has plunged the city into its worst crisis since Britain handed it back to China in 1997 and poses the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.  Hong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade because of the protests, with tourism and retail hardest hit.  Hong Kong’s protests have also taken on an element of civil disobedience by residents angry at what they see as excessive force by riot police and a heavy-handed government which introduced colonial-era emergency laws to quell unrest.  Small protest rallies have included school children, office workers, shoppers and the elderly. Hardcore activists who clash with police tend to emerge later in the day.  “I think the police have been using their power to suppress the citizens,” said resident Mary Lam, 26.  “That’s why more and more young children come out and protest against the government and the police. Those being arrested don’t have human rights. This is not fair.”  The Hong Kong government introduced emergency laws to ban the wearing of face masks at public rallies, a move that sparked some of the worst violence since the unrest started in June.   Two people have been shot and wounded during protests.  Police have arrested more than 2,300 people since June. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has said that, since September, nearly 40% of those arrested were under the age of 18 and 10% under 15, without giving the total number of arrests.  Hong Kong’s MTR rail network, which usually carries some 5 million people daily, has borne the brunt of attacks, and  several stations were closed after ticketing machines and entrances were damaged.  Protesters have also targeted Chinese banks and shops with links to mainland China. A group wielding hammers damaged a Huawei store on Sunday.  Demonstrators believe China has been eroding Hong Kong’s freedoms, guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula introduced with the 1997 handover.  The now-withdrawn extradition bill, under which residents would have been sent to Communist-controlled mainland courts, was seen as the latest move to tighten control.  China denies the accusation and says foreign countries, including Britain and the United States, are fomenting unrest.  	Reuters

The three-metre (9-feet) statue, wearing a gas mask, helmet and protective goggles, was carried up the 500-metre (1,500-feet) peak in the dead of night by several dozen protesters, some wearing head lamps, during an overnight thunderstorm.  It held a black banner that read “Revolution of our time, Liberate Hong Kong” and could be seen from the city below.  The statue represented an injured woman protester believed by activists to have been shot in the eye by a police projectile. One of the protesters told Reuters he hoped it would inspire Hong Kong people to keep fighting.  “We are telling people that you mustn’t give up. All problems can be resolved with Hong Kong people’s persistence and hard work to reach our aims,” he said.  Hong Kong has been battered by four months of often massive and violent protests against what is seen as Beijing’s tightening grip on the Chinese-ruled city, and more protests are planned for Sunday.  Petrol bombs were thrown inside a Hong Kong metro rail station on Saturday but no one was injured, the government said.  The MTR, which usually carries some 5 million people daily, will shut early on Sunday and the Airport Express will not stop between central Hong Kong and the airport.  Metro stations have been torched and ticketing machines damaged because protesters believe MTR management, at the instruction of the government, has closed stations to hinder protesters’ movements. It was forced to shut down completely last week.  The protests started in opposition to a now-abandoned extradition bill but have widened into a pro-democracy movement and an outlet for anger at social inequality in the city, which boasts some of the world’s most expensive real estate.

China denies the accusation and says foreign countries, including Britain and the United States, are fomenting unrest.  After almost a week of relative calm, following some of the worst violence since the unrest started, hundreds of protesters wearing face masks staged a peaceful march in Kowloon on Sunday, with only a small group trashing shops and mainland China banks.  The government said petrol bombs were thrown into the entrance of the Kowloon Tong station and a Kowloon government office was set on fire.  Riot police deployed to the streets but protesters had dispersed without any major confrontation by late Sunday night.

The Kowloon Tong station was seriously damaged in the attack, the government said in a statement. Riot police deployed in the streets of Kowloon and inside several metro stations afterward.  Hundreds of protesters, many young and wearing face masks, were marching in Kowloon at the time and were headed to a district near the Kowloon Tong station.   “No crime to cover our faces, no reason to enact (anti-mask) law,” protesters chanted. “I have the right to wear masks!”  The Hong Kong government introduced colonial-era emergency laws last week to ban the wearing of face masks at public rallies, a move that sparked some of the worst violence since the unrest started in June.  Some protesters erected road barricades using public garbage bins and water-filled plastic barriers used for traffic control and security.  Protesters elsewhere set fire to a government office in Kowloon and vandalized shops and metro stations, the government said.  There were no skirmishes between protesters and police and by nightfall protesters had dispersed into small groups scattered around Kowloon.  Hong Kong’s protests started in opposition to a now-abandoned extradition bill but have mushroomed in four months into a pro-democracy movement and an outlet for anger at social inequality in the city, an Asian financial hub.

Hong Kong had experienced relative calm since last weekend, when a peaceful march by tens of thousands spiraled into a night of running battles between protesters and police.  Since then there had only been small nightly protests and activists had not flagged any major action this weekend.  A small group calling itself the “Silver-Haired Marchers” began a 48-hour sit-in at police headquarters on Saturday, describing themselves as “old but not obsolete”.  “The young people have already sacrificed a lot, it is about time for us, the senior citizens in Hong Kong to come forward to take up part of the responsibility from the young people,” 63-year-old Shiu told local media.  “I mean for us, even if we are caught by the police because of an illegal gathering, I don’t mind,” said Shiu, who was identified with only one name.  Police have arrested more than 2,300 people since June. Since September nearly 40% were under the age of 18 and 10% under 15.  Some protest marchers on Saturday covered their faces with photocopies of the Chinese president’s face, others with “V for Vendetta” Guy Fawkes masks, and a group of protesters plan a “face mask party” on Saturday night.      The face mask ban carries a maximum one-year jail term, but thousands, including school children and office workers, have defied the order.  Hong Kong’s police are also facing a crisis of confidence amid the worsening political tensions. Protesters accuse them of using excessive force, which police deny, and two protesters have been shot and wounded during skirmishes with police.  Hong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade due to the protests, with tourism and retail hardest hit.   Many shops have been shutting early to avoid becoming a target of protesters and due to closures of the damaged metro. Some stations on the network were closed on Saturday after being targeted.  Protesters have also targeted China banks and shops with perceived links to China, as well as U.S. coffee chain Starbucks (SBUX.O), which had a store in Kowloon trashed on Saturday.  	Reuters
342	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1WR0B7	October 12, 2019 /  11:04 AM / 6 months ago	HK leader ditches meeting Ted Cruz, says the U.S. senator	HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam scrapped a meeting with U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, the highest profile U.S. politician to visit the city since anti-government protests broke out more than four months ago, the senator said on Saturday.  Lam’s office had requested that the afternoon meeting be completely confidential and that Cruz refrain from speaking with the media about it, Cruz told journalists in Hong Kong.  “She seems to misunderstand how free speech operates, and also how freedom of the press operates,” said Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas and a vocal critic of China who was stopping in Hong Kong for two days as part of a regional tour.  “Ms. Lam’s cancelling the meeting is not a sign of strength. It’s a sign of weakness. It’s a sign of fear of the protesters in the streets of Hong Kong.”  Responding to a request for details about the scheduled meeting, Lam’s office said in an email: “The Chief Executive did not meet with the said U.S. Senator.”  For months Hong Kong has been paralyzed by unprecedented protests calling for democracy and against police brutality. The former British colony was returned to China in 1997 and promised broad autonomy for 50 years under a “one country, two systems” model. But many in Hong Kong accuse Beijing of eroding its freedoms.   On Saturday, demonstrators took to the streets again, and the government said petrol bombs were thrown inside a Hong Kong metro station.  “I stand with the people of Hong Kong calling on the government of China to honor the promises it made to the world when it promised to maintain political freedom in Hong Kong,” said Cruz, who wore black to show support for the black-clad protest movement.   Asked if he condemned violence that has flared during the protests, Cruz said he advocated non-violent protest with the protesters and democracy activists he had met.  Cruz said he believed Chinese President Xi Jinping was “terrified of millions of people in Hong Kong, but even more than that, millions of people in China yearning to live free”.  Those fears were “magnified on the world stage” by China’s response to a tweet by a U.S. basketball executive supporting Hong Kong’s protesters, he said.  China has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong, and Chinese state media characterized the Houston Rockets general manager’s tweet as the latest example of meddling in China’s affairs.  “Had the Chinese government simply ignored the tweet, in all likelihood virtually nobody other than die-hard Rockets fans like me would have noticed the tweet,” he said.  “But President Xi’s fear and insecurity, combined with arrogance, a belief that economic blackmail could force the NBA (National Basketball Association) to be witting participants in global censorship, ended up ironically highlighting the message far more than it ever would have otherwise.”  There is “overwhelming bipartisan support” in the U.S. Congress for the people of Hong Kong, and Cruz said he was pressing for the Senate to take up and pass the Hong Kong Human Rights Act quickly.  Asked if it was more important now than ever to pass the act, he said: “Absolutely, yes.”  The act includes measures like annual reviews of the Chinese territory’s special economic status and the imposition of sanctions on those who undermine its autonomy.  “We should continue to look for tools to stand up for human rights and for democracy and to speak clearly against repression and torture and murder,” he said.

Hong Kong’s protests started in opposition to a now-abandoned extradition bill but have mushroomed in four months into a pro-democracy movement and an outlet for anger at social inequality in the Asian financial hub.

Protesters use masks to shield their identities.  However, hundreds of people, including school children and office workers, have since defied the ban and wore face masks.

Since demonstrations escalated in mid-June, Lee, 33, has been running what he has dubbed the National Calamity Hardware Store, selling protest essentials - hard hats, gas masks and goggles - near rally hot spots.   Part-entrepreneur, part-activist, he has taken out short-term leases on storefronts in at least four districts, shifting to evade police and hostile landlords.  “I’ve never had a business like this before. It’s insane,” Lee told Reuters in his latest shop in the gritty district of Cheung Sha Wan on the Kowloon peninsula.  Hong Kong’s government invoked colonial-era emergency laws last week, including a ban on face masks, which have been widely used by protesters to hide their identities. Lee dismissed any suggestion the regulation would hurt his business, saying more protesters had come to his stall.  “The legislation of the anti-mask law only intensifies the social conflict,” he said.  “If the government can invoke emergency powers to pass certain laws or ordinances, they can use it to pass other unreasonable bills recklessly.”  Protests against a now-withdrawn extradition law that would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial, have evolved into a broader fight for greater democracy, plunging Hong Kong into its biggest political crisis in decades.  Most weekends, black-clad protesters throng the streets in demonstrations that have increasingly descended into violent clashes with police, who often fire tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds.  Protective equipment has become harder to find, since the Chinese government restricted sales and exports of safety equipment into Hong Kong. This has made Lee even more determined to keep his business going.  “Hong Kong has a free market. I am running the business without violating any law. We only announce our pop-up address one hour before we open the stall so it’s almost impossible for the police to obtain a search warrant in time,” he said.  Lee says his stall has been a constant target of the police and he has been arrested twice.  Police said in a statement to Reuters that a 33-year-old surnamed Lee, and five others, had been arrested on Sept. 30 on charges including possession of offensive weapons and inciting and taking part in unauthorized assemblies. They were released on bail.  Lee denies the charges.  He says it is a constant challenge to find new suppliers in Southeast Asia, Taiwan and the United States.  Lee’s political views go further than some other protesters opposed to what they see as the erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms by China’s Communist Party leaders. He openly backs independence for the territory, a taboo topic for Beijing.  “Independence can’t be finished within our generation. It will take a few generations,” he said.  Although Lee no longer protests on the front lines, he is sympathetic to the young activists and often offers discounts to hard-up customers.  “If we want to rebel against the authoritarian regime, we should do it without thinking about the price. At most, I will apply for bankruptcy. If we lose this fight, we will lose a few generations’ freedom,” he said.  Lee says his work keeps him busy at all hours and he snatches a few hours of sleep when he can.  “The only regret I have is that I don’t have time to spend with my seven-year-old daughter and five-year-old son,” he said.  “I hope they will understand one day that I’m fighting for their freedom.”  	Reuters

The embassy criticism, in a statement on its official Facebook page late on Thursday, came days after Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong posted a picture on social media with prominent Thai opposition politician Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit.    “Some Thai politicians have contacted the group that wants                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                to separate Hong Kong from China, showing gestures of support,” the embassy said in a Thai-language statement without naming any individuals.  “This is wrong and irresponsible. China hopes that relevant people will understand the truth about problems in Hong Kong, act carefully and do useful things for the friendship between China and Thailand.”  Hong Kong has seen months of protests led by young activists against the city’s Beijing-backed government amid fears Beijing is gradually eroding freedoms promised when the city returned to China from British rule in 1997.  China denies that and has accused Western countries of stoking anti-China sentiment in Hong Kong.  Wong and Thanathorn met on Oct. 5 at the Open Future Festival in Hong Kong, attending as speakers at the annual event.  “Under the hard-line authoritarian suppression, we stand in solidarity,” Wong wrote in a tweet that showed a picture of him standing next to the Thai politician.  Thanathorn said he was not involved with the Hong Kong protests. He also said he respected Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, and supported freedom of expression.  “I have always supported people’s rights to peaceful self-expression. I wish to see the situation in Hong Kong resolve,” Thanathorn said in a Facebook post.   Thai army chief General Apirat Kongsompong indirectly criticized Thanathorn’s meeting with Wong on Friday during a press briefing in which he accused opposition politicians of inappropriate behavior.   “Wong came to Thailand countless of times. To meet whom? The meetings had hidden agendas. Were they conspiring, cooking up something together?” Apirat asked.  “And with the incidents in Hong Kong, someone went, to give moral support, to give encouragement,” Apirat added, showing the picture of Thanathorn and Wong that was posted on social media, though Thanathorn was blacked out in the image.  Thailand was run by a military junta for five years after then-army chief General Prayuth Chan-ocha overthrew an elected government.  Elections in July were won by Prayuth’s pro-army party in a vote that opposition parties said was organized to ensure military control of politics.  The Thai Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the Chinese embassy’s statement but referred to a statement in September stating that Thailand regarded the situation in Hong Kong as China’s internal affairs.

The criticism by General Apirat Kongsompong came less than three months after direct military rule officially ended in Thailand, although the new civilian administration is led by the former army chief who overthrew the previous elected government.  Apirat described collusion between unidentified “communist” politicians and “extreme left” academics who had studied abroad, a veiled jab at members of the opposition Future Forward Party, popular with social media-savvy young people.   He said they were using social media to spread “propaganda” and brainwash and mobilize the youth, likening the situation to Hong Kong protests led by young people.   He did not identify the people he was referring to in the speech, which lasted for more than an hour, but one silhouetted picture he showed was easily recognizable as Future Forward’s charismatic leader, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit.   “Propaganda in Thailand is severe and worrying. There is a group of communists who still have ideas to overthrow the monarchy, to turn Thailand to communism,” Apirat told an auditorium of military officers, policemen and uniformed students.   The monarchy is legally above reproach in Thailand, and the new constitutional monarch who was officially crowned in May, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, has taken several steps since the death of his father to increase his authority, including taking direct control of two key army units.  Thanathorn, who has denied the military’s accusations that he is anti-monarchy, said Apirat’s attempt to link him to the Hong Kong protests was the latest attempt to instigate hatred.  “We started the Future Forward Party with good intentions for the country,” he said in a Facebook post.   “We wanted to be a part of the force pushing Thailand towards democracy, creating equality in society and leaving it a better one for the next generations.”   Last week, the military filed a sedition case against Thanathorn and others, accusing them of stirring unrest with talk of amending the 2017 constitution written by allies of the military.  It followed a public seminar they held in the Muslim-majority south, in which the first article of the constitution - stating that Thailand is one indivisible kingdom - was discussed.   “They are being shrewd, talking of amending the first article without stating directly what they want, knowing this will affect other articles about the monarchy,” Apirat said.   “This article invoked the blood our ancestors had shed to keep this land. I can tell you I will never allow it, even to my dying day,” Apirat said.  The army chief cast the military as loyal to the nation and the royal family.   “Don’t forget that Thailand is the only country in this region that has never been colonized, thanks to past kings,” Apirat said.

The teams had been scheduled to address news conferences on Friday afternoon in Shenzhen, ahead of Saturday’s exhibition game in the southern Chinese city on the border with Hong Kong that the league says will proceed as planned.    “We have decided not to hold media availability for our teams for the remainder of our trip in China. They have been placed into a complicated and unprecedented situation while abroad and we believe it would be unfair to ask them to address these matters in real time,” the league said in a statement.       No players or executives were made available for official briefings this week in China as the league grappled with the  backlash from the quickly deleted tweet by Rockets general manager Daryl Morey last weekend in support of Hong Kong anti-government protests. The China market is estimated to be worth more than $4 billion for the NBA.    China has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong, and Chinese state media has characterised Morey’s tweet as the latest example of meddling in China’s affairs. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver defended Morey’s freedom of expression in a statement issued on Tuesday, further angering Beijing.   Fan events were cancelled this week and partners have cut ties with the NBA, underscoring the severity of the situation for the league. Athletes such as Lakers star forward LeBron James and league figures have also declined to answer questions when spotted by reporters at various venues in Shanghai and Shenzhen.  The first of the two exhibition games scheduled in China took place on Thursday night, which the Nets won 114-111. It was well-attended and saw little in the way of patriotic protest. The crowd waved Chinese flags in the arena before the game started, but the packed stands gave the players a huge welcome on court and shouted enthusiastically throughout the game.  But Chinese fans who did not have a ticket could not watch: state television CCTV and Tencent, who hold the rights to show the NBA in the country, are not carrying any of the China games on their platforms.    Houston Rockets sneakers and other merchandise have been pulled from several Nike and NBA stores in major Chinese cities, with the franchise’s direct association with Morey making it a central target of the furore. Managers at some of the Nike stores said they had been instructed to remove the goods via an internal memo from management.  In a Facebook post on Sunday, Nets owner Joe Tsai, the co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, attempted to play mediator. But his post invited more controversy in the United States after he labelled protesters in Hong Kong as “separatists”.  Chen Minqi, a 20-year-old Chinese Lakers fan, said outside the hotel in Shenzhen where the Lakers were staying that Morey shouldn’t interfere in other countries’ affairs.  “Still, sport is sport and we shouldn’t punish the Lakers and the NBA for his mistake,” Chen said.

The crowd waved Chinese flags in the arena before the game started, but the packed stands gave the players a huge welcome on court and shouted enthusiastically throughout the game.  The Nets won 114-111.  The tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey supporting sometimes violent anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong sparked a furore in China，with a fan event canceled and Chinese partners cutting ties with the National Basketball Association (NBA).  The exhibition game was most notable for a facial injury to Nets guard Kyrie Irving a minute in. Irving, one of the headliners in the NBA’s promotion, was taken off immediately and did not return.  “Most people are very rational today,” one spectator said. “We all love basketball. But if NBA players or officials continue to make some of these wrong comments, we have no choice” but to protest.  Roads near the stadium were blocked off ahead of the game and those attending had to go through two rounds of security checks.  Street vendors were selling Chinese national flags outside the arena and some people had called online on those going to the game to carry flags in a show of force.  Some people protested before the game outside the stadium against Morey and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who has spoken out in support of the tweet.   “There are no Lakers or Nets fans tonight. We are all Chinese basketball fans,” one protester said.  NBA events scheduled on Tuesday and Wednesday were canceled and Chinese sponsors and partners have suspended or severed ties with the league. Sponsors’ logos were noticeable by their absence on the court.   State broadcaster CCTV and Tencent (0700.HK) did not show Thursday’s game and will not show the rematch scheduled for Saturday in Shenzhen.  The Hong Kong protests began in opposition to a bill allowing extradition to mainland China but have since evolved into broader calls for democracy, with activists throwing petrol bombs, setting street fires and trashing metro stations.  China has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong, and Chinese state media has characterized Morey’s tweet as the latest example of meddling in China’s own affairs.  The former British colony of Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula guaranteeing it wide-ranging autonomy.  The NBA’s business in China, which took years to cultivate and is estimated to be worth more than $4 billion, is under immense pressure.    The NBA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Saturday’s Lakers-Nets game would take place.  Houston Rockets sneakers and other merchandise have been pulled from several Nike (NKE.N) and NBA stores in major Chinese cities, with the franchise’s direct association with Morey making it a central target of the furore. Managers at some of the Nike stores said they had been instructed to remove the goods via an internal memo from management.   A specialist NBA store at a major shopping center in Shanghai removed all Rockets merchandise, as did the basketball-themed NBA Playzone family entertainment centres in Beijing and Shanghai.   “Rockets products were hot before and when you stepped into the store, it was full of red. Now, it is mostly yellow and blue,” the colors of the Golden State Warriors, said a manager at the Shanghai Playzone, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.  Nike and the NBA did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment.  Other major Chinese retailers, including Alibaba (BABA.N) and JD.com (JD.O), also pulled Rockets merchandise off their various platforms. Alibaba and JD.com declined to comment.  Chinese state and party-backed media continued to publish items critical of the NBA. The official English China Daily published an editorial cartoon on Thursday playing on the NBA’s official logo of an athlete dribbling a basketball. The cartoon instead put a bomb labeled “politics” in the athlete’s hand, leaving the basketball fallen by the wayside.    U.S. sports broadcaster ESPN was also criticized for its coverage of the row after using a map that appeared to endorse Beijing’s claims to both self-ruled Taiwan and disputed territories in the South China Sea.

Chief Executive Tim Cook defended the move in the face of criticism for appeasing mainland China, telling Apple workers that “this decision best protects our users.”  The move to bar the HKmap.live app, which crowdsources the locations of both police and protesters, from its app store plunges Apple into the increasingly fraught political tension between China and the protesters that has also ensnared other U.S. and Hong Kong businesses.  The company only just last week had approved the app after rejecting it earlier this month.   Alphabet Inc’s Google on Thursday said it had dropped a game from its app store that allowed players to pretend they were Hong Kong protesters, saying its policies forbid capitalizing on ongoing sensitive events.  However, Google said it had found no policy violation by HKmap.live, and confirmed that the tracking app was available on its app store.   The Chinese Communist Party’s official newspaper on Tuesday called the tracking app “poisonous” and decried what it said was Apple’s complicity in helping the Hong Kong protesters.  Apple said in a statement on Wednesday it had begun an immediate investigation after “many concerned customers in Hong Kong” contacted it about the app and Apple found it had endangered law enforcement and residents.  “The app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,” it said.  Apple did not comment beyond its statement. The company also removed BackupHK, a separate app that served as a mirror of the HKmap.live app.  Maya Wang, a senior China researcher with Human Rights Watch, said there could be legitimate concerns of misuse of apps but that the statement from Apple was “disingenuous” because it did not make any reference to pressure from Beijing in the People’s Daily commentary.   “Given the context of how (Apple) has over the years removed apps and removed access to news particularly inside mainland China that the Chinese government doesn’t want, I think that the removal of this particular app strikes me as another shameful incident in which a multinational company bends to Chinese government pressure,” she said.  Republican U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn said, “Apple and American companies should not fold to a communist regime’s demands to shut down democracy activists.”  Cook, in a letter to company workers, said it was a difficult decision.  “National and international debates will outlive us all, and, while important, they do not govern the facts,” he said. The app was being used maliciously to target individual police officers and to victimize individuals and property, and so was in violation of Hong Kong law, he said.  On Twitter, an account believed to be owned by the HKmap.live app’s developer said it disagreed with Apple’s decision and that there was no evidence to support the Hong Kong police’s claims that the app had been used in ambushes.  “The majority of user review(s) in App Store ... suggest HKmap IMPROVED public safety, not the opposite,” it said.  The app consolidates content from public posts on social networks and moderators delete content that solicits criminal activity and would ban repeated attempts to post such content in the app, it added.  Neither China’s foreign ministry nor the information office of the State Council had an immediate comment when asked about the HKmap.live app removal. Hong Kong police also had no immediate comment.  Separately, Apple removed the Quartz news app from its App Store in China because authorities said it violated local laws.  Quartz Chief Executive Zach Seward told technology publication The Verge in a statement: “We abhor this kind of government censorship of the internet, and have great coverage of how to get around such bans around the world.”  A Google spokesman said “The Revolution Of Our Times” app recently pulled from its app store, which lets users role play as Hong Kong protesters, violated a long-standing policy “prohibiting developers from capitalizing on sensitive events, such as attempting to make money from serious ongoing conflicts or tragedies through a game.”  The People’s Daily newspaper, in its commentary on Tuesday, said Apple did not have a sense of right and wrong, and ignored the truth. Making the app available on Apple’s Hong Kong App Store at this time was “opening the door” to violent protesters in the former British colony, the newspaper wrote.   The HKmap.live app was taken down from Apple’s App Store globally on Wednesday but continued to work for users who had previously downloaded it in Hong Kong, Reuters found. A web version of HKmap.live was still viewable on iPhones.  Word of its removal spread quickly in Hong Kong, where residents had been campaigning for months, in sometimes violent demonstrations, initially to protest a now-withdrawn extradition bill and now in a broader push for democratic rights.  “Does the entire world have to suck up to the garbage Communist Party?” one commentator, Yip Lou Jie, said in an online forum, LIHKG, used by protesters in Hong Kong.  But Simon Young, associate dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Hong Kong, said Apple seemed to have a case, given the circumstances.  “It sounds like they are being responsible. To do nothing when it’s being used for a specific purpose that actually facilitates these protests, to do nothing would be rather irresponsible,” he said.  Apple’s action has come amid a furor surrounding the U.S. National Basketball Association after a team official tweeted in support of the protests in Hong Kong, which led Chinese sponsors and partners to cut ties with the NBA.

Quartz Chief Executive Zach Seward told technology publication The Verge in a statement: “We abhor this kind of government censorship of the internet, and have great coverage of how to get around such bans around the world.”  A Google spokesman said “The Revolution Of Our Times” app recently pulled from its app store, which lets users role play as Hong Kong protesters, violated a long-standing policy “prohibiting developers from capitalizing on sensitive events, such as attempting to make money from serious ongoing conflicts or tragedies through a game.”  The People’s Daily newspaper, in its commentary on Tuesday, said Apple did not have a sense of right and wrong, and ignored the truth. Making the app available on Apple’s Hong Kong App Store at this time was “opening the door” to violent protesters in the former British colony, the newspaper wrote.   The HKmap.live app was taken down from Apple’s App Store globally on Wednesday but continued to work for users who had previously downloaded it in Hong Kong, Reuters found. A web version of HKmap.live was still viewable on iPhones.  Word of its removal spread quickly in Hong Kong, where residents had been campaigning for months, in sometimes violent demonstrations, initially to protest a now-withdrawn extradition bill and now in a broader push for democratic rights.  “Does the entire world have to suck up to the garbage Communist Party?” one commentator, Yip Lou Jie, said in an online forum, LIHKG, used by protesters in Hong Kong.  But Simon Young, associate dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Hong Kong, said Apple seemed to have a case, given the circumstances.  “It sounds like they are being responsible. To do nothing when it’s being used for a specific purpose that actually facilitates these protests, to do nothing would be rather irresponsible,” he said.  Apple’s action has come amid a furor surrounding the U.S. National Basketball Association after a team official tweeted in support of the protests in Hong Kong, which led Chinese sponsors and partners to cut ties with the NBA.

Shopping malls closed early on Thursday to avoid becoming targets of planned protests and the city’s metro, which has borne the brunt of violent unrest in recent weeks, shut three hours early.   By mid-evening protests had failed to materialize in any sizeable form, with some 60 demonstrators gathering outside one police station. In contrast to massive daytime rallies, night protests generally see a few hundred demonstrators stage scattered events, often late at night.  Four months of large and often violent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.  The protests started in opposition to an extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent for trial in Communist Party-controlled mainland Chinese courts, but have morphed into a broader pro-democracy movement.  China has accused some foreign governments, including Britain and the United States, of fanning anti-China sentiment over Hong Kong.  Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam introduced emergency laws last Friday, banning face masks that protesters use to shield their identities, in an effort to quell unrest. But the move sparked some of the worst violence since protests started.  Many Hong Kongers fear the emergency laws could be expanded and further erode their rights.  Hong Kong’s government said on Thursday that a policy address from Lam scheduled for Oct. 16, when the Legislative Council next sits, would not include any further measures to combat the violence.  “We have no further intention, particularly in the context of the policy address, of devising new measures to clamp down on protests,” Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung told a news conference. Lam has not ruled out asking Beijing for help.  Cheung said the government’s operations were not aimed at stopping protests, but violence. “We never clamp down on protests, we only clamp down on violence,” he said.  “A protest if it’s legal, if it’s lawful, if it’s peaceful...in Hong Kong, assemblies and protests are part of Hong Kong’s landscape, part of our core values.”  Many Hong Kongers fear Beijing is eroding their freedoms and are angry at the city’s government for failing to solve social issues such as unaffordable housing and poor job prospects.  Under a “one country, two systems” formula adopted when Britain returned its former colony to China in 1997, Hong Kong has a high-degree of autonomy and its residents enjoy freedoms that do not exist on the mainland.  “The violence has been accelerating a lot. I think they (police) are really damaging the law and the legal system,” said protester David, a 27-year-old accountant, wearing a black mask and clutching a sign saying “Free Hong Kong”.  Police have fired live rounds and used baton charges and water cannons to quell the unrest. Two teenagers have been shot. Police fired 367 tear gas canisters over the long weekend, when tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets.    Apple Inc on Wednesday removed an app protesters have used to track police, prompting some to say they may “visit” Apple stores in Hong Kong.  Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmaker Charles Mok wrote to Apple’s chief Tim Cook urging the company to stand up to Chinese pressure and requested the app be restored.  Mok said in his letter that the app “helps citizens avoid areas where pedestrians not involved in any criminal activities might be subjected to police brutality”.  “We Hong Kongers will definitely look closely at whether Apple chooses to uphold its commitment to free expression and other basic human rights, or become an accomplice for Chinese censorship and oppression,” Mok said in the letter.  China’s mainland security forces are not part of Hong Kong police operations, the government said on Thursday, responding to internet rumors the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and mainland police were involved.  The PLA has a garrison in Hong Kong but troops have remained in barracks since the protests started.  On Sunday, Chinese soldiers issued a warning to Hong Kong protesters who shone lasers at their barracks in the city, in the first direct interaction between mainland military forces and demonstrators.  Besides calling for the protection of their civil liberties, many young protesters are also incensed at Hong Kong’s widening inequality, sky-high property prices and poor job prospects.  The Asian financial hub is facing its first recession in a decade, but it boasts the world’s most expensive property market, with prices rocketing over 200% in the past decade, driven by limited housing supply and mainland Chinese buyers.  Tiny living spaces are common, some of the poorest living in cage homes - wire mesh hutches stacked on top of each other. A protester last month scrawled graffiti reading: “7K for a house like a cell and you really think we out here scared of jail”. 	Reuters

Apple on Thursday was the latest company to face criticism over an app that helped Hong Kong protesters track police movements.  Following are recent news stories involving consumer-facing U.S. and European companies which have spoken out or taken action on issues relating to the protests.   The iPhone maker has removed HKmap.live app saying it was used to ambush police, as well as BackupHK, a separate app that served as a mirror of the HKmap.live app.  Apple had only approved the app last week after rejecting it earlier in the month. The Chinese Communist Party’s official newspaper called the app “poisonous” and decried what it said was Apple’s complicity in helping protesters.   Houston Rockets sneakers and other merchandise were pulled from several Nike stores in major Chinese cities amid the furor surrounding a tweet from the team’s general manager in support of anti-government protests in Hong Kong.  VF Corp’s apparel brand Vans removed “a small number” of submissions in a sneaker design competition including one apparently giving a shout out to Hong Kong protests.  The jeweler deleted a Twitter advertisement posted on Monday showing a female model with her hand covering her right eye, which some people interpreted as supporting the protesters in Hong Kong.  A female medic, who was hospitalized after being hit by a pellet in the eye during protests in August, became a symbol for what protesters say is excessive police force.  A Tiffany spokesman said the campaign image was photographed in May and was not intended to be a political statement of any kind.  The videogame maker’s unit Blizzard Entertainment on Tuesday said it had removed a Hong Kong player’s video-on-demand (VOD) replay of a Hearthstone match and banned the player from Hearthstone esports for a year, after the masked player called for the liberation of the region in a post-game interview.  In early September, the Spanish fashion brand issued a statement on Chinese social media expressing support for China’s sovereignty, after a local Hong Kong newspaper asked if closure of four Zara stores on Sept. 2 was in support of a student strike in Hong Kong.   The Italian luxury label, owned by Capri Holdings Ltd and its artistic director, Donatella Versace, apologized in August after one of its T-shirts depicting the Chinese-controlled territories of Hong Kong and Macau as countries was criticized on Chinese social media.  LVMH’s Givenchy apologized in a Weibo statement in August after T-shirts that listed Hong Kong and Taiwan as countries received criticism. 	Reuters

360	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N26V1X3	October 9, 2019 /  12:31 AM / 6 months ago	Excited China fans cheer NBA game despite row over Hong Kong tweet	SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Thousands of Chinese fans cheered and clapped through an NBA exhibition game in Shanghai on Thursday after days of controversy and online vitriol over a now-deleted tweet by a team manager backing anti-China protests in Hong Kong.  The crowd waved Chinese flags in the arena before the game started, but the packed stands gave the players a huge welcome on court and shouted enthusiastically throughout the game.  The Nets won 114-111.  The tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey supporting sometimes violent anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong sparked a furore in China，with a fan event canceled and Chinese partners cutting ties with the National Basketball Association (NBA).  The exhibition game was most notable for a facial injury to Nets guard Kyrie Irving a minute in. Irving, one of the headliners in the NBA’s promotion, was taken off immediately and did not return.  “Most people are very rational today,” one spectator said. “We all love basketball. But if NBA players or officials continue to make some of these wrong comments, we have no choice” but to protest.  Roads near the stadium were blocked off ahead of the game and those attending had to go through two rounds of security checks.  Street vendors were selling Chinese national flags outside the arena and some people had called online on those going to the game to carry flags in a show of force.  Some people protested before the game outside the stadium against Morey and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who has spoken out in support of the tweet.   “There are no Lakers or Nets fans tonight. We are all Chinese basketball fans,” one protester said.  NBA events scheduled on Tuesday and Wednesday were canceled and Chinese sponsors and partners have suspended or severed ties with the league. Sponsors’ logos were noticeable by their absence on the court.   State broadcaster CCTV and Tencent (0700.HK) did not show Thursday’s game and will not show the rematch scheduled for Saturday in Shenzhen.  The Hong Kong protests began in opposition to a bill allowing extradition to mainland China but have since evolved into broader calls for democracy, with activists throwing petrol bombs, setting street fires and trashing metro stations.  China has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong, and Chinese state media has characterized Morey’s tweet as the latest example of meddling in China’s own affairs.  The former British colony of Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula guaranteeing it wide-ranging autonomy.  The NBA’s business in China, which took years to cultivate and is estimated to be worth more than $4 billion, is under immense pressure.    The NBA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Saturday’s Lakers-Nets game would take place.  Houston Rockets sneakers and other merchandise have been pulled from several Nike (NKE.N) and NBA stores in major Chinese cities, with the franchise’s direct association with Morey making it a central target of the furore. Managers at some of the Nike stores said they had been instructed to remove the goods via an internal memo from management.   A specialist NBA store at a major shopping center in Shanghai removed all Rockets merchandise, as did the basketball-themed NBA Playzone family entertainment centres in Beijing and Shanghai.   “Rockets products were hot before and when you stepped into the store, it was full of red. Now, it is mostly yellow and blue,” the colors of the Golden State Warriors, said a manager at the Shanghai Playzone, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.  Nike and the NBA did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment.  Other major Chinese retailers, including Alibaba (BABA.N) and JD.com (JD.O), also pulled Rockets merchandise off their various platforms. Alibaba and JD.com declined to comment.  Chinese state and party-backed media continued to publish items critical of the NBA. The official English China Daily published an editorial cartoon on Thursday playing on the NBA’s official logo of an athlete dribbling a basketball. The cartoon instead put a bomb labeled “politics” in the athlete’s hand, leaving the basketball fallen by the wayside.    U.S. sports broadcaster ESPN was also criticized for its coverage of the row after using a map that appeared to endorse Beijing’s claims to both self-ruled Taiwan and disputed territories in the South China Sea.

361	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1WO0L7	October 9, 2019 /  7:28 AM / in 6 months	China plans to restrict visas for U.S. visitors with 'anti-China' links	SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China is planning tighter visa restrictions for U.S. nationals with ties to anti-China groups, people with knowledge of the proposed curbs said, following similar U.S. restrictions on Chinese nationals, as relations between the countries sour.  China’s Ministry of Public Security has for months been working on rules to limit the ability of anyone employed, or sponsored, by U.S. intelligence services and human rights groups to travel to China.  The proposed changes follow the introduction by the United States of tighter rules for visas for Chinese scholars in May.  New U.S. visa restrictions announced on Tuesday, on Chinese government and Communist Party officials the United States believes responsible for the detention or abuse of Muslim minorities, had bolstered the case for the new Chinese restrictions, one of the sources said.  “This is not something we want to do but we don’t seem to have any choice,” the source said.  The Chinese rules would mandate the drafting of a list of U.S. military and CIA-linked institutions and rights groups, and the addition of their employees to a visa blacklist, according to the sources, who declined to be identified.  The tighter restrictions come amid heightened concern in Beijing that the United States and other governments are using such organizations to incite anti-government protests in both mainland China and Hong Kong, and would also be in retaliation for the U.S. visa restrictions against Chinese researchers and officials, the first source said.  “The plan has been widely discussed by senior police officers over recent months, but made more likely to be implemented after the Hong Kong protests and the U.S. visa ban on Chinese officials,” the source said.  China’s National Immigration Administration, which operates under the Ministry of Public Security, did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.  Rivalry between the United States and China is fueled by a range of issues including commercial competition, human rights  and worries about security.  The United States took a major step in confronting China in May when it added Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co and 70 affiliates to its so-called Entity List, banning the Chinese company from acquiring components and technology from U.S. firms without U.S. government approval.  The United States suspects Huawei’s equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, which the Chinese firm has repeatedly denied.  The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday cited the mistreatment of Uighur Muslims and others in a decision to add 20 Chinese public security bureaus and eight companies to a trade blacklist, including the world’s largest maker of video surveillance gear, Hikvision, and the world’s most valuable artificial intelligence startup, SenseTime.  The U.S. moves have cast a pall over U.S.-China trade talks in Washington on Thursday and Friday between Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  The United States is also moving ahead with discussions on possible restrictions on capital flows to China, with a focus on investments by U.S. government pension funds, Bloomberg reported.  The latest tit-for-tat visa restrictions began in April when some prominent Chinese scholars had their U.S. visas revoked.  The following month, the United States introduced legislation intended to prohibit anyone employed or sponsored by the Chinese military from getting student or research visas.  China has denounced what it sees as punitive U.S. action against its nationals.  U.S. citizens hoping to visit China’s mainland must apply for an entry visa. U.S. passport holders do not need a visa to enter Hong Kong. 	Reuters

Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) renewed its exclusive digital partnership with the NBA in July, securing rights to stream U.S. games in China, a market with an estimated 500 million fans.  But the Chinese social media giant behind the ubiquitous app WeChat may now become a corporate casualty of the deepening row sparked by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, who expressed support for Hong Kong protests in a tweet over the weekend.  That prompted a furore in mainland China, and local sponsors of the games have pulled out.  Tencent halted broadcasting games involving the Rockets over the weekend and later said it would stop broadcasting the entire preseason after NBA commissioner Adam Silver voiced his support for Morey’s “freedom of political expression” on Tuesday.  It said users subscribing to the Rockets games can switch to feeds from other NBA teams or apply for a refund.  Refunds have become a hot topic online with more than 3 million views on Twitter-like Weibo social media platform on Wednesday. Some users claimed they had received automatic refunds ranging from 20 yuan to 264 yuan ($2.80-$37), depending on what packages they subscribe to.  Tencent declined to comment on refunds.  The Houston Rockets became the most popular NBA team in China after drafting Chinese player Yao Ming with the first overall pick in the 2002 draft. He became a star and helped build the NBA’s following in China.  Tencent extended its NBA partnership through 2024-25 season in July, according to an NBA statement. The value of the deal was not disclosed, but Chinese sports news portal Lanxiong Sports reported it was worth about $1.5 billion.   Nearly 500 million people watched last season’s NBA games on Tencent’s video platform, up threefold since the 2014-15 season, Tencent said in July.  Tencent isn’t the only company distancing itself from business dealings with the NBA. Chinese Smartphone maker Vivo, state-run broadcaster CCTV and sportswear maker ANTA Sports Products Ltd (2020.HK) all halted cooperation with the NBA on Monday.  	Reuters

The NBA on Thursday published a post on Chinese social networking platform Weibo promoting the match between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets, accompanied by a short clip featuring star players LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. The game is scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m. local time (1130 GMT).  NBA events scheduled on Tuesday and Wednesday were cancelled and Chinese sponsors and partners suspended or severed ties with the league after Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted last week supporting anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong.

Apple rejected the crowdsourcing app, HKmap.live, earlier this month but then reversed course last week, allowing the app to appear on its App Store. The approval drew a sharply worded commentary criticizing Apple in the Chinese Communist Party’s official newspaper, the People’s Daily.  Apple said in a statement that “many concerned customers in Hong Kong” contacted the company about the mapping app. Apple said it immediately began investigating the app’s use and found it “has been used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong.”  “The app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,” the statement said.  Under Apple’s rules and policies, apps that meet its standards to appear in the App Store have sometimes been removed after their release if they were found to facilitate illegal activity or threaten public safety.

MTR Corp, whose network carries about 5 million passengers a day, said a line servicing a densely populated area in the city’s New Territories would not operate and all lines would close by 9 p.m. (1300 GMT), more than three hours earlier than normal.  The usually efficient service was forced to shut down after arson attacks on Friday night, paralysing transportation across the Chinese-ruled city. It has operated only partially since.  The closures also come ahead of more protests on Thursday and others planned for the rest of the week.  The unrest started more than four months ago in what began as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill but has since widened into a pro-democracy movement amid fears that China is encroaching on Hong Kong’s freedoms.  Those freedoms were guaranteed under a “one country, two systems” formula when Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, a formula that allows wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland. However, the unrest has pushed the special administrative region into its worst political crisis since 1997 and poses the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.  Demonstrations planned for Thursday include some in support of Taiwan’s National Day and rallies against perceived police brutality, with protesters expected to wear eye patches to show solidarity with a young protester who was injured in clashes with police.  The city is still recovering from a long weekend of violent clashes between police and tens of thousands of protesters.  Scores of shops remain boarded up after being trashed or torched, anti-government graffiti is scrawled over bus stops and buildings, and some streets remain littered with broken glass and twisted metal debris.  Protest violence has often targeted the MTR, which is blamed for closing stations at the government’s behest to stop demonstrators gathering.  The city’s economy has been hammered by the protests as it faces its first recession in a decade. The tourism and retail sectors have been hit particularly hard as visitors stay away.  Shopping malls and businesses have been forced to shut repeatedly, while a slew of events and conferences have moved to other locations, including Singapore.  The political sensitivities of the protests have also ensnared international businesses, with the U.S. National Basketball Association (NBA) the latest example after Chinese organisers on Wednesday cancelled a fan event over a tweet by a team official supporting protests in Hong Kong.  Luxury jeweller Tiffany & Co and U.S. sports brand Vans have also withdrawn an advertisement and shoe design seen as favouring protesters. 	Reuters

In a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Rubio said Chinese-owned apps “are increasingly being used to censor content and silence open discussion on topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese Government and Communist Party.”   The Treasury secretary heads the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews mergers and stock purchases to ensure they do not harm national security. Treasury said it does not comment on specific cases.   Rubio said there was growing evidence that TikTok in the United States was censoring content that is “not in line” with the Chinese government.  China “is using these apps to advance their foreign policy and globally suppress freedom of speech, expression, and other freedoms that we as Americans so deeply cherish,” Rubio said.   A U.S. TikTok spokeswoman said the company stores all of its U.S. user data in the United States.  “The Chinese government does not request that TikTok censor content, and would not have jurisdiction regardless, as TikTok does not operate there,” she added.  Lawyers said a CFIUS review of such a deal would be unusual for the panel, which has increasingly flexed its muscle to stymy Chinese investment in sensitive U.S. industries but has shied away from using censorship to justify reviewing deals.  “It wouldn’t be shocking, but it would be atypical,” for CFIUS to review a transaction over censorship concerns, said David Hanke, an attorney with Arent Fox who helped craft a legislative overhaul of the committee last year. “It also would not be the first time CFIUS has blazed new trails over China-specific concerns,” he added.  The 1950 law establishing CFIUS does not limit the definition of national security. However, another attorney who declined to be named said CFIUS would likely flag critical technology or the acquisition of sensitive personal data if it took up the deal.   ByteDance is one of China’s fastest growing startups. It owns the country’s leading news aggregator, Jinri Toutiao, as well as TikTok, which has attracted celebrities like Ariana Grande and Katy Perry along with legions of U.S. teenagers.  The company’s Chinese ownership and sudden spike in popularity have raised concerns among U.S. lawmakers.    Rubio has become increasingly outspoken in his hawkish stance on China. He slammed the National Basketball Association this week for expressing regret over a deleted tweet by Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey in support of Hong Kong protesters. He has also urged the Trump administration to bar exemptions that would allow us tech companies to sell to China’s blacklisted telecoms giant Huawei.   Congress cannot compel CFIUS to review individual cases, but the powerful committee does have jurisdiction to review deals that were not previously flagged to CFIUS by the parties involved.   Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd earlier this year agreed to a request by CFIUS to sell popular gay dating app Grindr, which it had owned since 2016.  Kunlun drew U.S. ire after it gave some Beijing-based engineers access to personal information of millions of Americans such as private messages and HIV status.  ByteDance bought Musical.ly for nearly $1 billion in December 2017. It later shuttered Musical.ly and moved users to a revamped version of its own TikTok app, which serves non-Chinese markets.  Musical.ly, released in 2014, and TikTok, launched in 2016, both enable users to create and share short singing and dancing videos that are set to well-known songs, with numerous special effect filters.  The company’s original app Douyin is similar to TikTok but is only available in China and complies with local censorship requirements.  ByteDance counts venture firm Sequoia Capital and big private-equity firms such as KKR, General Atlantic and Hillhouse Capital Group as backers, sources have told Reuters. 	Reuters

370	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N26U0K6	October 9, 2019 /  1:40 AM / 6 months ago	UPDATE 9-Chinese organisers cancel NBA fan event amid free speech row	* Chinese organisers cancel NBA fan event on eve of game  * China Daily accuses NBA of endorsing Hong Kong violence  * Brooklyn Nets training session in Shanghai cancelled  * Row threatens NBA’s multibillion-dollar China business (Adds Pompeo comments in paragraphs 15-16)  By David Stanway and Xihao Jiang  SHANGHAI, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Chinese organisers on Wednesday cancelled a fan event on the eve of a National Basketball Association (NBA) exhibition game in Shanghai, the latest fallout in a growing dispute over a tweet by a team official supporting the recent protests in Hong Kong.  Chinese sponsors and partners have been cutting ties with the NBA after the Twitter post by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey last week supporting anti-government protests in the Chinese-ruled city.  The Shanghai Sports Federation said the cancellation of the fan event ahead of Thursday’s game between the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers was due to the “inappropriate attitude” of Morey and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver.  A Wednesday afternoon news conference with both teams was indefinitely delayed, organisers said. Outside the team hotel, workers tore down massive banners advertising the game, according to a Reuters witness.  The Hong Kong protests were sparked by opposition to a bill allowing extradition to mainland China, but have evolved into broader calls for democracy. China has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong. The NBA controversy also comes against the backdrop of a U.S.-China trade war that escalated after Washington imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials on Tuesday.  Silver said on Tuesday the league supported Morey’s right to exercise his freedom of expression, further angering authorities and some fans in China and threatening the NBA’s business there, said to be worth more than $4 billion.  Morey deleted the tweet and apologised on Monday, but Chinese broadcasters, sportswear companies and sponsors have said they are reviewing their ties with the NBA, which has had a presence in China since 1992.  The NBA initially described the anger over Morey’s post as “regrettable,” drawing criticism from U.S. politicians, who accused the league of putting its China business ahead of free speech.  Silver, speaking in Japan before a preseason game between the Rockets and Toronto Raptors, said it was not up to the league to regulate what players, employees and team owners said.  On Tuesday night, during a preseason game between the NBA’s 76ers and the Guangzhou Loong Lions of the Chinese Basketball Association, security at Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia confiscated signs from a couple that read “Free Hong Kong” and “Free HK.” Security later removed the couple from the game after they yelled, “Free Hong Kong,” a local NBC affiliate reported.  Security officials warned the couple following multiple complaints from guests and verbal confrontations with others in attendance, the team said in a statement.  “Ultimately, the decision was made by Wells Fargo Center personnel to remove the guests from the premises, which was accomplished without incident,” the team said.  On Wednesday, an editorial in the official English-language China Daily accused Silver of “brazenly endorsing Morey’s secessionist-supporting tweet” and giving “a shot to the arms of the rioters of Hong Kong.”  “If Silver thinks endorsing the indiscriminate violence the radical Hong Kong protesters are resorting to ... is supporting freedom of expression, then he should think again,” it said.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, asked in an interview with PBS about the NBA controversy, said American businesses were waking up to the risks of operating in China.  “The reputational cost to these companies I think will prove to be higher and higher as Beijing’s long arm reaches out to them and destroys their capacity for them, their employees - in the NBA’s case teams members and general managers - to speak freely about their political opinions,” Pompeo said.  Some Chinese fans expressed dismay at the way the controversy had spread, while voicing their support for Beijing’s view.  “I’m patriotic of course. I support that Hong Kong is part of China, but I just don’t understand this,” said Yu Jie, a fan waiting to see the players in Shanghai.  The Global Times, a Chinese tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily newspaper, said the NBA was treating the Chinese market with disregard.  “Tweeting something offensive to the Chinese people before a series of NBA promotional activities in China only shows a lack of intellect, respect, and responsibility,” it said.  Basketball is the most popular sport in China, with about 500 million people consuming NBA content. The league has deals with TV and digital media outlets across the country, and teams have played exhibition games annually since 2014.  NBA China, launched in 2008 to run the league’s business, is now worth more than $4 billion, according to Forbes.  The NBA had planned media events in Shanghai ahead of the Nets-Lakers game, but Chinese organisers cancelled an event at a Shanghai school on Tuesday and an open training session with the Nets on Wednesday.  State television dropped plans to air the NBA exhibition games in China this week, saying a country’s sovereignty and social stability were “not within the scope of freedom of speech.”  Some Chinese fans have asked for streaming subscription refunds from exclusive service provider Tencent, which halted broadcast of Rockets games after the Morey tweet.  Online travel agency Ctrip said on Tuesday it had stopped selling tickets to NBA games and NBA-related tour packages. Smartphone maker Vivo and sportswear maker ANTA Sports Products Ltd (2020.HK) have also stopped working with the NBA.  Chinese e-commerce platforms Alibaba and JD.com appeared to have taken Houston Rockets merchandise including sneakers off their sales platforms including mobile apps as of Wednesday night.  The escalating controversy did not seem to bother some waiting outside Shanghai’s Ritz Carlton hotel to catch a glimpse of the NBA players.  “Personal opinions belong to them. It doesn’t affect us chasing the stars,” Xu Ziyang, a university student from Jiangsu, told Reuters. 	Reuters
371	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1WO07B	October 9, 2019 /  3:08 AM / 6 months ago	Hong Kong protesters stage peaceful rallies calling for 'liberation'	HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hundreds of black clad pro-democracy demonstrators chanted “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times” outside the High Court on Wednesday as a leading activist appeared to appeal a six-year jail sentence for rioting in 2016.  The court’s walls were scrawled with graffiti reading: “History will absolve us”, “If we burn you burn with us” and “No turn back 4HK”.  The Chinese-ruled financial hub is struggling to recover from a weekend of violent clashes between police and tens of thousands of protesters, with parts virtually cut off due to a paralyzed metro that was a target of vandalism amid four months of often violent unrest.  Scores of shops were boarded up after also being trashed or torched, and more protests are expected in coming days. Some streets were littered with broken glass and twisted metal debris.  On Wednesday night, some 200 protesters staged a shopping mall demonstration in the New Territories district of Ma On Shan. The peaceful rally saw protesters sitting or standing and chanting “Stand with Hong Kong, fight for freedom”.  The protests began in opposition to a now withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent to China, but have broadened into a pro-democracy movement amid fear that Beijing is undermining Hong Kong’s freedoms.  Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula, which gives it wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.  The unrest is the worst political crisis 1997 and the biggest challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came into power in 2012.  Edward Leung, 27, one of the leaders of a movement advocating independence from China, and two other activists in 2016 received the harshest sentences handed down to pro-democracy leaders since 1997.  In his appeal, Leung’s lawyer argued his sentence was disproportionate to his offence, citing other more violent protesters receiving lighter sentences. His case was adjourned on Wednesday ahead of judgment.  Outside the court, hundreds of protesters wore black masks in defiance of colonial-era emergency laws banning face coverings, which were brought in on Friday to quell the unrest but which have incited more violence.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday did not rule out asking China, which has troops in barracks in Hong Kong, for help to end the unrest, with Hong Kong’s economy hit hard and facing its first recession in a decade.  Many malls closed early to prevent protesters gaining entry.  Inside the mall in Ma On Shan seven protesters, one in a wheelchair, held up signs reading: “Support security guards who are dedicated to their job, strongly condemn police abusing power and arresting people randomly.”  A night earlier, security guards in the same mall tried to stop police entering to chase a protester. Media said the guards were arrested.  A slew of international events and conferences due to be held in the city have been canceled, with the organizers of the Hong Kong Squash Open the latest, stating they were postponing the event “in view of the current situation”.  More than 200 shops and public utilities had been damaged in the weekend’s violent clashes. More than 100 restaurants have closed in the past month, putting around 2,000 people out of work, a representative from an association of catering professionals told public broadcaster RTHK.  Authorities have described protesters as “militant activists”, but many Hong Kong residents are also angry at the emergency powers, fearing their civil rights could be eroded.  More than 2,300 people have been arrested since June, while two teenagers have been shot and wounded in skirmishes with police. Scores of people, including police, have been injured.     Hong Kong’s unrest has started to affect global companies and sport, with luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co and U.S. sports brand Vans withdrawing an advertisement and shoe design seen as favoring protesters.  China has canceled broadcasting NBA basketball games after an executive of the U.S. National Basketball Association team the Houston Rockets backed protesters in a tweet. Chinese sponsors and partners have cut ties with the NBA.  The NBA’s business in China is worth more than $4 billion, according to Forbes.     “Every American has the right to voice their support for democracy and human rights for Hong Kong. Full stop,” said one-time U.S. presidential candidate and former First Lady Hillary Clinton on her official Twitter account on Wednesday.  In a separate case, a top online gamer from Hong Kong who showed support for the protests was removed from an international tournament he won, forcing him to forgo prize money that media reports put at $10,000.   Blizzard Entertainment, via their brand Hearthstone, said the gamer, identified as “Blitzchung”, had violated rules and would not be allowed to play in any Hearthstone e-sports games for the next 12 months.  China has warned foreign governments to stay out of the protests which they deem as an “internal affair” and have accused some, including Britain and the United States, of fanning anti-China sentiment.  Pakistan on Wednesday reaffirmed its commitment to Hong’s Kong’s “one country, two systems”, said China’s foreign ministry, after Pakistan Prime Minster Imran Khan met Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing.  “The Pakistan side reiterated that affairs of Hong Kong were China’s internal matter and all countries should uphold international law and basic norms of non-interference in internal affairs of other countries,” the ministry said in a statement.

In a commentary the newspaper did not mention the name of the location app, but it decried what it said was Apple’s complicity in helping the protesters and questioned whether Apple was “thinking clearly”.  One such map that is available on the Apple app store, the HKmap.live app, has become a lightning rod on Twitter for criticism and support of the protests. The developer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Saturday in a tweet they said that Apple had “many business considerations” but had “make thing(s) right.”  Apple is the latest foreign company to catch heat in relation to the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, which have lasted four months.  The National Basketball Association (NBA) and U.S. sports brand Vans also have become embroiled in controversies over the protests.  The piece on the website of the People’s Daily said Apple did not have a sense of right and wrong, and ignored the truth.  Making the App available on Apple’s Hong Kong app Store at this time was “opening the door” to violent protesters in the former British colony.  “Letting poisonous software have its way is a betrayal of the Chinese people’s feelings,” the paper said.  Apple did not respond to a request for a comment. 	Reuters

The blue-chip index, whose components make two-thirds of their earnings abroad, was slightly off the day’s highs but was still up 0.1% by 0858 GMT, while the FTSE 250 was down 0.1%.  A report that the European bloc was ready to offer a concession to the contested Irish backstop plan lifted the pound, with exporter stocks clinging to gains made earlier in the session when Brexit sentiment was unclear.  Shares in companies that earn a chunk of their earnings in the U.S. dollar including GlaxoSmithKline and Reckitt Benckiser were still offering the most support to the main index.  Just Eat climbed 2% to top the FTSE 100 leader-board, after its Dutch rival Takeaway.com reported a surge in quarterly orders.  GVC outperformed the midcap index with a 3% rise as the Ladbrokes owner boosted its annual core earnings target for the second time in three months on robust demand in its betting shops despite tighter regulation.  That news helped rival William Hill gain 1.5%.  Financials, which have been hammered this year due to the Hong Kong protests and fears of a recession, rose 0.6%.  The sub-index has plunged 6% since the start of 2019, severely lagging a near 7% rise in the FTSE 100 over the same period and being the only major sector with year-to-date losses.

Now, in pursuit of $$, the @NBA is shamefully retreating.” - Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, on Twitter.  - “We must put human rights above profit. And that means standing with #HongKong. The NBA’s refusal to denounce Communist China is shameful. I’m requesting a meeting with @NBA Commissioner Silver to discuss the importance of supporting the brave individuals fighting for freedom.” - Republican U.S. Senator Rick Scott of Florida, on Twitter.  - “Um, yeah, we apologize, you know. You know, we love China, we love playing there. ... They show us the most support and love, so, you know, we appreciate them as a fan base, and we love everything, you know, they’re about and we appreciate the support they give us, individually and as an organization, so ... we love you.” - Houston Rockets guard James Harden, in a Reuters TV interview.      - “I watched the Rockets for 21 years, but I’m still a Chinese person first and foremost.” - one social media user.  - “The NBA wants money, and the Communist Party of China is asking them to deny the most basic of human rights. In response, the NBA issued a statement saying money is the most important thing.” - Republican U.S. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, in a statement.   - “The one thing that is terribly misunderstood, and often ignored, by the western press and those critical of China, is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country’s sovereignty over her homeland. This issue is non-negotiable. ... I don’t know Daryl personally. I am sure he’s a fine NBA general manager, and I will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been. But the hurt this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.” - Joseph Tsai, owner of the Brooklyn Nets NBA team and co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, on his personal Facebook page.  - “And the #NBA, which (correctly) has no problem with players/employees criticizing our gov’t, is now apologizing for criticizing the Chinese gov’t. This is shameful and cannot stand.” - Democratic U.S. Representative Tom Malinowski of New Jersey, on Twitter, referring to the league’s policy of not imposing fines on NBA players protesting deadly police shootings in the United States.   - “China is using its economic power to silence critics—even those in the U.S.  “The United States must lead with our values and speak out for pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong, and not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government.” - Julian Castro, Democratic presidential contender and former U.S. housing secretary.  - Morey “has the right to express his values, and Chinese fans of the Houston Rockets have the right to abandon this team. If the Rockets want to keep its Chinese market, the team need to avoid offending Chinese public.” - Hu Xijin, editor of the state-controlled Global Times newspaper, in a tweet.  - “Chinese govt has a million people locked in concentration camps & is trying to brutally repress Hong Kong demonstrators - and NBA wants to ‘bridge cultural divides’?

The National Basketball Association, which has built a huge following and burgeoning business in China, said in a statement it regretted the remarks by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey. A Chinese-language version seemed to go further, with the league saying it was “extremely disappointed” in Morey’s “inappropriate” remarks.  That prompted a torrent of criticism in U.S. political circles, with a number of U.S. senators excoriating the league for what they saw as a willingness to allow China to censor free speech and trample other American values for the sake of profit.  “The NBA wants money, and the Communist Party of China is asking them to deny the most basic of human rights,” Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska said in a statement. “In response, the NBA issued a statement saying money is the most important thing.”  Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a self-described lifelong Rockets fan, wrote in a tweet on Sunday that he had been proud to see Morey “call out the Chinese Communist Party’s repressive treatment of protesters in Hong Kong.”  “No one should implement a gag rule on Americans speaking out for freedom,” Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer wrote in a tweet.  Other legislators accused the NBA, no stranger to U.S. politics, of a double standard when it comes to China.  NBA stars and some coaches have been outspoken in their criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump, and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has urged players to speak out on issues of concern, including alleged police brutality and gun violence.   Police in Hong Kong have used rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons against pro-democracy demonstrators in the former British colony, which has been plunged into its worst political crisis in decades.  The Rockets’ Morey, who was named NBA executive of the year in 2018, tweeted his support for the protests over the weekend. His initial tweet, which he swiftly deleted, included an image captioned: “Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.”   Morey apologized on Monday.   “I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,” he tweeted.  “I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event,” he said, adding that he had since heard and considered other perspectives and noting that his tweets did not represent the Rockets or the NBA.  Morey’s support for the democracy protests, now in a fourth month, angered Beijing, Chinese fans and the team’s partners in a key market. Some 300 million people play the game in China, NBA Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum told Reuters this month.   NBA China, which conducts the league’s business in the country, was launched in 2008. It is now worth more than $4 billion, according to Forbes.  Some Chinese fans called for a boycott of the Rockets, who are widely followed in China, partly because they drafted Chinese player Yao Ming in 2002. Yao became a star and helped build the NBA’s following there.  “I watched the Rockets for 21 years, but I’m still a Chinese person first and foremost,” one social media user said.   The Chinese Basketball Association, chaired by Yao, said it was suspending “exchanges and cooperation” with the team.  Sportswear brand Li-Ning and sponsor Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPD Bank) Credit Card Center suspended work with the Rockets, while the team’s games were dropped by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV’s sports channel. Chinese technology company Tencent also said it would temporarily stop streaming Rockets games.  CCTV said Morey’s apology did not go far enough. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-controlled Global Times newspaper, tweeted on Monday: “If the Rockets want to keep its Chinese market, the team need to avoid offending Chinese public.”  Joseph Tsai, owner of the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets and co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), said the damage from Morey’s tweet “will take a long time to repair.”  The NBA sought to contain the damage, saying in its statement that it recognized that Morey’s views had “deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.”    “We are extremely disappointed in the inappropriate remarks made by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey,” the league said in the Chinese-language version of its statement.  The NBA added, “we have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together”.  The controversy over Morey’s initial tweet and the NBA’s handling of it arrived at a particularly delicate time in U.S.-China relations, which have soured as a result of the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the two sides on each other’s imports.  U.S. and Chinese deputy trade negotiators launched a new round of talks in Washington on Monday, with neither side showing signs of giving ground. The two days of negotiations are to be followed by the first minister-level trade talks in more than two months.  The NBA is also the latest example of a major brand caught in controversy over the Hong Kong protests.  Many Western fashion brands, including Spain’s Zara (ITX.MC), have been forced to clarify positions on Chinese sovereignty as the protests fuel nationalist fervor.  Chinese internet users in August blacklisted bubble tea brands from Taiwan after a Hong Kong franchise urged solidarity with protesters. 	Reuters

Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) renewed its exclusive digital partnership with the NBA in July, securing rights to stream U.S. games in China, a market with an estimated 500 million fans.  But the Chinese social media giant behind the ubiquitous app WeChat may now become a corporate casualty of the deepening row sparked by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, who expressed support for Hong Kong protests in a tweet over the weekend.  That prompted a furore in mainland China, and local sponsors of the games have pulled out.  Tencent halted broadcasting games involving the Rockets over the weekend and later said it would stop broadcasting the entire preseason after NBA commissioner Adam Silver voiced his support for Morey’s “freedom of political expression” on Tuesday.  It said users subscribing to the Rockets games can switch to feeds from other NBA teams or apply for a refund.  Refunds have become a hot topic online with more than 3 million views on Twitter-like Weibo social media platform on Wednesday. Some users claimed they had received automatic refunds ranging from 20 yuan to 264 yuan ($2.80-$37), depending on what packages they subscribe to.  Tencent declined to comment on refunds.  The Houston Rockets became the most popular NBA team in China after drafting Chinese player Yao Ming with the first overall pick in the 2002 draft. He became a star and helped build the NBA’s following in China.  Tencent extended its NBA partnership through 2024-25 season in July, according to an NBA statement. The value of the deal was not disclosed, but Chinese sports news portal Lanxiong Sports reported it was worth about $1.5 billion.   Nearly 500 million people watched last season’s NBA games on Tencent’s video platform, up threefold since the 2014-15 season, Tencent said in July.  Tencent isn’t the only company distancing itself from business dealings with the NBA. Chinese Smartphone maker Vivo, state-run broadcaster CCTV and sportswear maker ANTA Sports Products Ltd (2020.HK) all halted cooperation with the NBA on Monday.  	Reuters

Recent volatility in U.S. money markets raised concern the Fed’s balance sheet had become too small, leaving banks with inadequate reserves.

Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey apologised on Monday for a Twitter post over the weekend backing the Hong Kong protest. The comment, which was quickly deleted, sparked anger in China, and broadcasters, sportswear companies and sponsors said they would review their relationship with the league.  The NBA initially described the anger over the message as “regrettable”, but Commissioner Adam Silver told a news conference in Japan on Tuesday that it was not up to the NBA to regulate what players, employees and team owners said.  On Wednesday, an editorial in the official English-language China Daily accused Silver of “brazenly endorsing Morey’s secessionist-supporting tweet” and giving “a shot to the arms of the rioters of Hong Kong”.  It said, “If Silver thinks endorsing the indiscriminate violence the radical Hong Kong protesters are resorting to...is supporting freedom of expression, then he should think again.”  The protests were “a bid to liberate the city” and “a secessionist pipe-dream” peddled by demonstrators “to justify their summer hooliganism”, it added.  The state-owned Global Times tabloid accused Silver of caving in to political pressure, saying the NBA was treating the Chinese market with arrogant disregard.  “Tweeting something offensive to the Chinese people before a series of NBA promotional activities in China only shows a lack of intellect, respect, and responsibility,” it said.  Chinese state television has already cancelled plans to air exhibition games played in China this week, saying in a statement that a country’s sovereignty and social stability were “not within the scope of freedom of speech”.

In a commentary the newspaper did not mention the name of the location app, but it decried what it said was Apple’s complicity in helping the protesters and questioned whether Apple was “thinking clearly”.  One such map that is available on the Apple app store, the HKmap.live app, has become a lightning rod on Twitter for criticism and support of the protests. The developer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Saturday in a tweet they said that Apple had “many business considerations” but had “make thing(s) right.”  Apple is the latest foreign company to catch heat in relation to the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, which have lasted four months.  The National Basketball Association (NBA) and U.S. sports brand Vans also have become embroiled in controversies over the protests.  The piece on the website of the People’s Daily said Apple did not have a sense of right and wrong, and ignored the truth.  Making the App available on Apple’s Hong Kong app Store at this time was “opening the door” to violent protesters in the former British colony.  “Letting poisonous software have its way is a betrayal of the Chinese people’s feelings,” the paper said.  Apple did not respond to a request for a comment. 	Reuters

Global companies are walking a tightrope in their marketing campaigns, fearing a backlash from Chinese customers if deemed to be expressing solidarity with the anti-government protests that have plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis in decades.  The U.S. luxury jewellery retailer Tiffany & Co deleted a Twitter advertisement posted on Monday showing a female model with her hand covering her right eye, which some people interpreted as supporting the protesters.  A female medic was hospitalized after being hit by a pellet in the eye during protests in August. She became a symbol for what protesters say is excessive police force.  In an emailed response to Reuters, Tiffany spokesman Nathan Strauss said the campaign image was photographed in May and was not intended to be a political statement of any kind.   “We regret that it may be perceived as such, and in turn have removed the image from our digital and social media channels and will discontinue its use effective immediately,” Strauss said.   Vans last week invited the public to vote for their favorite sneaker design from more than 100,000 submissions from around the world in a Vans Global Custom Culture competition.  Media reported that a design from a Canada-based competitor named Naomiso won the online vote before it was taken down on Saturday.   The design featured a red bauhinia, a flower that symbolizes Hong Kong and is on its flag, and a yellow umbrella, a nod to 2014 protests that some refer to as the umbrella revolution. A group of people wearing helmets, masks and goggles can be seen on the side of the sneaker design.   “Based on the global competitions guidelines, Vans can confirm that a small number of artistic submissions have been removed. This decision was taken to uphold the purpose of Custom Culture,” Vans, a unit of VF Corp, said in a Facebook statement.  Vans did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Tuesday.  A search of the username Naomiso on the Custom Culture’s website did not yield any result on Tuesday.  Some people in Hong Kong have called for a boycott of the sneaker brand on Facebook while some retailers have suspended sales of Vans products.  “Starting from today, every branch of our company will suspend sales of all Vans products,” said Search Sneaker Shop, one of the best-known sneaker stores in Hong Kong, in a Facebook post on Saturday.  However, mainland Chinese users on the Weibo social media platform praised Vans for getting rid of the design, after being enraged by it at first.   “Please everyone let’s support Vans this time. The Hong Kong losers are starting to boycott Vans, but the mainland market will lift it up,” said one Weibo user.  Blizzard Entertainment, a U.S. video game developer, said on Tuesday it had removed video-on-demand (VOD) replay of a Hearthstone match, after a masked Hong Kong player called for the liberation of the region in a post-game interview.

Rockets general manager Daryl Morey apologised on Monday for any hurt caused by the tweet, which he quickly deleted over the weekend.  But China’s government, fans and the team’s partners were not mollified, resulting in loss of sponsors and broadcasts in the world’s second-largest economy and an important National Basketball Association (NBA) market.   However, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver spoke up for freedom of speech saying it was not up to the NBA to regulate what players, employees and team owners said, nor to adjudicate differences between people around the world.  CCTV state television said it strongly opposed Silver’s support of Morey.   Any comments that challenged a country’s sovereignty and social stability were “not within the scope of freedom of speech”, CCTV said, adding it was reviewing its relationship with the NBA.  Months of anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong have angered Beijing, which has accused Western governments of stirring up anti-China sentiment. China rejects outside intervention in Hong Kong as interference.  Chinese smartphone maker Vivo, a key sponsor for the exhibition games in China, announced on Tuesday it was suspending all ties with the NBA, underscoring the strength of the backlash in the country.  Chinese sportswear maker ANTA Sports Products Ltd, which has endorsement contracts with several NBA players including Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson and Boston Celtics forward Gordon Hayward, also said on Tuesday it was halting contract renewal negotiations with the league.  The NBA had earlier issued a statement saying it regretted Morey’s remarks, drawing criticism from U.S. lawmakers.  But Silver, in Japan for an exhibition game, defended Morey’s right to express his opinions.  “It is inevitable that people around the world – including from America and China – will have different viewpoints over different issues,” Silver said in a statement. “It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.”  Silver later told a news conference in Japan, where he is attending an exhibition game, that the NBA was not apologising for Morey “expressing his freedom of expression”.  “I regret, having communicated directly with many friends in China, that so many people are upset, including millions and millions of our fans,” Silver said.  The league has worked for years to cultivate the Chinese market and regularly plays exhibition games there. Its top stars, including Rockets guard James Harden, frequently visit to meet fans and take part in promotions with sponsors.  “As a league we are not willing to compromise those values,” Silver said, referring to freedom of expression.  “I’m sympathetic to our interests here and to our partners who are upset. I don’t think it’s inconsistent on one hand to be sympathetic to them and at the same time stand by our principles.”  Silver said the league also supported Brooklyn Nets owner and Alibaba Group co-founder Joseph Tsai, who issued a lengthy statement criticising Morey’s tweet.  Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang referred to criticism of Morey’s comment by the Chinese Basketball Association, which he said made China’s position “very clear”.  “I suggest they pay attention to the reaction of the ordinary Chinese people,” Geng told a regular briefing.  Exchanges and cooperation would not work if people failed to understand public opinion and China would take “firm and powerful measures to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and security”, he said.  The NBA’s regular season, to which CCTV owns the exclusive Chinese broadcast rights, begins this month.   Tech giant Tencent Holdings has exclusive internet streaming rights in China, which media reports have said are worth about $1.58 billion. It has said it would temporarily stop showing Rockets games.  The decision heaps pressure on the league, which faces criticism on multiple fronts about its handling of the controversy.  Its apology on Sunday had disappointed some who see the league as the most progressive of the U.S. sports organizations. Silver has in the past urged players to speak out on issues of concern at home, including questions of police brutality and gun violence.  Tencent said in July that 490 million Chinese fans watched NBA programming on its platforms last season, up threefold since the 2014-2015 season.    A pre-season game between the Nets and the Los Angeles Lakers is set for Thursday in Shanghai, with a rematch scheduled for Saturday in Shenzhen. However, organisers abruptly cancelled a Tuesday media event without explanation.   Several Chinese celebrities announced they would not attend an NBA-organised “fans’ night” on Wednesday.  “The motherland always stands above everything,” actor and singer Evan Li said in a statement.

Shares in Robert Walters, which has a presence in more than 30 countries, fell by 10.4% while larger PageGroup plunged nearly 13% to its lowest in nearly three years.       The deepening crisis over when, how or if Britain leaves the European Union has hit every sector of the UK economy, with many businesses calling a halt to hiring until they have a clearer picture of what a divorce deal will look like.  Demand for new staff at British companies in September increased at the weakest rate in almost eight years, a survey showed on Tuesday.  Companies presented with a negative backdrop will think hard about their spending, and that includes staff costs, said AJ bell investment director Russ Mould.  “The first step in a bleak situation is normally to hold off replacing staff who have moved on to another job. The second step is to make actual job cuts, and it feels like we may be seeing the first small signs of that, given talk of HSBC slashing 10,000 positions,”  Mould said.  Robert Walters said its gross profit in the UK fell 11% in the third quarter, while PageGroup’s second profit warning of the year followed a 4.1% drop in quarterly earnings in its home market.  The news pushed shares of other recruitment companies lower, with Hays (HAYS.L), Sthree STHR.L and Swiss-listed Adecco Group (ADEN.S) all down in early trade.     Fears of a global recession has been a particularly dark cloud hanging over the recruitment industry as the protracted U.S.-China trade war and a weakening German economy keep companies on edge.  The flagging Chinese economy is also having a ripple affect on hiring in countries such as Australia as its export-focused commodities sector goes through a slowdown, Robert Walters finance chief Alan Bannatyne told Reuters.  PageGroup and Robert Walters said business in Hong Kong is also being hurt by the continuing violent protests by pro-democracy activists.  “Looking ahead, the deterioration in trading conditions seen during Q3 across the majority of our regions is anticipated to continue,” PageGroup said.      The company forecast 2019 operating profit in a range of between 140 million pounds ($172.2 million) and 150 million pounds, down from previous guidance of 156.5 million to 168 million pounds.  Robert Walters said it expects annual profit in line with the last year and that it has cut its global headcount by 2% to 4,258.  Bannatyne did say he expects business in the UK to bounce back when Brexit developments give companies and candidates some clarity about the future.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to take Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31 come what may, despite parliament passing a law ordering him to seek a delay if he cannot secure a new transition deal.

Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey apologized on Monday for the tweet, which was quickly deleted over the weekend, but not before facing a swift backlash from Chinese fans and business partners of the NBA team.  “As a lifelong @HoustonRockets fan, I was proud to see @dmorey call out the Chinese Communist Party’s repressive treatment of protesters in Hong Kong,” Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, said on Twitter. “Now, in pursuit of $$, the @NBA is shamefully retreating.”  New Jersey Congressman Tom Malinowski said China was using its economic power to censor speech by Americans in the United States.  “And the #NBA, which (correctly) has no problem with players/employees criticizing our govt, is now apologizing for criticizing the Chinese gov’t. This is shameful and cannot stand,” Malinowski, a Democrat, said in a tweet.  The NBA said it recognized Morey’s views have “deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.”    “We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,” it said.  Josh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri, made references to allegations of human rights abuses in China, including the repression of Uighur Muslims.  “Chinese govt has a million people locked in concentration camps & is trying to brutally repress Hong Kong demonstrators - and NBA wants to “bridge cultural divides”? Cultural divides?”  The Rockets, playing games in Japan, could not immediately be reached for comment. 	Reuters

In an open letter to “NBA fans” posted on his personal Facebook page, Tsai wrote that he felt the need to speak about the issue as someone who had spent his professional life in China.  “Supporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for citizens of China,” he wrote.  “The one thing that is terribly misunderstood, and often ignored, by the western press and those critical of China, is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country’s sovereignty over her homeland. This issue is non-negotiable,” he added.  Tsai went on to note the Opium Wars and Japan’s invasion of China as historical examples for why the Chinese psyche has “heavy baggage” toward threats to sovereignty.  “I don’t know Daryl personally. I am sure he’s a fine NBA general manager, and I will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been. But the hurt this incident has caused will take a long time to repair,” wrote Tsai.  Tsai was born in Taiwan, holds a Canadian passport and went to high school and university in the United States.   Tsai was a key dealmaker early in Alibaba’s rise as China’s largest e-commerce platform, and now serves as its executive vice chairman. He completed the purchase of a 49% stake in the Brooklyn Nets in 2018 and bought the remaining shares of the company last month.  Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The recent wave of protests in Hong Kong originated as a means to oppose a now-withdrawn extradition bill.

The former British colony of Hong Kong has been rocked by months of anti-government protests.  When asked on Thursday to react after Hong Kong police had used real bullets against demonstrators, France’s foreign ministry referred to a statement from the European Union.  That statement called on authorities to show restraint, a proportionate response to the protests and to focus on a political dialogue to defuse tensions.   French officials have sought to keep official reaction under the radar in recent weeks to avoid worsening ties with China before President Emmanuel Macron embarks on a four-day visit there.  The rare statement from the embassy sought to outline efforts by the authorities to resolve the crisis and described Oct. 1 protests during which live rounds were used as an attempt to destabilize the central government.  “The European Union has publicly glorified the rioters’ abuses and has flouted the Hong Kong police’s self-defense measures to defend their lives against their aggressors,” the embassy said.   It said France should show solidarity, given its police force had also experienced violent protests and been under constant criticism and insults from a “malicious fringe” of people.  “In these circumstances, we showed empathy for France. We would like it to show today the same spirit toward us,” the embassy said in its statement.  France’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 	Reuters

The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) garrison in Kowloon district warned a crowd of a few hundred protesters they could be arrested for targeting its troops and barracks walls with laser lights.   One officer shouted through a loudhailer in broken Cantonese - the main language of Hong Kong - “Bear consequences for your actions.”  The stand-off with the PLA came after rallies attended by tens of thousands of protesters earlier on Sunday ended in violent clashes in several locations. Police fired tear gas and baton-charged the crowds, while some demonstrators threw bricks and petrol bombs at police as night fell.  Protesters concealed their faces in defiance of colonial-era emergency laws invoked by the authorities on Friday, which banned face masks. Protesters face a maximum of one year in jail for breaking the mask ban.    Police made their first arrests under the new rules, detaining scores of people. Officers tied their wrists with cable and unmasked their faces before placing them on buses. Some protesters lay in foetal positions on the ground, their wrists tied behind their backs, after being subdued with pepper spray and batons.   “The anti-mask law just fuels our anger and more will people come on to the street,” Lee, a university student wearing a blue mask, said on Sunday, as he marched on Hong Kong island.  “We are not afraid of the new law, we will continue fighting. We will fight for righteousness. I put on the mask to tell the government that I’m not afraid of tyranny.”  Chinese military personnel standing on the roof of the PLA’s Osborn Barracks in Kowloon Tong district held up a sign in English and Chinese which read: “Warning. You are in breach of the law. You may be prosecuted.”   The troops in fatigues also shone spotlights on the crowd and used binoculars and cameras to monitor protesters. The protesters, several thousand of whom passed the barracks, eventually dispersed.  In August, Beijing moved thousands of troops across the border into Hong Kong in an operation state news agency Xinhua described at the time as a routine “rotation”.   But the PLA has remained in barracks since protests started, leaving Hong Kong’s police force to deal with the massive and often violent protests in the Asian financial hub.  The PLA’s top brass has warned violence is “absolutely impermissible”.   Authorities had braced for major protests on Sunday, fearing a recurrence of Friday night’s violent protests which saw the Asian financial center virtually shut down the next day.  Only hours after Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam invoked emergency powers last used more than 50 years ago, mask-wearing protesters took to the streets on Friday, setting subway stations on fire, smashing mainland China banks and clashing with police.  The rallies on Sunday on Hong Kong island and across the harbor in Kowloon had been largely peaceful until police moved to disperse the crowds, saying they were participating in unlawful assemblies, blocking major roads, and ordered protesters to leave immediately.   Hong Kong’s four months of protests have plunged the Chinese-ruled city into its worst political crisis in decades and pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power six years ago.  What started as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill has swelled into a pro-democracy movement against what is seen as Beijing’s increasing grip on the city, undermining its “one country, two systems” status promised when Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997.  China dismisses the accusation, saying foreign governments, including Britain and the United States, have fanned anti-China sentiment.  Protesters on Sunday chanted “Hong Kongers, revolt” and “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong”, as riot police monitored them from overhead walkways and footbridges, some taking photographs and filming the marchers.  Protesters handed out face masks to encourage people to defy the ban. As the day wore on protesters started to target subway stations and China banks, just as they did on Friday, which forced the unprecedented closure of the city’s metro railway.  A branch of China Construction Bank (Asia) near Prince Edward train station was vandalized on Sunday with “No China” sprayed on its wall. A metro station in the nightlife district of Wan Chai had a sheet draped over it which read: “This way to HELL”.  Protesters set a fire at the Mong Kok MTR station, with a placard nearby reading: “If we burn, you burn with us”.  The current “precarious situation”, which endangered public safety, left no timely solution but the anti-mask law, Matthew Cheung, Hong Kong’s chief secretary, wrote on his blog on Sunday. He urged people to oppose violence ahead of grassroots district council elections set for Nov. 24.  Four months of protests have pushed the Asian financial hub to the brink of its first recession in a decade. Financial Secretary Paul Chan in a blog on Sunday said despite recent obstacles, the banking system remained sound and the financial market was functioning well.  “Hong Kong will not implement foreign exchange controls. The Hong Kong dollar can be exchanged freely and capital can come in and out freely. This is the solemn guarantee of the Basic Law,” said Chan. 	Reuters

Hundreds of anti-government protesters defied a ban on face masks and took to the streets across the Chinese-ruled city earlier in the day. But by evening they had largely dispersed in preparation for bigger marches planned for Sunday.  Rail operator MTR Corp suspended all services, paralyzing transport in the Asian financial hub, while malls and shops closed early after a night of chaos in which police shot a teenage boy and protesters torched businesses and metro stations.  Protests had erupted on Friday across the former British colony hours after its embattled leader, Carrie Lam, invoked colonial-era emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years to ban the use of face masks demonstrators have been using to hide their identities.  The night’s “extreme violence” justified the use of the emergency law, Beijing-backed Lam said in a television address on Saturday.  “The radical behavior of rioters took Hong Kong through a very dark night, leaving society today half-paralyzed,” she said in pre-recorded remarks.  “The extreme violence clearly illustrated that Hong Kong’s public safety is widely endangered. That’s the concrete reason that we had to invoke emergency law yesterday to introduce the anti-mask law.”  Undeterred by the ban and transport shutdown, several hundred pro-democracy protesters - many wearing masks - marched through the normally bustling shopping district of Causeway Bay on Saturday, but there was no repeat of Friday’s violence.   Other groups gathered in Sheung Shui close to the border with mainland China and in the busy shopping and tourist district of Tsim Sha Tsui.  “We felt we had to get out and show our basic right to wear a mask,” said one protester, Sue, 22, who wore a black mask and dark glasses to the Causeway Bay march.  “The government needs to learn it can’t squeeze Hong Kong people like this.”  The increasingly violent demonstrations that have roiled the city for four months began in opposition to a bill that would have allowed people to be extradited to mainland China for trial. They have since spiraled into a broader pro-democracy movement.  The unrest has plunged Hong Kong into its biggest political crisis since its handover from Britain to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that granted it autonomy and broad freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.  China’s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said on Friday the protests were evolving into a revolution backed by foreign forces and could not continue indefinitely.  The United Nations human rights chief called on Saturday for an independent probe into the violence seen during the protests.  Michelle Bachelet told a media conference in Kuala Lumpur the U.N. was: “alarmed by the injuries to the police and protesters, including journalists and protesters shot by law enforcement officers”.  MTR Corp shut its network, which carries about 5 million passengers a day, while shopping malls and supermarkets also closed in a blow for a city on the edge of recession.  “As we are no longer in a position to provide safe and reliable service to passengers in the circumstances, the corporation had no choice but to make the decision to suspend the service of its entire network,” MTR said in a statement.  Protesters had set fires at stations as well as to an empty train, and injured two staff, added MTR.  The airport express, one of the most popular routes to the airport, re-opened with a restricted service on Saturday, MTR said.  More than a dozen shopping malls, supermarkets, and branches of Bank of China (Hong Kong), Bank of East Asia, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which have been targeted by protesters, did not open on Saturday.  Shoppers formed long lines in supermarkets ahead of the expected closures.  Companies across Hong Kong, the Asian base for many global businesses, are increasingly walking a tightrope between the protesters and China’s Communist Party rulers in Beijing.  On Saturday, shoe brand Vans came under fire from Hong Kong internet users for removing from its website a design submitted in an online competition that showed Hong Kong protesters clad in yellow hard-hats.  In a statement, Vans said designs were removed “in line with our company’s long-held values of respect and tolerance, as well as our clearly communicated guidelines for this competition”.  The ban on face masks, which took effect on Saturday, was ordered under emergency laws that allow authorities to “make any regulations whatsoever” in what they deem to be the public interest.  The move enraged protesters, however, who took to the streets on Friday night to vent their anger, many wearing masks in open defiance. Some set fires, hurled petrol bombs at police and burned the Chinese national flag, in a direct challenge to authorities in Beijing.  Bachelet said on Saturday that face masks should not be used to provoke violence, but she warned Hong Kong against using the ban to target particular groups or curtail the right to freedom of assembly.  Police said an officer in Yuen Long, a district in the outlying New Territories that saw fierce clashes in July, had fired a shot in self-defense on Friday night after a protester threw a petrol bomb at him, setting him on fire.  Media said a 14-year-old boy was shot and the city’s Hospital Authority said his condition was now stable but gave no further details.  Also late on Friday, about 100 demonstrators besieged a branch of the Bank of China (Hong Kong) in the high-end shopping district of Causeway Bay, while across the harbor in the district of Kowloon, protesters smashed the glass store front of a China Life Insurance branch.  Police fired volleys of tear gas to disperse protesters in flashpoint districts such as Causeway Bay, Sha Tin and Wong Tai Sin, underscoring the challenges they face as protests show no sign of letting up.  Hospital authorities said 31 people were hurt in Friday’s protests, two of them seriously. 	Reuters

Hundreds of anti-government protesters defied a ban on face masks and took to the streets across the Chinese-ruled city earlier in the day. But by evening they had largely dispersed in preparation for bigger marches planned for Sunday.  Rail operator MTR Corp suspended all services, paralyzing transport in the Asian financial hub, while malls and shops closed early after a night of chaos in which police shot a teenage boy and protesters torched businesses and metro stations.  Protests had erupted on Friday across the former British colony hours after its embattled leader, Carrie Lam, invoked colonial-era emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years to ban the use of face masks demonstrators have been using to hide their identities.  The night’s “extreme violence” justified the use of the emergency law, Beijing-backed Lam said in a television address on Saturday.  “The radical behavior of rioters took Hong Kong through a very dark night, leaving society today half-paralyzed,” she said in pre-recorded remarks.  “The extreme violence clearly illustrated that Hong Kong’s public safety is widely endangered. That’s the concrete reason that we had to invoke emergency law yesterday to introduce the anti-mask law.”  Undeterred by the ban and transport shutdown, several hundred pro-democracy protesters - many wearing masks - marched through the normally bustling shopping district of Causeway Bay on Saturday, but there was no repeat of Friday’s violence.   Other groups gathered in Sheung Shui close to the border with mainland China and in the busy shopping and tourist district of Tsim Sha Tsui.  “We felt we had to get out and show our basic right to wear a mask,” said one protester, Sue, 22, who wore a black mask and dark glasses to the Causeway Bay march.  “The government needs to learn it can’t squeeze Hong Kong people like this.”  The increasingly violent demonstrations that have roiled the city for four months began in opposition to a bill that would have allowed people to be extradited to mainland China for trial. They have since spiraled into a broader pro-democracy movement.  The unrest has plunged Hong Kong into its biggest political crisis since its handover from Britain to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that granted it autonomy and broad freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.  China’s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said on Friday the protests were evolving into a revolution backed by foreign forces and could not continue indefinitely.  The United Nations human rights chief called on Saturday for an independent probe into the violence seen during the protests.  Michelle Bachelet told a media conference in Kuala Lumpur the U.N. was: “alarmed by the injuries to the police and protesters, including journalists and protesters shot by law enforcement officers”.

Two teenage protesters were shot while a journalist was permanently blinded in one eye in the past week during the worst outbreak of violence after four months of unrest in the Chinese-ruled city.        “We are troubled by the high levels of violence associated with some demonstrations... and also alarmed by the injuries to the police and protesters, including journalists and protesters shot by law enforcement officers,” U.N. High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet told a media conference in the Malaysian capital.     Hong Kong should immediately carry out an “effective, prompt, independent and impartial investigation” into acts of violence including the shootings, Bachelet said, adding that those responsible must face due process.       “I strongly condemn all acts of violence from all sides and I call all those responding to demonstrations and those engaged in protests to do so in a peaceful and non-violent way,” she said.  Hong Kong authorities imposed a ban on face masks on Saturday, a day after embattled leader Carrie Lam invoked colonial-era emergency powers in a bid to stem the violence.       In response to the ban, Bachelet said face masks should not be used to provoke violence but warned Hong Kong against using the ban to target particular groups or curtail the right to freedom of assembly.   “Freedom of peaceful assembly should be enjoyed without restriction to the greatest extent possible, but on the other hand, we cannot accept people who use masks to provoke violence,” she said.

Trump, speaking to reporters before departing the White House, said negotiations to end the U.S. trade war with China were separate from any investigation into Biden, whom Trump has accused of foreign corruption.   “One thing has nothing to do with the other,” the Republican president said when asked whether he would be more likely to make a deal with China if it investigated Biden. “I want to do a trade deal with China, but only if it’s good for our country.”  Top-level U.S.-China trade talks are scheduled to resume next Thursday and Friday, when Chinese Vice Premier Liu He meets with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Washington  The talks will be preceded on Monday and Tuesday by deputy-level discussions, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said earlier.  Trump has waged a two-year effort to change China’s trade, intellectual property and industrial policy practices, which he has long said are unfair and have cost millions of U.S. jobs.  His administration is seeking stronger protections of U.S. intellectual property, an end to forced transfers of American technology to Chinese firms, curbs to industrial subsidies and increased access to China’s largely closed domestic markets.  In a trade war that has lasted 15 months, the United States and China have heaped hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs   “I view China as somebody we’re trying to make a deal with, we have a very good chance of making a deal with,” Trump said.  Right now, we’re in a very important stage in terms of possibly making a deal. If we make it, it will be the biggest trade deal ever made.”    On Thursday Trump publicly urged Beijing to investigate Biden, a Democrat, again raising concerns that he has invited foreign interference in the U.S. presidential election. Last week Trump released a transcript of a call where he asked Ukraine’s president to also look into Biden, a request that has triggered an impeachment inquiry by House of Representatives Democrats.  Kudlow, in television interviews, held out hope for progress in opening China’s financial services markets to American companies in next week’s talks, adding the U.S. team was heading into them “open-minded.”  “Everything’s on the table, we’d love to go back to where we were in May when we were a lot closer,” Kudlow told Bloomberg TV.  The Trump trade team hoped to revisit a mostly agreed text from which China had backtracked in May, causing talks to break down, he said.   The text at that time included an agreement negotiated by Mnuchin that involved the lifting of foreign ownership caps on financial services firms in China.  “I’m not giving you news. I’m just saying we had some pretty good things last spring, like financial services opening - that could be extended,” Kudlow said in a subsequent interview on Fox Business Network. “I say ‘could’ and the president would have to sign off on it, but don’t rule out the possibility of good news.”  Kudlow declined to make any predictions about the talks but said there had been a “softening of the psychology on both sides” over the past month, with the United States delaying some tariff increases and China making some modest purchases of American farm products.  Kudlow also said the impeachment inquiry was unlikely to affect the trade talks with China.   “I don’t think that’s an impact right now. I think maybe it has only the tiniest, tiniest effect, maybe occasionally on stock market psychology,” Kudlow said.   However, he said the Trump administration continued to monitor freedom and democracy protests, which he said could have an impact on the talks, without specifying how. China-backed Hong Kong authorities have struggled to curb anti-government protests that have continued for four months.   	Reuters

By Peter Apps  LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - As Hong Kong recovered from its most violent day of protests so far, Beijing’s English-language “Global Times” newspaper led on the celebrations of 70 years of Communist rule. The celebrations, it argued, showed the peaceful intent and unity of Chinese society - illustrating the article with a picture of a new ballistic missile it said could drop nuclear warheads on any place on earth.  Overall, President Xi Jinping may well have been largely satisfied with the optics of this week’s celebrations, at least on mainland China. The last year, however, has been a particularly challenging one for the 66-year-old leader. The trade war with U.S. President Donald Trump has not just hurt China economically, but thrown into question the continuation of the entire model of globalization to which Beijing has tied its fortunes for 30 years.  Unrest in Hong Kong shows no signs of going away. It is not just an embarrassment to Chinese rule but has also dramatically shifted dynamics on Taiwan, which Beijing unapologetically wishes back under its control by the hundredth anniversary of China’s communist takeover in 2049.  The result is something of a paradox. China is by far the most powerful it has ever been, economically and militarily, and Xi himself has arguably also never been stronger. But a clear defensiveness, sometimes even bordering on paranoia, is coming into play. In his keynote speech on Tuesday, Xi warned that “no force can shake this great nation”. The implication, however, appeared to be that he expected some to try.  Certainly, Xi and those around him see protest in Hong Kong as a serious threat to their control both there and in mainland China, and are increasingly open about saying so. Having initially imposed an almost complete news blackout on events in the territory, Chinese media are now working overtime to paint events there as deliberate destruction verging on terrorism, criminality that must be crushed.  Whether they will send in troops is another matter, however, although the use of live rounds on Tuesday suggests police in Hong Kong will use greater force. Friday’s announcement banning the wearing of masks at protests could also dramatically escalate the confrontation.  Interestingly, Xi committed himself again to the “one country, two systems” arrangement for Hong Kong, suggesting that imposing direct rule from the mainland would be very much a last resort. The problem, however, is that Beijing has no real levers to stop the unrest beyond the use of force, and that to do so would be an admission of defeat and could usher in a humanitarian, diplomatic and economic catastrophe.  The controversial extradition law that initially sparked the protests, which would have seen Hong Kong citizens able to be taken to China against their will, has now been withdrawn. Offering any greater concessions, however, appears largely unthinkable to the mainland authorities, particularly demands for greater democracy or human rights. Xi and those who hope to succeed him will have no appetite whatsoever for such voices to build on the mainland, and will fear every concession in Hong Kong may encourage just that.  Certainly, the rest of Xi’s last decade at the top of Chinese politics demonstrates a sometimes brutal, often ruthlessly repressive and controlling style. Hundreds of senior officials and business leaders have vanished from public life as part of an anti-corruption crackdown that critics say was heavily aimed at removing rivals and keeping him in power. Activists and foreign governments say at least 1,000,000, perhaps considerably more, Muslim ethnic Uighurs are now held in camps in China’s Northwest. It is almost certainly the largest incarceration of a minority or ethnic group since the Holocaust.  Already, that increasingly repressive trend internally has emerged alongside a much more coercive, militarily assertive international approach, particularly in China’s immediate neighbourhood. China clearly continues to see its “soft power” – mainly the offer of investment – as a way of winning friends and influence through the One Belt, One Road scheme and beyond. What it appears to increasingly want in addition, however, is the ability to unambiguously threaten as well.  Retooling China’s nuclear arsenal is clearly part of that – as was showcasing it quite so clearly this week. Ever since acquiring nuclear arms in the sixties, Beijing has generally been content to have considerably smaller numbers of the weapons than other superpowers. Now, it clearly sees itself as an equal competitor, with the ability to strike over enormous distances on land and sea a clear part of his current strategy to protect itself - and, when necessary, intimidate others.  That’s already causing significant problems with relations with the Philippines, Vietnam and elsewhere – but nowhere more than Taiwan. A combination of military posturing and outrage on the island at events in Hong Kong has dramatically complicated Beijing’s hopes for ever closer political rapprochement, and may well make unification in the next 30 years outright impossible.  Therein, perhaps, lies the final irony. The more aggressive China gets, the more paranoid its leaders become and intensify their struggle for control, the harder Beijing may find it to get the things it wants. 	Reuters

The period during which these flows took place coincides with escalating anti-government protests and political unrest in the Chinese city.   Goldman’s report did not make any mention of the protests.  Modest net outflows from local currency deposits in Hong Kong and the net inflows of foreign currency deposits in Singapore in August could be the latest sign showing $3-4 billion left for the city state, the bank’s analysts said in a report on Monday.  “That said, the HK banking system still has ample liquidity in Hong Kong dollar as well as in foreign currencies,” though “this set of data is unlikely to allay investor concerns around outflows from HK,” they said.  Anti-government protests have gripped Hong Kong for four months with widespread violence this week as China, which resumed ruling the territory in 1997, celebrated the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic.   Hong Kong’s stockpile of deposits stood at HK$13.6 trillion  ($1.73 trillion) in August, according to Refinitiv Datastream.  But Hong Kong dollar deposits in the city dropped in August for the most in over a year while U.S. dollar savings surged. Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) insisted on Monday that the fluctuations were “normal”.  The central bank said the uptick in U.S. dollar deposits was driven by a “transfer of funds resulting in a higher amount of foreign-currency deposits placed by the Exchange Fund,” which backs Hong Kong’s currency peg with the greenback at 7.75-7.85.  Asked by Reuters about the reason behind this transfer, a HKMA spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Wednesday, that “in line with past practices, we do not comment on the details of our management of the Exchange Fund.”  The Hong Kong Dollar was trading largely flat at 7.8414 per dollar at 0514 GMT.

Activists went on the rampage in districts across the Chinese-ruled city late into the night, hurling petrol bombs, settting fires, blocking roads and vandalising some shops and metro stations as police fired tear gas to disperse them.  “Wherever there are protests nearby I’ll come ... I’m out tonight for a simple reason. You don’t shoot a teenager at point blank range,” said Alex Chan, an interior designer at a protest in the bustling shopping district of Causeway Bay.  “These protests will continue and we won’t give up.”  Thousands took to the streets on Wednesday to denounce the shooting of an 18-year-old secondary school student, which police said was an act of self-defence after the officer’s life came under serious threat.  The student was shot at point-blank range as he fought the officer with a metal pipe during violent protests on Tuesday, when demonstrators hurled petrol bombs at police who responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon.  Rail operator MTR Corp closed stations in districts including Po Lam, Hang Hau and Tseung Kwan O just before midnight on Wednesday as violence escalated once again.  Police said on Thursday the protesters’ acts “seriously undermined public order and posed a threat to the personal safety of police officers and members of the public.”  The former British colony has been rocked by months of protests over a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial, but have evolved into calls for democracy, among other demands.  The opposition to the Beijing-backed government has plunged the city into its biggest political crisis in decades and poses the gravest popular challenge to President Xi Jinping since he came to power.  Protesters are also angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city’s affairs despite a promise of autonomy in the “one country, two systems” formula under which Hong Kong returned to China in 1997.

After a freeze during months of sometimes violent protests, Asia’s top financial hub looks to be back in business. The stock market is off its lows, Hong Kong’s love affair with property is undimmed and companies are forging ahead with listing plans.            Budweiser Brewing Company APAC (1876.HK) raised about $5 billion in its initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, making it the second largest IPO in the world this year.   Bankers say at least three more major companies are set to list in Hong Kong this month, selling more than $3 billion worth of new shares.  Hong Kong’s status as a gateway for global capital flowing into and out of China, the world’s second-largest economy, has seen many global banks and fund managers make its towering skyscrapers their regional homes.      “How does this (unrest) affect you buying exposure to a good asset that has presence in China, and is growing? None of those things have any correlation with the Hong Kong protests,” said a senior banker with a global investment bank.  “I don’t think I have received even one phone call saying  ‘we shouldn’t be doing this IPO because of what’s happening in Hong Kong’,” said the banker, declining to be named due to sensitivity of the issue.  Companies raised $15 billion in new listings in Hong Kong in the first nine months of 2019, second only to New York, according to Refinitiv data.      While the protests have hurt tourism and retail sectors, threatening to send Hong Kong into its first recession in a decade, its proximity to the massive Chinese market and locally  listed firms’ presence there are more important, bankers and analysts say.  Already, the Hong Kong stock market has shown signs of steadying after initial falls as equity investors look for bargain hunting opportunities, they said.  The benchmark Hang Seng stock index .HSI rallied about 1.4% last month, but is still down 6.1% since mid-June when the unrest began.   “I think people are getting used to the weekly events,” Steven Leung, executive director for institutional sales at brokerage UOB Kay Hian, said of the protests.      “The impact was seen in the initial one to two months in share prices, and mostly in retail, property and tourism,” he said. “(But) the index mostly reflects onshore Chinese market and economy. Hong Kong companies’ share is not that big.”  What started as protests over a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial have evolved into broader calls for greater democracy, among other demands in Hong Kong.  Demonstrators are frustrated at what they see as Beijing’s tightening grip over the former British colony, which returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula intended to guarantee freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.  After the initial nervousness about the unrest, things are looking up again in the financial markets, partly aided by hopes that Beijing would not take any step that would imperil the prospects of its only offshore financial center, analysts said.  “The question is whether people think there is a replacement. Hong Kong still has quite a big investor pool,” said Gary Ng, an economist at Natixis.   As many as 40 companies have filed IPO applications with the Hong Kong stock exchange in September, according to information available on its website, the highest pace of filing since March this year.  In addition to the Budweiser APAC IPO, Topsports International Holdings, the sportswear business of Chinese footwear retailer Belle International, last week launched a Hong Kong IPO of up to $1.2 billion.    Companies expected to launch Hong Kong IPOs within a month include ESR Cayman Ltd, a developer and manager of logistics facilities, planning to raise about $1 billion, and a $1 billion-plus float of Prague-based consumer lender Home Credit.       ESR and Home Credit declined to comment.  “A deal can always get done if the price is right, no matter what the market conditions are,” said James Wang, co-head of equity capital markets in Asia ex-Japan, at Goldman Sachs, referring to the broader IPO market.        “An IPO’s timetable is driven more by the company’s need to raise capital so in most cases, market conditions have to be severe to override that need and delay a deal.”  Investors including sovereign wealth funds and large global funds that invested in recent offerings are enthused by the lower valuations as well as long term business prospects, bankers said.   Budweiser, which relaunched its IPO last month after cancelling plans for a bigger float in July, priced the offering at the low end of the indicative range.  E-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA.N) in August also delayed plans for a $15 billion listing in Hong Kong because of the political turmoil.   But such caution has not badly dented the demand for new and listed stocks.   In another sign of solid demand, net purchases on southbound stock connect that allows mainland-based investors to buy Hong Kong stocks - reached $8 billion in August, the most since January 2018.      Other markets in Hong Kong are also holding up.  Demand from homebuyers in the world’s most expensive property market has shown little signs of weakening due to the protests.      Property firm Wheelock (0020.HK) sold 80% of its 816 flats in the development since late August, lower than sales at other launches this year, but “still good” given the current environment, property agents said.  Still, other factors including the U.S.-Sino trade war and slowing global growth have been affecting financial markets and asset prices in Hong Kong, as they have elsewhere.   Sean Taylor, APAC chief investment officer at fund manager DWS said Hong Kong could benefit more than most if China and the United States reach an agreement on trade. In the meantime, investors needed to be patient.  “You’ve got to accept the situation that tourism levels are down, retail sales are down, property prices may come down a bit – you’re going to be in a slow environment for a while,” Taylor said.

The FTSE 100 plunged 3.2% to its lowest level in more than a month and the domestically-focused FTSE 250 dropped just shy of 2%, close to a one-month low.  Losses were seen across the board on both indexes as investors grappled with a deepening Brexit crisis and fears of a global slowdown amid heightened transatlantic trade tensions, while weak U.S. private payrolls data also added to those fears.  “The declines now appear to be accelerating on rising concern that the ongoing deterioration in the manufacturing numbers will at some point start to manifest itself in the much larger services sector,” CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said.  At home, Prime Minister Boris Johnson tabled a ‘final Brexit offer’ to the European Union and warned that unless the bloc compromised, Britain would leave without a deal at the end of this month.  “The prospect of a no-deal Brexit is weighing on financial stocks, as the Bank of England is likely to cut rates should that occur,” CMC Markets analyst David Madden said, adding that banks’ margins could be squeezed in that scenario.  HSBC, which has also been weakened by the Hong Kong protests, fell 2.7%. The global bank dragged on the blue-chip index along with oil majors BP and Shell, which tracked losses in crude prices.  Souring the already fear-stricken mood, the World Trade Organization authorized the U.S. to apply tariffs worth $7.5 billion annually on the European Union, including the UK, over illegal EU subsidies handed to Airbus.  In a sea of red, the only green shoot was Flutter Entertainment, which jumped 7% after agreeing to an all-share deal with Poker Stars owner. Shares of mid-cap rival William Hill added 3.6% on the M&A news.  Tesco, Britain’s No. 1 retailer, ended marginally higher after rising as much as 2.3% on better-than-expected earnings. Shares had opened lower after the surprise resignation of its Chief Executive Officer Dave Lewis.  “He will certainly be a hard act to follow, given that under his guidance he pulled Tesco back from the precipice,” Hewson said.

Hong Kong, which ranks among the world’s top five luxury destinations, has long been a magnet for brands attracted by the flow of visitors from mainland China. The city accounts for between 5% and 10% of the estimated $285 billion annual global sales of luxury goods, according to Bernstein analysts.  But data on Wednesday showed retail sales had fallen 23% in August from a year earlier - the biggest decline on record - while the value of sales of jewellery, watches and other valuable items decreased by 47.4%.    Visitor arrivals dropped 39%, with the number of mainland tourists to Hong Kong falling 42.3%.   “We don’t see any light at the end of the tunnel,” said the chair of Hong Kong Retail Management Association, Annie Yau Tse.   After the pro-democracy demonstrations started in June, the impact on second quarter results was muted, but that is expected to change in third quarter results as brands from Hermes to Tiffany grapple with store closures.   RBC analyst Rogerio Fujimori, who has just visited Hong Kong, estimates most brands will suffer sales declines of between 30% to 60% in the third quarter. Bain & Co now sees the global luxury sector growing this year at the low end of the 4% to 6% range, said analyst Claudia D’Arpizio.   Watchmakers in particular are likely to be hurt – Hong Kong is a major center for high-end timepieces – and Switzerland’s Swatch Group (UHR.S) and Cartier-owner Richemont CFRS. rely on Hong Kong for 11 to 12% of their global sales.     Around 30 major shopping malls had to shut down during anti-government protests which turned violent on October 1, marring celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.  The closures come during the annual Golden Week holiday – usually one of the busiest periods for retailers in the city.  “Business has obviously been very affected. We were losing lots of sales and now the closures make it harder. It’s much harder for us to get customers,” a Gucci salesperson at the brand’s store in the Pacific Place shopping mall told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.  U.S. jeweller Tiffany, which counts Hong Kong as its fourth biggest market, has said the impact on its business has been material although it has invested in new shops - both in Hong Kong and mainland China - which it hopes will help counter some of the disruption to its sales.   “The traffic in shopping malls is nowhere where it used to be, and we are also struggling sometimes to keep our stores open,” CEO Alessandro Bogliolo told Reuters in late August.  France’s Hermes (HRMS.PA), which makes $10,000-plus leather Birkin handbags, said in September it had been forced to temporarily shut some of its five stores as well as an airport shop in Hong Kong.   Chanel put a fashion show planned for Nov. 6 to present its “Cruise” collection on hold, saying it would happen at a “later and more appropriate moment.”   But most companies are not rethinking their business plans more drastically yet and Tiffany went ahead with the opening of its One Peking Road flagship store in September as planned.   Some luxury brands, like LVMH (LVMH.PA), are likely to be able to absorb the hit thanks to rising demand in mainland China and other Asian countries - Hermes has already said as much.  LVMH, which makes around 6% of its revenue in Hong Kong, kicks off the industry’s reporting season on Oct. 9. It declined to comment on the impact from the protests so far.    Its big sales drivers like handbag maker Louis Vuitton or fashion label Christian Dior have been enjoying strong demand in recent months from mainland China, echoing trends at Kering’s (PRTP.PA) powerhouse Gucci.   Lots of rich Chinese tourists are going on shopping trips to Japan instead of Hong Kong, an industry source said. South Korea, Australia and Singapore are also benefiting from Hong Kong’s decline, analysts say.  Chinese customers have also been encouraged to shop at home by the government’s import tariff and VAT cuts.     But some brands in turnaround mode, including Italy’s Tod’s (TOD.MI) or even recovering fashion label Prada (1913.HK), have not seen as big a bounce on the mainland as LVMH or Hermes.  “For those groups that have a well developed retail network across Asia, the Hong Kong protests do not necessarily mean losing money,” said Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein.   As an example, Solca said that winter jacket maker Moncler (MONC.MI), whose CEO Remo Ruffini sounded a cautious note on the group’s outlook for 2019 because of the turmoil, had about 30% fewer stores in mainland China than Gucci or Vuitton.  Luxury goods in Hong Kong are also cheaper than in mainland China - in the case of fashion, the price can halve.   “Some Chinese could decide to buy fewer items - or just wait for the protest to end, whenever that might be,” Solca said.   In the meantime luxury firms are asking Hong Kong landlords to cut their sky-high rents.  Local press reports say Prada plans to quit its 1,400 square meter store right in the retail heart of Hong Kong next year because of dwindling sales. Jefferies analysts said the landlord of that building is negotiating a 44% cut in rental costs. Prada declined to comment.      All major brands are trying to renegotiate rental terms, according to a second industry source, as they look to cushion themselves from the impact of the protests. 	Reuters

Protesters took aim at some of China’s largest banks at the weekend, spray-painting anti-China slogans on shuttered branches  and trashing ATM machines of outlets such as Bank of China’s Hong unit (2388.HK), while nearby international counterparts such as Standard Chartered (STAN.L) escaped untouched.  Another target was shops operated by Maxim’s Caterers, including American coffee chain Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), after the daughter of the Hong Kong company’s founder condemned the protesters at the United Nations human rights council in Geneva.  Demonstrators scrawled anti-China graffiti on several Starbucks outlets, including in the bustling tourist and business districts of Causeway Bay and Admiralty.  Protesters’ growing anger toward the local branches of Chinese banks comes at a bad time for the lenders, as their businesses are also expected to take a hit from the city’s economy facing its first recession in a decade.  Hong Kong had 22 licensed banks from mainland China in 2018, the most number of banks from any country, according to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The mainland banks accounted for 37% of total Hong Kong banking assets last year.           In the past few days, as thousands of protesters marched through the heart of the financial center, a small group of black-clad protesters frantically pasted posters and spray-painted expletives on shuttered branches of Chinese banks.  In the commercial and night life district of Wan Chai on Sunday, a branch of China CITIC Bank International, the offshore banking arm of conglomerate CITIC Group, was plastered with posters of protesters’ demands to the government. A StanChart bank branch next door was untouched.   “This protest is against China’s efforts to restrict our freedom, and we will target all the pro-China business groups who don’t speak out against that,” said IT professional Ronald, as he plastered a poster on the closed glass door of the bank.  Also on Sunday, a group of protesters tried to smash cameras over ATMs of Bank of China Hong Kong branch in Wan Chai and spray-painted machine screens, while on Tuesday they threw petrol bombs at the shuttered branch of Nanyang Commercial Bank.  On Wednesday, Bank of China Hong Kong said two of its city branches would remain closed due to vandalism. In a separate Chinese statement, the bank expressed its “deepest anger over the illegal violent behaviour”.  Anti-government protests turned violent early on Tuesday and continued into the night, with intense cat-and-mouse skirmishes marring celebrations in Beijing to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.  The targeting of the banks in Hong Kong comes weeks after a group of protesters ran online campaigns urging people in Hong Kong to withdraw money from the Hong Kong branches of the Chinese lenders.         “This protest is sparked because the Hong Kong government and the PRC (People’s Republic of China) keep curbing our freedom and our core values,” said Chan, a 25-year-old accountant and protester.   “The vandalism and damage to the Chinese bank actually also reflects the fact that we don’t want our assets and freedom being kept by the Chinese authority. It has a symbolic meaning which is the same as the proposal of money withdrawal.”  Companies across Hong Kong, the Asian base for many global businesses, are walking a tightrope between the protesters and China’s Communist Party rulers in Beijing.   Cathay Pacific Airways (0293.HK) became the biggest corporate casualty when China demanded in August that it suspend staff involved in the protest movement that has plunged Hong Kong into its biggest political crisis in decades.  At least 20 pilots and cabin crew have since been fired, the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions has said. 	Reuters

415	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1WG4WG	October 1, 2019 /  10:09 PM / 6 months ago	Police shoot teen protester as Hong Kong violence escalates	HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police shot a teenage protester on Tuesday, the first  to be hit by live ammunition in almost four months of unrest in the Chinese-ruled city, amid violent clashes on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic.  Cat-and-mouse clashes spread from the shopping district of Causeway Bay to the Admiralty area of government offices on Hong Kong island, and then on to the New Territories bordering mainland China, with police firing tear gas and water cannon at petrol bomb throwing activists.  Police said an officer shot an 18-year-old man in the shoulder in the Tsuen Wan area of the New Territories with a live round. Protesters have previously been hit with bean bags rounds and rubber bullets and officers have fired live rounds in the air.  Police chief Stephen Lo said the firing of live rounds - which were discharged in three places - was lawful and fair.  “Police lives were under serious threat, that’s why they fired live rounds,” he told reporters, adding that the wounded man was conscious when taken to hospital.  Dramatic video footage of the Tsuen Wan shooting shows a chaotic melee with riot police battling protesters wielding metal bars, before an officer fires a shot at close range.  As the wounded man steps back and falls, someone tries to help, but another policeman tackles him to the ground.  Tuesday’s violence was the most widespread since the unrest erupted in early June, plunging the former British colony into its biggest political crisis in decades and posing the most serious popular challenge to President Xi Jinping since he came to power.  Protesters had vowed to seize the opportunity on China’s National Day to propel their calls for greater democracy onto the international stage, hijacking an occasion Beijing sees as an opportunity to showcase China’s economic and military progress.  “I’m not young, but if we don’t march now, we’ll never have the chance to speak again, it’s as simple as that,” said one marcher near Causeway Bay, a 42-year-old woman with her own logistics company who identified herself as Li.  Setting the scene for confrontations, thousands of black-clad protesters, some wearing Guy Fawkes masks, had marched on Admiralty, defying a police ban. Violence escalated across the harbor to Kowloon and beyond to the New Territories.  In the Admiralty area, police fired water cannon and volley after volley of tear gas to disperse protesters throwing Molotov cocktails outside central government offices and ordered the evacuation of the Legislative Council building next door.  Petrol bombs were also thrown at MTR metro stations, including at Causeway Bay and Admiralty and Sham Shui Po in the New Territories. Many stations were closed to stop protesters moving around.  Chinese banks and Chinese-backed businesses were targeted with petrol bombs and anti-China graffiti. Local broadcaster RTHK said it was pulling all its reporters away from the violence after one was hit on the head.  Police said 31 people had been wounded across the territory, two critically, without giving details.  Protester Jerry, 26, dressed in black and sitting amid the wreckage in Causeway Bay, denounced the police.  “The Hong Kong police, they’ve just lost their minds,” he told Reuters. “They just follow orders. They say it’s to protect lives, but they see the people as objects.”  British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab criticized the use of live ammunition.  “Whilst there is no excuse for violence, the use of live ammunition is disproportionate, and only risks inflaming the situation,” Raab said in a statement.  A United Nations spokesman called for protests to be peaceful and security forces to exercise restraint.      Hong Kong has been tense for weeks, with protests often turning violent, as authorities tried to avoid activists spoiling Beijing’s birthday parade.   Hundreds of officials and members of Hong Kong’s pro-establishment elite began the day with a flag-raising ceremony and National Day reception at the Convention and Exhibition Centre, held early and moved behind closed doors. Roads to the center were closed and tightly policed.  Hong Kong had benefited from China’s support under the “one country, two systems” policy, Acting Chief Executive Matthew Cheung told the assembly, referring to guarantees of political freedoms after the city’s handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997.  But he said escalating violence was disrupting social order and hurting the economy.  The government of embattled leader Carrie Lam has already canceled an annual Oct. 1 fireworks display over the city’s Victoria Harbour, citing public safety.  Lam, who was trapped in a stadium for hours last week after attending the “open dialogue”, left for Beijing on Monday to celebrate China’s birthday on the mainland.  In contrast to events in Hong Kong, Beijing’s carefully choreographed anniversary festivities included troops marching through part of Tiananmen Square with new missiles and floats celebrating the country’s technological prowess.  Lam was shown on television smiling as a float celebrating Hong Kong went past as she sat with Chinese officials.    The Communist Party leadership is determined to project an image of national strength and unity in the face of challenges including Hong Kong’s unrest.  “On our journey forward, we must uphold the principles of peaceful reunification and one country, two systems; maintain lasting prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macau ... and continue to strive for the motherland’s complete reunification,” Xi said in a nationally televised speech in Beijing.  The protests were initially triggered by a contentious extradition bill, now withdrawn, that would have allowed people to be sent from Hong Kong to mainland China for trial, but have since morphed into a much wider campaign.  Hong Kong protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in the Asian financial center.  China dismisses the accusation and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment. 	Reuters

417	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1WG3XO	October 1, 2019 /  12:57 PM / 6 months ago	Key dates in Hong Kong's protests	HONG KONG (Reuters) - A young demonstrator was shot and police fired tear gas and water cannon at petrol-bomb throwing protesters, as violence flared in Hong Kong as the city’s Chinese rulers celebrated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic.  Tuesday’s unrest was the most widespread in nearly four months of street clashes and demonstrations that have plunged the former British colony into its biggest political crisis in decades and pose the most serious popular challenge to China’s President Xi Jinping since he came to power.  Protests were sparked in June by planned legislation that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China. The bill was later withdrawn, but the protests have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement.  Following is a timeline of the key dates around the extradition bill and the protests it triggered:  February 2019 – Hong Kong’s Security Bureau submits a paper to the city’s legislature proposing amendments to extradition laws that would provide for case-by-case extraditions to countries, including mainland China, beyond the 20 states with which Hong Kong already has treaties.  March 31 - Thousands take to the streets of Hong Kong to protest against the proposed extradition bill.   April 3 – Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam’s government introduces amendments to Hong Kong’s extradition laws that would allow criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial.   April 28 – Tens of thousands of people march on Hong Kong’s city assembly building, the Legislative Council, to demand the scrapping of the proposed amendments to the extradition laws.  May 11 – Scuffles break out in Hong Kong’s legislature between pro-democracy lawmakers and those loyal to Beijing over the extradition bill.  May 21 – Lam says her administration is determined to push the bill through the legislature.  May 30 – Hong Kong introduces concessions to the extradition bill, including limiting the scope of extraditable offences. Critics say they are not enough.   June 6 – More than 3,000 Hong Kong lawyers take to the streets dressed in black in a rare protest march against the extradition law.   June 9 - More than half a million take to the streets in protest.   June 12 – Police fire rubber bullets and tear gas during the city’s largest and most violent protests in decades. Government offices are shut for the rest of the week.  June 15 – Lam indefinitely delays the proposed extradition law.  July 1 - Protesters storm the Legislative Council on the 22nd anniversary of the handover from British to Chinese rule, destroying pictures and daubing walls with graffiti.  July 9 - Lam says the extradition bill is dead and that government work on the legislation had been a “total failure”.  July 21 - Men, clad in white T-shirts and some armed with poles, flood into rural Yuen Long station and storm a train, attacking passengers and passers-by, including members of the media, after several thousand activists surrounded China’s representative office in the city earlier in the day, and clashed with police.   July 30 - Forty-four activists are charged with rioting, the first time this charge has been used during these protests.   Aug. 9 - China’s aviation regulator demands Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific suspend personnel who have taken part in the protests. The airline suspends a pilot, one of 44 charged with rioting the month before, the next day.  Aug. 14 - Police and protesters clash at Hong Kong’s international airport after flights were disrupted for a second day. The airport resumed operations later that day, rescheduling hundreds of flights.   Aug. 21 - China’s biggest e-commerce company Alibaba delays its up to $15 billion listing in Hong Kong, initially set for late August.   Sept. 2 - Lam says she has caused “unforgivable havoc” by igniting the political crisis engulfing the city and would quit if she had a choice, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters of remarks she made to a group of businesspeople.  Sept. 3 - Lam says she had never asked the Chinese government to let her resign to end the city’s political crisis, responding to the Reuters report.  Sept. 4 - Lam announces formal withdrawal of controversial extradition bill. Critics say it is too little, too late.  Sept. 7 - Police fire tear gas for a second consecutive night after fending off airport protests.  Sept. 8 - Security forces fire tear gas to disperse protesters in upmarket Causeway Bay shopping district.  Sept. 17 - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam pledges to hold talks with the community to try to ease tensions.  Sept. 22 - Hong Kong police fire tear gas to break up pro-democracy demonstrators who trashed fittings at a railway station and shopping mall.  Sept. 26 - Hong Kong protesters trap city leader Carrie Lam in a stadium for hours after she holds her first “open dialogue” with the people.  Oct. 1 - City rocked by the most widespread unrest since the start of the protests, as China’s Communist Party rulers celebrate 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic. 	Reuters

Following is a timeline of the key dates around the extradition bill and the protests it triggered:  February 2019 – Hong Kong’s Security Bureau submits a paper to the city’s legislature proposing amendments to extradition laws that would provide for case-by-case extraditions to countries, including mainland China, beyond the 20 states with which Hong Kong already has treaties.  March 31 - Thousands take to the streets of Hong Kong to protest against the proposed extradition bill.   April 3 – Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam’s government introduces amendments to Hong Kong’s extradition laws that would allow criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial.   April 28 – Tens of thousands of people march on Hong Kong’s city assembly building, the Legislative Council, to demand the scrapping of the proposed amendments to the extradition laws.  May 11 – Scuffles break out in Hong Kong’s legislature between pro-democracy lawmakers and those loyal to Beijing over the extradition bill.  May 21 – Lam says her administration is determined to push the bill through the legislature.  May 30 – Hong Kong introduces concessions to the extradition bill, including limiting the scope of extraditable offences. Critics say they are not enough.   June 6 – More than 3,000 Hong Kong lawyers take to the streets dressed in black in a rare protest march against the extradition law.   June 9 - More than half a million take to the streets in protest.   June 12 – Police fire rubber bullets and tear gas during the city’s largest and most violent protests in decades. Government offices are shut for the rest of the week.  June 15 – Lam indefinitely delays the proposed extradition law.  July 1 - Protesters storm the Legislative Council on the 22nd anniversary of the handover from British to Chinese rule, destroying pictures and daubing walls with graffiti.  July 9 - Lam says the extradition bill is dead and that government work on the legislation had been a “total failure”.  July 21 - Men, clad in white T-shirts and some armed with poles, flood into rural Yuen Long station and storm a train, attacking passengers and passers-by, including members of the media, after several thousand activists surrounded China’s representative office in the city earlier in the day, and clashed with police.   July 30 - Forty-four activists are charged with rioting, the first time this charge has been used during these protests.   Aug. 9 - China’s aviation regulator demands Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific suspend personnel who have taken part in the protests. The airline suspends a pilot, one of 44 charged with rioting the month before, the next day.  Aug. 14 - Police and protesters clash at Hong Kong’s international airport after flights were disrupted for a second day. The airport resumed operations later that day, rescheduling hundreds of flights.   Aug. 21 - China’s biggest e-commerce company Alibaba delays its up to $15 billion listing in Hong Kong, initially set for late August.   Sept. 2 - Lam says she has caused “unforgivable havoc” by igniting the political crisis engulfing the city and would quit if she had a choice, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters of remarks she made to a group of businesspeople.  Sept. 3 - Lam says she had never asked the Chinese government to let her resign to end the city’s political crisis, responding to the Reuters report.  Sept. 4 - Lam announces formal withdrawal of controversial extradition bill. Critics say it is too little, too late.  Sept. 7 - Police fire tear gas for a second consecutive night after fending off airport protests.

The footage, taken by students during a chaotic melee in the Tsuen Wan area of the city, is the first known instance of a protester being shot with live ammunition during weeks of clashes between police and pro-democracy campaigners.  Police confirmed that an officer opened fire at a protester, saying he was acting in self-defense.  “A large group of rioters was attacking police officers in Tsuen Wan,” police said in a statement.  “Police officers warned them, but they were still attacking police. A police officer’s life was seriously endangered. In order to save his and other officers’ lives, they fired at the attacker.”  One clip posted on social media and verified by Reuters shows the protester, an as yet unnamed 18-year-old man, swing a baton at a policeman, brushing his right arm.  When the footage is slowed down, a white flash appears at the end of the pistol barrel pointing at the protester’s chest from around a meter away. The protester stumbles over another policeman and falls on his back.  A second protester wearing a yellow construction hat rushes to the wounded man’s aid before being tackled to the ground by police.  After lying motionless for several moments, the wounded protester removes his gas mask and calls weakly for help, giving his name and saying his chest hurts and that he needs to go to hospital. A policeman then kneels beside him and begins to tend to his wound.  Protesters have been hit before with bean bags and rubber bullets and officers have fired live rounds in the air.  The incident came as thousands of protesters, some wearing Guy Fawkes masks, took to the streets to defy the city’s Chinese rulers on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic.

Police fired water cannon and tear gas to try to disperse protesters throwing petrol bombs outside central government offices in the Admiralty area of Hong Kong island and ordered the evacuation of the Legislative Council building, trashed by activists weeks ago, next door.  In the New Territories town of Sha Tin, police fired tear gas canisters directly at high-rise windows, though it was not clear why, as the Chinese-ruled city was gripped by the most widespread violence in nearly four months of unrest.  Police said “rioters” had used corrosive fluid in Tuen Mun in the west of the New Territories, “injuring multiple police officers and reporters”. No details were immediately available.  The Chinese-ruled territory has been tense for weeks, with protests often turning violent, as authorities scramble to avoid activists spoiling Beijing’s birthday parade at a time when the central government is already grappling with a U.S.-China trade war and a slowing economy.    Peaceful protests descended into chaos with police firing volleys of tear gas outside a famous Taoist temple in the residential district of Wong Tai Sin. At least eight motor-cycles were torched.  Nearly four months of street clashes and demonstrations have plunged the former British colony into its biggest political crisis in decades and pose the gravest popular challenge to President Xi since he came to power.  Thousands of black-clad protesters, some wearing Guy Fawkes masks, marched from Causeway Bay toward government headquarters in Admiralty, defying a ban on a rally and setting up the likelihood of clashes with police.  Rail operator MTR Corp shut down its whole metro system to stop protesters moving around. Shutting stations has made it a common target for attack, with several of its stations trashed over recent weeks.   Protesters had vowed to seize the opportunity on China’s National Day to propel their calls for greater democracy onto the international stage, hijacking an occasion Beijing sees as an opportunity to showcase China’s economic and military progress.  Demonstrators blocked roads across the territory in frantic game of cat-and-mouse with police, piling pressure on already stretched security resources.  “I’m not young, but if we don’t march now, we’ll never have the chance to speak to again, it’s as simple as that,” said one marcher near Causeway Bay, a 42-year-old woman with her own logistics company who identified herself as Li.  Police said they arrested five people, aged between 17 and 25, in the central district of Wan Chai late on Monday after finding them with walkie-talkies, lighters and material for petrol bombs, including 18 liters (4.75 gallons) of fuel and empty bottles.   Hundreds of officials and members of the pro-establishment elite began the day with a flag-raising ceremony and National Day reception at the Convention and Exhibition Centre, held early and moved behind closed doors. Roads to the center were closed and tightly policed.  Hong Kong has benefited from China’s support under the “one country, two systems” policy, Acting Chief Executive Matthew Cheung told the assembly, referring to guarantees of political freedoms after the city’s handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997.  However, he said escalating violence was disrupting social order and hurting the economy.  The IFC mall, one of the city’s largest upscale shopping centers, was closed on Tuesday, depriving retailers of sales in what would normally be a busy shopping week when mainland tour groups traditionally flood in for the annual Golden Week holiday.  IFC houses an Apple Inc (AAPL.O) store, jewelers Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) and Chow Sang Sang (0016.HK), cosmetics maker L’Occitane (0973.HK) and Gucci, which is owned by French group Kering (PRTP.PA).   Standard & Poor’s cut its Hong Kong economic growth forecast on Tuesday to a paltry 0.2 percent for this year and 1.6 percent for 2020, blaming tension in the city for the plunging retail sales and a sharp dip in tourism. Its last forecast in July was for 2.2 percent growth this year and 2.4 percent for 2020.   Visitor arrivals dropped 39% in August from a year earlier, with the number of mainland tourists to Hong Kong dropping 42.3% over the period, according to the latest data.    Cheung called a first “open dialogue” last week with citizens an important step and said more would follow.  A group of protesters outside the venue shouted “No national day celebrations, only national day mourning”, and called for those arrested during recent clashes to be released. Police fired pepper spray during a scuffle outside a nearby train station.  The government of embattled leader Carrie Lam has already canceled an annual Oct. 1 fireworks display over the city’s Victoria Harbour, citing public safety.  Lam, who was trapped in a stadium for hours last week after attending the “open dialogue”, left for Beijing on Monday to celebrate China’s birthday on the mainland. She will return on Tuesday.  In contrast to events in Hong Kong, Beijing’s carefully choreographed anniversary festivities included troops marching through part of Tiananmen Square with new missiles and floats celebrating the country’s technological prowess.  Lam was shown on television smiling as a float celebrating Hong Kong went past as she sat with Chinese officials.    The Communist Party leadership is determined to project an image of national strength and unity in the face of challenges including Hong Kong’s unrest, slowing economic growth and a trade war with the United States.  “On our journey forward, we must uphold the principles of peaceful reunification and one country, two systems; maintain lasting prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macau ... and continue to strive for the motherland’s complete reunification,” Xi said in his nationally televised speech in Beijing.  Hong Kong protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in the Asian financial center.  China dismisses the accusation and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.  Last month, Beijing moved thousands of troops across the border into the city. The Xinhua state news agency described the movement as routine rotation.  Asian and Western envoys in Hong Kong, however, have said the absence of any evidence that troops had been withdrawn suggested it was a reinforcement, with the largest-ever regular army force now stationed in the city.

Cat-and-mouse clashes spread from the shopping district of Causeway Bay to the Admiralty area of government offices on Hong Kong island, and then on to the New Territories bordering mainland China, with police firing tear gas and water cannon at petrol bomb throwing activists.  Police said an officer shot an 18-year-old man in the shoulder in the Tsuen Wan area of the New Territories with a live round. Protesters have previously been hit with bean bags rounds and rubber bullets and officers have fired live rounds in the air.  Police chief Stephen Lo said the firing of live rounds - which were discharged in three places - was lawful and fair.  “Police lives were under serious threat, that’s why they fired live rounds,” he told reporters, adding that the wounded man was conscious when taken to hospital.  Dramatic video footage of the Tsuen Wan shooting shows a chaotic melee with riot police battling protesters wielding metal bars, before an officer fires a shot at close range.  As the wounded man steps back and falls, someone tries to help, but another policeman tackles him to the ground.  Tuesday’s violence was the most widespread since the unrest erupted in early June, plunging the former British colony into its biggest political crisis in decades and posing the most serious popular challenge to President Xi Jinping since he came to power.  Protesters had vowed to seize the opportunity on China’s National Day to propel their calls for greater democracy onto the international stage, hijacking an occasion Beijing sees as an opportunity to showcase China’s economic and military progress.  “I’m not young, but if we don’t march now, we’ll never have the chance to speak again, it’s as simple as that,” said one marcher near Causeway Bay, a 42-year-old woman with her own logistics company who identified herself as Li.  Setting the scene for confrontations, thousands of black-clad protesters, some wearing Guy Fawkes masks, had marched on Admiralty, defying a police ban. Violence escalated across the harbor to Kowloon and beyond to the New Territories.  In the Admiralty area, police fired water cannon and volley after volley of tear gas to disperse protesters throwing Molotov cocktails outside central government offices and ordered the evacuation of the Legislative Council building next door.  Petrol bombs were also thrown at MTR metro stations, including at Causeway Bay and Admiralty and Sham Shui Po in the New Territories. Many stations were closed to stop protesters moving around.  Chinese banks and Chinese-backed businesses were targeted with petrol bombs and anti-China graffiti. Local broadcaster RTHK said it was pulling all its reporters away from the violence after one was hit on the head.  Police said 31 people had been wounded across the territory, two critically, without giving details.  Protester Jerry, 26, dressed in black and sitting amid the wreckage in Causeway Bay, denounced the police.  “The Hong Kong police, they’ve just lost their minds,” he told Reuters. “They just follow orders. They say it’s to protect lives, but they see the people as objects.”  British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab criticized the use of live ammunition.  “Whilst there is no excuse for violence, the use of live ammunition is disproportionate, and only risks inflaming the situation,” Raab said in a statement.  A United Nations spokesman called for protests to be peaceful and security forces to exercise restraint.      Hong Kong has been tense for weeks, with protests often turning violent, as authorities tried to avoid activists spoiling Beijing’s birthday parade.

China and Europe have halted the global stocks rally, oil has cooled dramatically and rising recession worries have sent gold and government bonds charging again.  Perhaps it was to be expected after such a flying start to the year, but the deterioration in risk appetite has included some eye-catching milestones.   The switch back into support mode by the top global central banks has swollen the amount of bonds trading at negative rates — where investors pay rather than get paid to lend — to a record $17 trillion.  Over 3.5% returns on U.S. Treasuries following the first Federal Reserve rate cuts since the financial crisis mean they are now having their best year since 2011 while calmer politics and ECB stimulus have given Italian bond markets their best quarter since Mario Draghi’s 2012 “whatever it takes” vow.   “The shear size of the (bond) rally was quite impressive,” said Hans Peterson, global head of asset allocation at SEB Investment Management. “And quite surprising,” he added considering how low bond yields were already.   There has been much more divergence in equity and foreign exchange markets.   On one hand, Wall Street's S&P 500 has added another 1% to its 19% H1 surge .SPX, Japan's Nikkei is up 2.4% .N225 and Turkey's battered stock market has bounced back almost 12% after torrid last 18 months. .XU100  In the drop zone though, Hong Kong’s protests saw the Hang Seng .HKI lose 9% in its worst quarter in four years and plenty of emerging markets from South Africa to Saudi Arabia have buckled badly too.  MSCI’s all country world index .MIWD00000PUS, which now tracks around 2,700 stocks in 49 countries is set for its first quarterly dip of the year but a near 2% rebound this month has limited the damage to a modest 0.5%.  A weaker yuan CNH= means China's big bourses are down as well in dollar terms despite Beijing's stimulus efforts in the face of the trade war. But then again so too are London .FTSE, Frankfurt .GDAXI and Paris .FCHI in Europe.   The dollar is up over 3% against a basket of top global currencies but sterling’s additional Brexit worries mean it is down a bit more and the euro is more than 4% lower after the ECB’s cut its interest into even more negative territory.    (GRAPHIC - Global markets third quarter and year-to-date: here)  It's been the worst quarter for the Australian dollar, meanwhile, since the end of 2016 as its China-sensitive economy has spluttered while 6.5% has been lopped off its Antipodean cousin, the New Zealand dollar NZD=D4 AUD=D4.   “The U.S. dollar has been very strong really against everything,” explained head of currencies at State Street Global Advisors, James Binny, citing global factors like the trade war.  “It is getting to the point where it is quite expensive. As with anything it is difficult to pick the turning point, but it’s like a stretched rubber band — the more you stretch it the stronger the forces that bring it back.”  Among commodities there has been a big split too, but there it has been between what’s precious and what’s not.   Safe-haven gold is up 4.5% XAU= and is now on its longest quarterly winning streak since 2011 having been rising since Q4 2018. Equally precious palladium XPD= meanwhile is up for a  sixth straight quarter - its best run since 2000.   Industrial bellwether and China proxy copper MCU3=LX is at the other end of the spectrum. The red metal is down for a sixth quarter in the last seven. It has been black for oil too - it is down over 8% though that is after a 25% surge in the first half of the year.  In cyberspace Bitcoin is down 22% which might sound calamitous. But it was up 220% in H1.  What is perhaps more telling for the overall picture is that FANG stocks, which have been one of the big driving forces for equity markets in recent years, have struggled to make more than 1% this quarter as a set.  Facebook (FB.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) are both down over 8%, Apple (AAPL.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) are both up over 10%, but streaming giant Netflix (NFLX.O) is down a hefty 27% having been up 38% for the year going into Q3.  “The trend driver right now is the U.S.-China situation. That holds the levels and the direction for currencies now,” said SEB’s Peterson. “The tipping point will be if we get some real progress there.”  (GRAPHIC - Emerging market stocks suffer in Q3: here)  (GRAPHIC - Global FX markets in 2019: here) 	Reuters

In the drop zone though, Hong Kong’s protests saw the Hang Seng lose 9% in its worst quarter in four years and plenty of emerging markets from South Africa to Saudi Arabia have buckled badly too.  MSCI’s all country world index, which now tracks around 2,700 stocks in 49 countries is set for its first quarterly dip of the year but a near 2% rebound this month has limited the damage to a modest 0.5%.  A weaker yuan means China’s big bourses are down as well in dollar terms despite Beijing’s stimulus efforts in the face of the trade war. But then again so too are London, Frankfurt and Paris in Europe.  The dollar is up over 3% against a basket of top global currencies but sterling’s additional Brexit worries mean it is down a bit more and the euro is more than 4% lower after the ECB’s cut its interest into even more negative territory.  It’s been the worst quarter for the Australian dollar, meanwhile, since the end of 2016 as its China-sensitive economy has spluttered while 6.5% has been lopped off its Antipodean cousin, the New Zealand dollar .  “The U.S. dollar has been very strong really against everything,” explained head of currencies at State Street Global Advisors, James Binny, citing global factors like the trade war.  “It is getting to the point where it is quite expensive. As with anything it is difficult to pick the turning point, but it’s like a stretched rubber band — the more you stretch it the stronger the forces that bring it back.”  Among commodities there has been a big split too, but there it has been between what’s precious and what’s not.  Safe-haven gold is up 4.5% and is now on its longest quarterly winning streak since 2011 having been rising since Q4 2018. Equally precious palladium meanwhile is up for a sixth straight quarter - its best run since 2000.  Industrial bellwether and China proxy copper is at the other end of the spectrum. The red metal is down for a sixth quarter in the last seven. It has been black for oil too - it is down over 8% though that is after a 25% surge in the first half of the year.  In cyberspace Bitcoin is down 22% which might sound calamitous. But it was up 220% in H1.  What is perhaps more telling for the overall picture is that FANG stocks, which have been one of the big driving forces for equity markets in recent years, have struggled to make more than 1% this quarter as a set.  Facebook and Amazon are both down over 8%, Apple and Google are both up over 10%, but streaming giant Netflix is down a hefty 27% having been up 38% for the year going into Q3.  “The trend driver right now is the U.S.-China situation. That holds the levels and the direction for currencies now,” said SEB’s Peterson. “The tipping point will be if we get some real progress there.” 	Reuters

Home prices in the former British colony have rocketed over 200% in the past decade, driven by limited housing supply and large capital flows from mainland Chinese buyers, angering many residents who can’t afford to get on the property ladder.  And despite the worst protests since Hong Kong reverted to China rule, property prices have hardly budged.  Lily Chow, a 32-year-old clerk, is among the lucky ones. She and her husband recently snapped up a two-bedroom apartment off the plans for HK$7.5 million ($957,000) in the New Territories.   “I am not confident in the government, outlook or economy. I am only confident that Hong Kong property prices will not drop,” Chow told Reuters in the sales office of the development.  Property firm Wheelock (0020.HK) has sold 80% of the 816 flats in its projects since late August, lower than sales at other launches this year, but “still good” given the current environment, property agents said.  As Hong Kong gears up for yet another anti-government protest on Oct. 1 - the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China - there was scant sign the prospect of further violence had dampened homebuyer demand.   Hundreds of prospective buyers queued on Thursday in a sales office in the gleaming International Commerce Centre (ICC) skyscraper for a development near Mong Kok district, the site of some of the most violent protests in recent months.    “The political environment is shakeable, but I am pretty sure the property market is unshakeable,” said office assistant Candy Lau, 32, as she queued for an HK$8 million, 273 sq ft,  one-room apartment in the development by Sun Hung Kai Properties (0016.HK), Hong Kong’s largest developer by market value.  A week earlier, Sun Hung Kai launched its first batch of 352 flats in the same development in Kowloon district, selling all but one to underscore the strong demand.   A traditional belief in bricks and mortar investment and a history of strong returns from property has helped Hong Kong home buyers keep the faith.  Official data showed Hong Kong property prices rose 8.5% in the first eight months of the year.   Data released on Monday showed August house prices dropped 1.37%, which was within expectations, following a tiny 0.1% decline in July after the mass protests intensified in mid-June.   One reason for the smaller-than-expected drop in July was low transaction volumes, caused by a mismatch of price expectations between sellers and buyers.  But with signs sellers are now more willing to reduce their initial asking prices, volumes have stabilized, according to realtors.  “There’s still much real demand, and when sellers became more willing to cut prices by 10-20%, some buyers chose to enter the market,” said Derek Chan, realtor Ricacorp’s head of research. He estimates a 5% rise in prices for the full year, down from an earlier forecast of 10%.   Two other buyers told Reuters they expect home prices will climb in the long run, despite any short-term softness, because a fundamental supply shortage simply won’t go away.  Every day, Hong Kong grants 150 residential permits to mainland Chinese, according to the government, adding to a population of 7.4 million crammed into just 1,100 sq km (425 square miles), of which 40 percent is country parks or nature reserves.   Tiny living spaces have become increasingly common in the world’s most expensive property market where some of the city’s poorest people live in cage homes - wire mesh hutches stacked on top of each other.     Long-standing frustrations over unaffordable housing have spilled onto the streets during recent protests, which started over a now-suspended extradition bill and have evolved into calls for greater democracy, among other demands.   “7K for a house like a cell and you really think we out here scared of jail,” reads graffiti scrawled near one protest site. HK$7,000 ($893) is what the monthly rent for a tiny room in a shared apartment could cost in Hong Kong, which reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997.  Making housing more affordable has been among every post-colonial Hong Kong leaders’ top priorities, but each administration has been unable to rein in skyrocketing prices that have fueled discontent in the city.  Sun Hung Kai Properties deputy managing director Victor Lui told an earnings conference this month that even though the company’s schedule for new launches was slightly delayed due to the protests, the company planned to keep pushing out new home sales in coming months.  He expects property prices to be flat for the full year.      Agents said the most sought-after properties are small to medium-sized apartments below 600 square feet, while the luxury segment continues to slow due to a drop-off in Chinese buyers and caution over the U.S.-China trade war.  Citi Hong Kong’s latest survey showed interest in property ownership in the third quarter - 20% of respondents - was little changed from the preceding quarter, even though more respondents expected prices to fall than rise in the next 12 months.   Taking a “wait and see” approach, around 5% of would-be buyers were now opting to rent, agents said, sending average rents in August 4.5% higher than January.       Thanks to tighter debt servicing requirements in recent years, most home owners are expected to be able to continue meeting repayments even in the case of a big correction, avoiding systematic pressure, analysts say.   While JP Morgan predicts a 30% slide in prices in a worst-case scenario, many people remain confident in the market.   “The protests are only a small incident happening in Hong Kong,” said Josephine Tsang, a 57-year-old retired teacher, who recently bought an apartment for her 28-year old son. “If I don’t buy now, the price will keep rising.”  	Reuters

Ho, who earlier this month urged members of the U.S. Congress to pass legislation to combat human rights abuses in Hong Kong, was talking to reporters at the Taipei rally when the man ran up to her and poured red paint over her head.  Two Taiwanese men were arrested immediately after the attack, the island’s Crime Investigation Bureau said, adding that the pair were linked to an organized crime group which supports closer ties between self-ruled Taiwan and China.  Organizers said around 100,000 people attended the Taipei rally to support the anti-government protests in Hong Kong, part of a global “anti-totalitarianism” rally ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China on Oct. 1.  “A lot of social activists in Hong Kong are actually subjected to situations like this every day. I think this is very obviously a sort of suppression and intimidation,” Ho told reporters after being hit by the paint.  “I think that Hong Kong people will not back down or be scared by situations like this,” she said, calling the incident “an attack on free speech”.       Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets of Chinese-ruled Hong Kong since mid-June in protests denouncing what they perceive as creeping interference by Beijing, a charge China denies. Sunday saw some of the most violent clashes since the protests began, with Hong Kong police firing water cannon, rubber bullets and rounds of tear gas at petrol bomb-throwing protesters.  Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said Ho’s attackers “will be harshly punished” according to law and that Taiwan will not tolerate violence.  “Please take our will and determination to protect Taiwan’s democracy seriously,” Tsai said in a post on Facebook. “This is the land of freedom and civilization, not the territory of rampant totalitarianism. Don’t try to challenge Taiwan’s democracy and rule of law.”  People in Taiwan have been closely watching Hong Kong and many have become increasingly wary of Beijing’s “reunification” agenda for Taiwan.  China considers democratic Taiwan a breakaway province to be taken under its control, by force if necessary, and has suggested an arrangement similar to Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” formula guaranteeing certain freedoms.   Braving heavy rain ahead of an approaching typhoon, many protesters in Taipei wore black and repeatedly chanted “free Hong Kong. Stand with Hong Kong.” Some carried signs that read “support Hong Kong, against totalitarianism.”      Beijing has accused Taipei of supporting the Hong Kong protests, an accusation Taiwan denies.  Thousands of people from Hong Kong have left for Taiwan in recent years, citing fears of Chinese erosion of the city’s freedoms.  Commenting on Sunday’s protests around the globe, Tsai said many were rallying for freedom and democracy. “Everyone’s heart is with Hong Kong.” 	Reuters

A series of protests for and against the city’s Communist Party rulers in Beijing is planned ahead of the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic on Tuesday, including at the consulate of former colonial power Britain.  The protesters, many dressed all in black and wearing masks, took cover under umbrellas from the water cannon and fled after the demonstrations had taken a familiar turn into clashes with police as they have done regularly over more than three months.  Police fired blue water, used in other countries to help identify offenders, as protesters regrouped 100 yards (meters) away.  They had smashed windows of government offices and tried to break in, shouting obscenities and daubing slogans on shop-fronts. They also shone lasers at a helicopter hovering overhead.  “A large group of violent protesters are occupying Harcourt Road. They also hurled bricks at police officers. Their acts pose a serious threat to the safety of everyone on site,” police said in a statement.  The protesters, some frantically changing out of their tell-tale black clothes behind umbrellas on the way, later headed west toward Central, the main tourism and business district.  The narrow streets between towering office buildings are full of top-brand malls, banks and jewelry shops, and many stores had closed their shutters. But there was no trouble.  There were some loud, angry scuffles between residents and police as arrests were made in the upmarket shopping district of Causeway Bay, to the east of Central, but no major clashes.   Thousands, young and old, had gathered peacefully at a harborside park to mark the fifth anniversary of the “Umbrella” pro-democracy movement which gridlocked streets for 79 days in 2014. A band was playing Beatles music as the violence erupted on the road next door.  The park sits in front of central government offices and the Legislative Council, both of which have come under attack before, sparking violent street battles with police.  “It’s a special day for Hong Kong protesters. We will stick together to fight for freedom,” said Sam, 33, dressed in black and wearing a mask. “Most people think Hong Kong was dying after five years, but many people are still fighting for Hong Kong.”  Anti-government protesters have attacked the legislature, Beijing’s main Liaison Office, occupied the airport, thrown petrol bombs at police, vandalized metro stations and set street fires.  Police have responded with tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and occasional live rounds fired into the air.   The MTR subway system closed entrances to some stations on Saturday to prevent fresh attacks.  “They are not our children,” China supporter Yau Mei-kwang said of the frontline activists. “Because at this age, they should be studying, not running to the airport, hitting people, hitting the police, insulting people. That is not right.”  A pro-democracy protester who only gave his name as Wong defended the use of violence. “We know that they will not listen if we rally in peace because we are not on the same level.”  Protesters had spent the afternoon rebuilding “Lennon Walls” of anti-government graffiti, some of which were torn down by pro-Beijing activists last weekend.   Anti-government protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula guaranteeing freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.  China dismisses the accusation and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment. It has denounced the protests but said it has faith in the Hong Kong government to resolve the crisis without the use of PLA troops based in the territory.  Protesters appealed to Britain two weeks ago to rein in China and ensure it respects the city’s freedoms. They plan to do so again on Tuesday.  Britain says it has a legal responsibility to ensure China abides by the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. At the same time, it wants closer trade and investment cooperation with China after it leaves the European Union at the end of October.  Protests were sparked in June by planned legislation, since withdrawn, that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China. But they have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement.  One of the leaders of the protests, the bespectacled Joshua Wong, 22, said on Saturday he would run for local district council elections in November.  “It’s time to let Emperor Xi (Chinese President Xi Jinping) be aware that now is our battle,” he told reporters. “We stand in solidarity, we stand as one.”  Official festivities for National Day have been scaled back, with authorities keen to avoid embarrassing Beijing just as Xi seeks to project an image of national strength and unity.

Thousands of protesters rallied at the harbourside on Friday, chanting slogans accusing the police of brutality amid more than three months of often violent unrest in the Chinese-ruled territory.  That came ahead of the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China on Tuesday, when there are pro- and anti-Beijing protests planned across the former British colony, including at the British Consulate where protesters this month asked for help in reining in Beijing.  Protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula intended to guarantee freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.  China vehemently denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of inciting the unrest.  Saturday is also the fifth anniversary of the start of the “Umbrella” protests, 79 days of student-led demonstrations in 2014 calling for universal suffrage that failed to wrest concessions from Beijing.  One of the most prominent leaders of those protests, the bespectacled Joshua Wong, 22, is expected to announce on Saturday he will run for local district council elections in November, his supporters said.  He is on bail after being charged with inciting and participating in an unauthorised assembly outside police headquarters on June 21.  Thousands of people are also expected to rally in the city centre on Saturday evening.  Protests are expected on Sunday to mark Global Anti-Totalitarianism Day, with solidarity events planned in cities across the world, including Paris, Berlin, Taipei, New York, Kiev and London.  But the biggest protests are likely to be on Oct. 1, marking the anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, with protesters saying they plan to use the holiday to propel calls for greater democracy.  Activists plan a mass rally from Victoria Park in the bustling Causeway Bay district to Chater Garden, a cricket pitch back in colonial days, home to the elite Hong Kong Cricket Club, in downtown Central.  Official festivities for National Day have been scaled back, with authorities keen to avoid embarrassing Beijing at a time when President Xi Jinping is seeking to project an image of national strength and unity.  The protests were sparked in June by a bill, since withdrawn, that would have allowed extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China. But they have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement.

The downtown rally was one of a series of protests that have united activists denouncing Chinese rule, calling for democracy and even for independence from Beijing, often resulting in violent clashes with police in the former British colony.  Activists have targeted police over more than three months with petrol bombs, rocks and laser shone in their eyes, furious at social media footage of random beatings, especially one night against protesters cowering on the floor of a subway train.  Police have responded with teargas, water cannon, rubber bullets and occasional live rounds fired into the air.  The protesters gathered at a park on reclaimed land in front of central government offices on Friday night calling for an investigation into the remote San Uk Ling camp near the Chinese border where they say detained protesters were abused, a claim police deny.  “It’s obvious that there’s a problem of police brutality,” said 19-year-old university student Peter Sin. “They now arrest people randomly and there’s much inhumane treatment during prosecution and detention.”   Police said the camp was no longer being used to hold protesters.  “Its setting and facilities are all in line with police policies and regulations,” they said in a statement. “We will stop using San Uk Ling Holding Centre for holding arrested people in this operation. The reason is to avoid any further public speculation and unnecessary remarks accusing the police.”   One officer told reporters last week that some officers had overstepped the line when dealing with protesters.  “You are talking about a prolonged situation, chaos, violent encounters,” he said. “We have established procedures to deal with allegations of abuse of force. Every day, with every chance we have, we remind our officers not to succumb to emotions.  “We’ve gone through multiple situations where lethal force would have been justified, but our officers chose not to use it.”     Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, in the first “open dialogue” session with the people on Thursday, said she would not accede to protesters’ demands for an independent inquiry into police action. She did not explain why.  This weekend, the Asian financial hub marks the fifth anniversary of the start of the “Umbrella” protests, a series of student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014 that failed to wrest concessions from Beijing.  One of the most prominent leaders of those protests, the bespectacled Joshua Wong, then just 17, is expected to announce on Saturday that he will run for local district council elections in November, his supporters said.  He is on bail after being charged with inciting and participating in an unauthorized assembly outside police headquarters on June 21.  Thousands of people are expected to rally in the city center on Saturday evening. Protests are also expected on Sunday to mark Global Anti-Totalitarianism Day, with solidarity events planned in cities across the world, including Paris, Berlin, Taipei, New York, Kiev and London.  But the biggest protests are likely to be on Oct. 1, marking the anniversary of the proclamation of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, with protesters saying they plan to use the holiday to propel calls for greater democracy.   Activists plan a mass rally from Victoria Park in the bustling Causeway Bay district to Chater Garden near government headquarters.  Official festivities for National Day have been scaled back, with authorities keen to avoid embarrassing Beijing at a time when President Xi Jinping is seeking to project an image of national strength and unity.  Pro-Beijing rallies are also planned in the city, raising the prospect of clashes.  The protests were sparked in June by a bill, since withdrawn, that would have allowed extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China but have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement.  Protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula intended to guarantee freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.  China denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of inciting the unrest. 	Reuters

Gold futures were trading around 37,445 rupees per 10 grams on Friday after falling to 37,399 rupees earlier in the day, the lowest level since Aug. 13.  “The phone was ringing continuously (today). Jewellers were placing orders from across the country,” said one Mumbai-based dealer at a bullion-importing private bank.  Dealers were offering a discount of up to $12 an ounce to official domestic prices on Friday, down from a $40 discount on Thursday and up to $47 last week. The domestic price includes a 12.5% import tax and 3% sales tax.  Retail demand, however, remained lacklustre this week because of the Shradh period, which is considered inauspicious for buying bullion, said one Kolkata bullion dealer.  “From next week retail demand will start improving,” he said. “We are entering peak festive season.”  Demand for gold usually strengthens in the final quarter as India gears up for festivals such as Diwali and Dussehra.  However, Singapore dealer GoldSilver Central’s managing director, Brian Lan, said that demand could be tempered during that period if prices remain very high, noting a six-year peak scaled early this month.  In China, the world’s biggest gold consumer, dealers charged premiums in a range of about $8 to $12 an ounce over the benchmark, compared with $10 a week ago.  Premiums in Hong Kong were largely unchanged for a third week running, in an approximate range of 50 cents to $1, traders said, citing recent civil rights protests for curbed jewellery demand.  There have been some investments in bullion as the U.S.-China trade war and Hong Kong protests increased safe-haven interest in gold, but overall demand has been muted, one Hong Kong-based trader said.  Having risen to a more than two-week high earlier in the week, global benchmark spot gold prices are now on track for a weekly decline of about 1.8%.  Premiums in Singapore were seen at 50-80 cents an ounce, compared with 55-75 cents last week. 	Reuters

438	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1WB06V	September 26, 2019 /  2:09 AM / in 6 months	Hong Kong protesters trap leader for hours in stadium after 'open dialogue'	HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong protesters chanting anti-government slogans trapped  city leader Carrie Lam in a stadium for hours on Thursday after she held her first “open dialogue” with the people in a bid to end more than three months of often violent unrest.  Activists blocked roads and stood their ground despite police warnings, before beginning to disperse. More than four hours after the talks had ended, a convoy carrying Lam and other senior officials left the building under police guard.  Inside the British colonial-era Queen Elizabeth Stadium, residents had earlier chastised Lam, accusing her of ignoring the public and exacerbating a crisis that has no end in sight.  She had begun by saying her administration bore the heaviest responsibility for resolving the crisis.  “The whole storm was caused by the extradition bill initiated by the government,” Lam said. “If we want to walk away from the difficulty and find a way out, the government has to take the biggest responsibility to do so.”  Protests over the now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial have evolved into broader calls for full democracy, in a stark challenge to China’s Communist Party leaders.  The demonstrations resumed after the dialogue session was over, with activists blocking roads around the stadium with iron railings and other debris.  The unrest followed an event that had been notable for not being the whitewash many predicted, with Lam directly facing off with an often critical and hostile audience, still aggrieved at the havoc they blame on the Beijing-backed leader and her team.  Protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula intended to guarantee freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.  Outside, large crowds of black-clad protesters chanted: “Hong Kong people, add oil,” a slogan meaning “keep your strength up”, while encircling the sports stadium and blocking exits.  Police warned that they would use force but did not intervene.  The event saw Lam holding talks with 150 members of the community.  Speakers criticizing her for curbing electoral freedoms, ignoring public opinion and refusing to allow an independent inquiry into allegations of police brutality. Several called on Lam to resign, saying she was no longer fit to lead.     Lam listened, taking notes, before responding on occasion. She appealed for people to give her government a chance, while emphasizing Hong Kong still had a bright future and a strong rule of law.  “I hope you all understand that we still care about Hong Kong society. Our heart still exists,” she said. “We will maintain our care for this society.”  She stressed again, however, that she saw no need at the moment for an independent inquiry, with an existing police complaint mechanism sufficient to meet public concerns.  She also reiterated there was no way she could bow to the demand for charges against those arrested for rioting to be dropped.  “I am not shirking responsibility, but Hong Kong really needs to calm down,” she said. “We have to stop sudden violence breaking out... Violation of the law will result in consequences we have to bear.”  She also conceded limits to what she could do.  “There are some things that me and my colleagues cannot influence in society ... but the dialogue will continue.”  China says it is committed to the “one country, two systems” arrangement and denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of inciting the unrest.  City rail services resumed on Thursday after being halted on Wednesday night at Sha Tin station, where protesters vandalized fittings for the second time this week.  Rail operator MTR has at times suspended city rail services during the protests, preventing some demonstrators from gathering and thus making it a target of attack, with protesters vandalizing stations and setting fires near some exits.  When violence has flared, police have responded with tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets.   Hong Kong is on edge ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1, with authorities eager to avoid scenes that could embarrass the central government in Beijing. Activists have planned a whole host of protests on the day.   The Asian financial hub also marks the fifth anniversary this weekend of the start of the “Umbrella” protests, a series of pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014 that failed to wrest concessions from Beijing.

Che-lam Presbyterian Church in Taipei said it had experimented with donations which had to comply with aviation safety rules and found that construction-type helmets and gas masks arrived in Hong Kong without a problem, while a shipment of laser pointers was blocked.  Hong Kong has been rocked for more than three months by sometimes violent protests, with activists throwing petrol bombs at police and shining lasers in their eyes, to which police have responded with tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets.  “I think that the Hong Kong of today might be the Taiwan of tomorrow,” said church administrative assistant Alex Ko.  China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own and has vowed to bring the island under its control, by force if necessary.  “No matter if in Taiwan or Hong Kong, we all must not forget that Beijing authorities don’t care about human rights and reasons,” Ko said. “We must not have any faith in them. We have to make ourselves stronger and make friends with the world to face this problem together.”  The Hong Kong protesters are furious at what they see as creeping Chinese interference in the former British colony, which returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula guaranteeing freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland for 50 years.  China says it is committed to the arrangement and denies meddling. It has also suggested the same formula for Taiwan, which it considers a recalcitrant, breakaway province.  “If Taiwan doesn’t care about its democracy and its freedom and sacrifices its own future to do business in China, I think it is very likely that Taiwan will find itself in a similar situation,” Ko said.

Police clashed with thousands of protesters in the former British colony on July 28 as they sought to defend the Hong Kong Liaison Office, a symbol of Chinese rule, from the crowds. Officers fired tear gas, rubber bullets and sponge grenades.  The mostly young activists in hard hats and gas masks dismantled street signs and fences which they used to form makeshift barricades to slow police advances. This is now a common tactic, met by the same response, almost every weekend.  A week earlier, on July 21, they had daubed slogans on the walls of the Liaison Office and thrown paint bombs at it.  The court on Wednesday adjourned the case until Nov. 19 after prosecutors said they needed more time to study 35 hours of video, including police, online and CCTV footage. The 44 defendants were released on bail.  Violence has hit parts of Hong Kong at different times over the last three months, but life goes on as normal most of the time.  But pictures of petrol bombs and street clashes broadcast worldwide present a huge embarrassment for Beijing before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic on Oct. 1.

The female reporter has been covering anti-government protests that have plunged the former British colony into its biggest political crisis in decades and posing a direct challenge to the central government in Beijing.   The journalist was attacked at a restaurant on Tuesday night by four men dressed in black and wearing the protesters’ trademark yellow helmets and masks, Apple Daily reported.   The reporter was taken to hospital, the newspaper said, but it gave no details on her condition.  Publisher Cheung Kim-hung said the newspaper “has no fear of violence and will continue to defend freedom of the press and the public’s right to know”.  The Hong Kong Journalists’ Association condemned the attack, which police said was under investigation.   The incident follows an assault on democratic lawmaker Roy Kwong, who was taken to hospital on Tuesday after being punched and kicked by three men in the Tin Shui Wai district close to the border with mainland China.  Fellow Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting said the assailants had suspected links to triads, organised criminal gangs, and the attacks were intended “to send a message to threaten all” pro-democracy lawmakers.  Demonstrators are frustrated at what they see as Beijing’s tightening grip over the city, which returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula intended to guarantee freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.  China has said it is committed to the arrangement and has repeatedly warned foreign countries not to interfere in an “internal affair”.          Speaking at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, U.S. President Donald Trump drew a link between resolving the U.S.-China trade dispute and Beijing’s treatment of Hong Kong.   Trump said Washington was “carefully monitoring the situation in Hong Kong”.  “How China chooses to handle the situation will say a great deal about its role in the world in the future.

The Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) slipped to a seasonally adjusted 48.9 from a final 49.3 in the previous month, marking the quickest pace of deterioration since February.  The index stayed below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the fifth straight month, pressured by a combination of trade frictions, Brexit uncertainty and political upheaval in Hong Kong.  The key activity gauges in the PMI survey painted a bleak picture of the manufacturing sector, and no doubt will bolster expectations for the Bank of Japan to add to its massive stimulus.  The BOJ is already moving in that direction. At its policy review last week, the central bank warned about overseas risks and signalled the chance of more support measures as early as its next policy meeting in October.  The PMI showed factory output and total new orders both contracted for the ninth straight month, while the backlog of work dropped to a level not seen since late 2012.  “Anecdotal evidence further highlighted the strong external headwinds Japanese manufacturers were faced with, namely U.S.-China trade tensions, the Hong Kong protests, Brexit and the diplomatic dispute between Japan and South Korea,” said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.  On the brighter side, a separate survey showed Japanese service activity expanded, in a sign resilient domestic demand might provide some support to an economy facing significant drag from frail manufacturing. Yet, pockets of weakness in the services industry highlighted the growing strains across businesses.  The Jibun Bank Flash Japan Services PMI fell slightly in September, expanding at a pace of 52.8 on a seasonally adjusted basis, compared to a final 53.3 in the previous month.  Though new orders increased at a slightly quicker pace than in August, employment declined for the first time in nearly three years, while future output expectations moderated to a more than two-year low.  The Jibun Bank Flash Japan Composite PM that includes both manufacturing and services slipped to 51.5 from 51.9 in August. 	Reuters

It was the biggest of several clashes across the Chinese-ruled city, most taking place in or near Mass Transit Railway (MTR) stations, now a familiar target of attack.  Hundreds of protesters, young and old, had gathered in the New Town Plaza in the New Territories town of Sha Tin, chanting: “Fight for freedom” and “Liberate Hong Kong.”  Protesters called for a boycott of businesses seen as pro-Beijing and made a paper chain of receipts from those stores, which were then hung across the mall.  Activists rounded on a man believed to have opposed them when they had trampled on the Chinese flag. Shouting, they pushed him into a corner beside the station and cheered as crowds punched and kicked him.  After 20 minutes, he managed to walk away, dazed and bleeding from the forehead. Protesters also smashed video cameras and ticket booths in the station.  Some started to trash fittings at the entrance of the mall. The protesters then spilled outside where they set fire to barricades made of cardboard, broken palm trees and other debris.  Police fired tear gas after coming under attack from bricks dug up from pathways.  Violence has hit parts of the former British colony at different times over the last three months, but life goes on as normal for most people most of the time.  However, pictures of petrol bombs and street clashes broadcast worldwide present a huge embarrassment for Beijing just days ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic on Oct. 1.  The Hong Kong government has already called off a big fireworks display to mark the day in case of further clashes. China, which has a People’s Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong, has said it has faith in Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to solve the crisis.  The protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula intended to guarantee freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.  China says it is committed to the arrangement and denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments including the United States and Britain of inciting the unrest.  There was also a noisy standoff between protesters and police at the Tsing Yi interchange station, which serves the Airport Express and the MTR.  There were also scuffles at the Kwai Fong MTR, near Tsing Yi. Activists lit a street fire outside Prince Edward MTR station, north of the Tsim Sha Tsui shopping district, where police said they would use tear gas to disperse them.  Police closed Kowloon station, also on the Airport Express route, where about 400 protesters had gathered, shouting abuse and vandalizing property.  Protest violence has often targeted the MTR, which is blamed for closing stations at the government’s behest to stop   demonstrators gathering.  Protesters are also demanding that the MTR hand over CCTV footage of police beating protesters on a train at Prince Edward station as they cowered on the floor, smartphone footage of which went viral online.  Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters who threw petrol bombs in two new towns on Saturday after pro-China groups pulled down some anti-government graffiti. There were violent clashes elsewhere in the city.  Police condemned the violence and said there had been many serious injuries in clashes between people of “different views”.  Police earlier prevented a protest targeting the airport.  Pro-democracy protesters have targeted the airport before, occupying the arrivals hall, blocking approach roads and setting street fires in the nearby town of Tung Chung. 	Reuters

The first canisters were fired when protesters hurled petrol bombs toward an approaching police line in the new town of Tuen Mun, in the west of the New Territories, and again after night fell in nearby Yuen Long.  Under a fierce sub-tropical sun, protesters in Tuen Mun set fire to a Chinese flag as others tore down wooden and metal fences and traffic bollards to build road blocks, at least one of which was set alight.  Some smashed fittings at the Light Rail Transit station, dug up bricks and picked up stones from the sides of the tracks. Others turned fire extinguishers on the police, who made several arrests.  “Radical protesters damaged facilities in Light Rail Town Centre Station in Tuen Mun with metal rods, hurled objects into the Light Rail tracks and set barricades in the vicinity, causing obstruction to the traffic,” police said in a statement.   “Radical protesters also threw petrol bombs, posing a serious threat to the safety of others and police officers.  Authorities suspended rail and bus services in the area in response.  Hundreds of protesters retreated from the lines of riot police when the tear gas was fired, many sprinting across a highway to regroup briefly. Others melted away into malls and side-streets.  Dozens of Beijing supporters had earlier torn down some of the large mosaics of colorful sticky notes calling for democracy and denouncing perceived Chinese meddling in the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  Similar “Lennon Walls” have blossomed across Hong Kong - at bus stops and shopping centers, under footbridges, along pedestrian walkways and at universities. They have also occasionally become hot spots of violence.  A pro-Beijing city legislator, Junius Ho, who has been a vocal critic of the protests, had urged his supporters to clean up approximately 100 Lennon Walls around the city on Saturday.  But in a message posted late on Friday on his Facebook page, Ho said that “for the sake of safety” the Lennon Walls would not be cleared up, only the streets.  Steve Chiu, who works in finance, said people like Ho would only give the pro-democracy movement fresh impetus.  “Through provocative acts like this, he helps unify the moderates and frontline in the movement,” he told Reuters.  The walls are named after the John Lennon Wall in communist-controlled Prague in the 1980s, which was covered with Beatles lyrics and messages of political grievance.  Hundreds of pro-democracy protesters also gathered at a shopping mall near the subway station in Yuen Long, a few km to the northeast of Tuen Mun, to mark two months since activists were attacked by a mob.  Amid unrelenting chanting and colorful denunciations of Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, they put their hands on their hearts as they sang “Glory to Hong Kong”, an anthem marking the territory’s promised wide-ranging autonomy when it returned to China.  There were clashes outside when protesters set up road blocks, threw fire bombs and taunted police who again responded with tear gas. Police made a series of arrests in a Circle K convenience store to where protesters had fled.  “Some even threw petrol bombs at a police vehicle, causing danger to the life of the police officers onboard,” police said in a statement.  On the night of July 21, more than 100 white-shirted men stormed Yuen Long station and attacked black-clad pro-democracy protesters returning from Hong Kong island as well as passers-by and journalists, wounding 45 people.  Ho was filmed laughing and shaking hands with some of the men in white shirts, but later told reporters he had no knowledge of or involvement in the violence, and had merely been reaching out to his constituents.  Later in the night, crowds also confronted police in Mong Kok district and another town in the New Territories, Tseung Kwan O, where protesters chanted slogans and attacked police cars.  Hong Kong’s protests picked up in June over legislation, now withdrawn, that would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. Demands have since broadened into calls for universal suffrage.  The protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China under a “one country, two systems” formula intended to guarantee freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.  China says it is committed to the arrangement and denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments including the United States and Britain of inciting the unrest.  The demonstrations have taken on their own rhythm and tend to peak at weekends, often with anti-government activists, many masked and in black, throwing petrol bombs at police, trashing metro stations, blocking airport roads and lighting street fires. Another protest targeting the airport is planned for Sunday.  Police have responded with tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and live rounds fired into the air, prompting accusations of brutality, which they deny. Amnesty International on Friday said some police treatment of detainees amounted to torture.  Police say they have adhered to regulations in respecting the “privacy, dignity and rights” of those in custody, allowing detainees transport to hospitals and communication with lawyers and families.

House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a news conference on Wednesday with House members - Republicans and her fellow Democrats - as well as Joshua Wong, Denise Ho and other Hong Kong democracy activists to back the “Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019.”  The activists have spent much of this week in Washington making their case for U.S. support, including testifying at a congressional hearing on Tuesday.  “Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate enthusiastically support this legislation,” Pelosi said. “We stand with ... all who are fighting for a peaceful, hopeful future.”  Leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said the committee was due to mark up - debate and vote on - the bill next week. It is expected to pass, which would send it for a vote by the full House.  A spokeswoman for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that committee was also working on its version of the legislation, hoping to hold its markup next week.  The bill’s text will not be final until it passes both houses of Congress, and it must be signed by President Donald Trump to become law.  The current version of the House bill calls for annual evaluations of whether Hong Kong still meets the conditions - including remaining autonomous - of the 1992 U.S. law granting it special economic status.  It also would require the Trump administration to identify and sanction anyone responsible for human rights abuses in Hong Kong, Republican Representative Chris Smith, one of the bill’s lead sponsors, told the news conference.  Trump has sent some mixed signals on the Hong Kong protests. In early August, he caused alarm among those sympathetic to the movement by describing the street demonstrations as riots.  Trump has since called on China to end the discord in a humanitarian way and said a crackdown could make his efforts to end a damaging trade war “very hard.”  Some industry groups worry that the legislation could threat then delicate trade talks. Backers rejected that concern.  “We cannot let commercial interests drive our policy,” Pelosi said. 	Reuters

Stilwell later said Washington believed Hong Kong still retained sufficient autonomy under the terms of the 1992 U.S. Hong Kong Policy Act that allows for special economic treatment under U.S. law.  “To date, and then given the retraction of the Extradition Act, the determination is still that Hong Kong is in accordance with the Hong Kong Policy Act, has sufficient autonomy to continue,” he said.    “Withdrawing the extradition law is a very positive step,” Stilwell told the committee.  Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, said on Tuesday she and her team would begin dialogue sessions with the community next week, while reiterating that the violence that has roiled the city over three months of protests must end.  The trigger for the unrest was an extradition bill, now withdrawn, that would have allowed people to be sent from Hong Kong to mainland China for trial.   In repose to another question, Stilwell said he had no information on any U.S. plan to impose sanctions on officials responsible for restricting freedoms in Hong Kong as required by a July 28 congressional resolution.  He declined to say whether the administration supported legislation being considered in Congress that would strengthen requirements for continuation of special treatment for Hong Kong.    “I need to take a longer look at the legislation,” he said.  Protests have continued in Hong Kong despite the withdrawal of the extradition bill and demonstrators’ demands have broadened to include universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into their complaints of excessive force by the police.  Tanya Chan, a pro-democracy legislator, said in Geneva on Tuesday that Lam’s overture was a “political gesture” and said she did not see meaningful reasons for dialogue with Lam.  U.S. President Donald Trump caused alarm among those sympathetic to the Hong Kong protests when in early August he described the protests as riots.   He has since called on China to end the discord in a humanitarian way and said a crackdown could make his efforts to end a damaging trade war with China “very hard.”   In his testimony, Stilwell rejected Chinese allegations of U.S. interference in Hong Kong.  “China has provided no evidence of a ‘black hand’ behind the protests in Hong Kong, because it doesn’t exist,” he said, reiterating Trump’s call for a humane resolution to the protests.   “The United States supports peaceful assembly and freedom of expression,” he said.

Some protesters threw bricks at police outside the Chinese People’s Liberation Army base in the city’s Admiralty district, and tore down and set fire to a red banner proclaiming the 70th anniversary on Oct. 1 of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, in a direct challenge to Beijing.   One water cannon caught fire after being hit by a petrol bomb. The water cannon fired blue jets of water, used elsewhere in the world to help identify protesters later.  “Radical protesters are currently occupying Harcourt Road in Admiralty, vandalizing Central Government Offices and repeatedly throwing petrol bombs inside,” police said in a statement.  Thousands of protesters, many clad in black masks, caps and shades to obscure their identity, raced through the streets of the financial hub in cat-and-mouse tactics with police, setting street fires and blocking roads in the heart of the city.  Authorities moved quickly to douse the fires and police fired volleys of tear gas to disperse protesters, including in the bustling shopping and tourist district of Causeway Bay.  Violence erupted in the district of Fortress Hill on the east of the island as men in white T-shirts, some wielding rods, clashed with anti-government activists.         A heavy police presence could be seen in and around subway stations. Rail operator MTR Corp has become a prime target of vandalism, with activists angry that it closes stations during protests and prevents demonstrators from gathering.   Shops in key protest areas once again shuttered early as more than three months of demonstrations continued to take a toll on business.   The Airport Authority said on Sunday passenger numbers fell 12.4% year-on-year in August to six million. Protesters last month jammed the airport arrivals hall, leading to canceled or delayed flights as they sought to draw world attention to their fight for democracy.   But while chaotic scenes of protesters clashing with police have been beamed live to the world - at times under gleaming skyscrapers in the heart of the financial center - life for many in the Chinese-ruled territory proceeds relatively normally.  While the turnout on Sunday was smaller than previous weekends, the unrest underscores the defiance of many activists.               Demonstrators are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city’s affairs despite a promise of autonomy.  The spark for the protests was planned legislation, now withdrawn, that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial.  The protests have since broadened into calls for universal suffrage.  Earlier on Sunday, protesters gathered peacefully outside the British Consulate, calling on Britain to rein in China and ensure it respects the city’s freedoms.

Kowloon, a peninsula on the mainland opposite Hong Kong island, joined later, after the Second Opium War.   The colony was expanded to include the New Territories, to the north of Kowloon, on a 99-year lease, in 1898.  Britain returned all of the territory to China, which never recognized the “unequal treaties”, in 1997.  “The Joint Declaration is a legally binding treaty between the UK and China that remains as valid today as it was when it was signed and ratified over 30 years ago,” a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said in June.  “As a co-signatory, the UK government will continue to defend our position.”  But it was not immediately clear what Britain could or would want to do to defend that position.   It is pinning its hopes on closer trade and investment cooperation with China, which since 1997 has risen to become the world’s second-largest economy, after it leaves the European Union at the end of next month.

Some protesters threw bricks at police outside the Chinese People’s Liberation Army base in the city’s Admiralty district, and tore down and set fire to a red banner proclaiming the 70th anniversary on Oct. 1 of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, in a direct challenge to Beijing.   One water cannon caught fire after being hit by a petrol bomb. The water cannon fired blue jets of water, used elsewhere in the world to help identify protesters later.  “Radical protesters are currently occupying Harcourt Road in Admiralty, vandalizing Central Government Offices and repeatedly throwing petrol bombs inside,” police said in a statement.  Thousands of protesters, many clad in black masks, caps and shades to obscure their identity, raced through the streets of the financial hub in cat-and-mouse tactics with police, setting street fires and blocking roads in the heart of the city.  Authorities moved quickly to douse the fires and police fired volleys of tear gas to disperse protesters, including in the bustling shopping and tourist district of Causeway Bay.  Violence erupted in the district of Fortress Hill on the east of the island as men in white T-shirts, some wielding rods, clashed with anti-government activists.         A heavy police presence could be seen in and around subway stations. Rail operator MTR Corp has become a prime target of vandalism, with activists angry that it closes stations during protests and prevents demonstrators from gathering.   Shops in key protest areas once again shuttered early as more than three months of demonstrations continued to take a toll on business.   The Airport Authority said on Sunday passenger numbers fell 12.4% year-on-year in August to six million. Protesters last month jammed the airport arrivals hall, leading to canceled or delayed flights as they sought to draw world attention to their fight for democracy.   But while chaotic scenes of protesters clashing with police have been beamed live to the world - at times under gleaming skyscrapers in the heart of the financial center - life for many in the Chinese-ruled territory proceeds relatively normally.  While the turnout on Sunday was smaller than previous weekends, the unrest underscores the defiance of many activists.               Demonstrators are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city’s affairs despite a promise of autonomy.

The Chinese-ruled territory has been rocked by weeks of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests, with demonstrators angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city’s affairs despite a promise of autonomy.  The Sino-British Joint Declaration, signed in 1984, lays out Hong Kong’s future after its return to China in 1997, a “one country, two systems” formula that ensures freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.  “We ask UK to take immediate action on China not honouring the Sino-British Joint Declaration and acknowledge one country, two systems is not functioning,” the rally organisers said.  The spark for the protests was planned legislation, now withdrawn, that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial, despite Hong Kong having its own much-respected independent judiciary.  The protests have since broadened into calls for universal suffrage.  China says it is committed to the “one country, two systems” arrangement, denies meddling and says the city is an internal Chinese issue. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest and told them to mind their own business.

The rally is expected to start at around noon (0400 GMT). Rain is forecast, but that hasn’t stopped protests before.  The Civil Human Rights Front has also called for a mass rally in Victoria Park, just to the east of the central business district, but police have denied permission because of earlier clashes after huge gatherings.

The protests, on a day when families traditionally gather to gaze at the moon and eat mooncakes while children swing colorful lanterns from the end of sticks, came after Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam promised to focus on housing and jobs to try to end the turmoil.  There were some scuffles late at night, and a few people taken away by police, but no reported widespread violence.  Lam, who said she caused “unforgivable havoc” by igniting the crisis and would quit if she had the choice, said in a Facebook post her government would increase the supply of housing in the Chinese-ruled city.  “Housing and people’s livelihoods are the main priorities,” Lam said. “The government will add to housing supply measures which will be continuously put in place and not missed.”  Hong Kong has some of the world’s most expensive real estate and many young people say the city’s housing policy is unfair, benefiting the rich while forcing the less well-off to live with their parents or rent “shoe box” apartments at exorbitant prices.  Sun Hung Kai Properties, which reported its earnings on Thursday, said the current unrest was a wake-up call to both the government and private companies to build more housing.  Financial Secretary Paul Chan told reporters a new vacancy tax aims to push developers to launch completed apartments on to the market as soon as possible.  As darkness fell on Friday night, protesters armed with flashlights, mobile phones and lanterns gathered at Victoria Peak and Lion Rock.  They lined the path running along the north face of the Peak, looking across the harbor to Lion Rock in the distance, with mainland China beyond.  Protesters gathered in their hundreds across the territory, singing and chanting, in contrast to the violence of many previous weekends when police have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon.  “Today, there’s not many here because we have an event in every district, and because this area is not a residential area, it’s a working area full of offices,” said protester Jason Liu in the Admiralty district of government offices and hotels.  The spark for the protests was a now-withdrawn extradition bill and concerns that Beijing is eroding civil liberties, but many young protesters are also angry at sky-high living costs and a lack of job prospects.  The demonstrations started in June in response to a bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts, but have broadened into calls for greater democracy.  The former British colony returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland - including a much-cherished independent legal system.  At lunchtime on Friday, hundreds of pro-Beijing supporters packed into a shopping mall waving China flags and singing the Chinese national anthem.   Sit-ins at shopping malls are also planned over the weekend.   Activists also plan to gather outside the British consulate on Sunday to demand that China honors the Sino-British Joint Declaration that was signed in 1984, laying out Hong Kong’s post-1997 future.  China says Hong Kong is now its internal affair. It denies meddling in Hong Kong and has accused the United States, Britain and others of fomenting the unrest.  Britain says it has a legal responsibility to ensure China abides by its obligations under the Joint Declaration.  Hong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade as a result of the unrest. A surge in migration applications suggests more locals are making plans to leave.  China has called on its biggest state firms to take a more active role in Hong Kong, including stepping up investment and asserting more control over companies.  Multiple Hong Kong events and conferences have been canceled and the number of visitors plunged 40 percent in August. The city’s premier women’s tennis event scheduled for October has been postponed.  Organizers also called off the Royal Shakespeare Company’s “Matilda the Musical”, due to run from Sept. 20 to Oct. 20.  Police on Tuesday set up an “anti-violence hotline” on which people could call in giving intelligence on planned unrest.  On Friday they announced it had been shut down because of “different opinions”. 	Reuters

Their sentiments, reflected in passport paperwork and in interviews with residents, migration agents and real estate brokers across the globe, show the potential for human and capital flight out of Hong Kong.   Since an abortive push to allow extradition to mainland China sparked unrest in the former British colony three months ago, emigration seminars have been overflowing, organizers and attendees say.  Requests for police-record printouts, which cost HK$225 ($29) and are only issued for visa applications or child adoptions, jumped 54% to 3,649 in August compared with last year. There have been more requests in 2019 so far than at the same point in any of the previous five years.  In 2017, the most recent year for which figures are available, there were 75 adoptions in Hong Kong, a number comparable to previous years. The Hong Kong government estimates that last year about 7,600 people left the city for good, roughly one-third the number who sought police-record printouts.  Authorities in Malaysia, Australia and Taiwan have reported spikes in migration enquiries, and property agents from Melbourne to Vancouver say their phones are running hot.   “There are many uncertainties in Hong Kong,” one investor on a property agent’s late-August tour of suburban Melbourne said before, laying out A$600,000 ($410,000) for a house-and-land package.  “People like me in their 40s and 50s - we think about our child,” said the investor, who gave only her family name, Lee, because her employer forbids speaking to the media.  “We want a back-up home, a better place to live,” she added. “At least if something bad happens, they have a back-up plan, an exit plan.”  And she is not alone: Lee’s sentiments were echoed in interviews with 10 other families or individuals considering emigrating.  China has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest, and the Hong Kong government has sought to head off further trouble by accepting one of the protesters’ demands and withdrawing the extradition bill.  A mass march scheduled for Sunday will test how far that has allayed public anger.  As Hong Kong’s protests have expanded during the summer, swelling to million-strong marches and calls for democracy, so too have Hong Kongers’ searches for safe havens.  In June, lawyers and bankers told Reuters that wealthy tycoons were shifting their fortunes to places like Singapore.  Now, migration agents say, middle-class families are checking out cheaper alternatives.  “The numbers are the highest in recent years, even higher than 2014,” said Peggy Lau, a sales director at Uni Immigration Consultancy in Hong Kong, where enquiries have surged sevenfold since protests began in June.  To be sure, there is no official data tracking emigration applications from Hong Kong, which has a population of about 7 million. Nor is there evidence of departures or cash outflows on the scale of those in the aftermath of the 1997 handover from Britain to China.   But there are firm signs of preparations.  Favored destinations such as Malaysia, which is relatively cheap, and Taiwan, which is culturally similar to Hong Kong, show sharp rises in interest.  At Johor, near Malaysia’s southern tip, property consultant Bruce Lee said Hong Kongers have poured into a project called Forest City, developed by China’s Country Garden Holdings Co Ltd (2007.HK), buying 800 units since June.  That compares with 200 units purchased between then and 2016, when sales began.  The number of visas issued to Hong Kongers in Taiwan in June and July was 38% higher, at 884, than in the same period a year ago, according to the island’s Ministry of the Interior National Immigration Agency.  Enquiries by Hong Kongers at Immigration@SG LLP, an immigration consultancy in Singapore, rose by roughly a quarter in the past two months compared with earlier in the year, said a company spokesman, Muhammad Ryhan.  State authorities in Australia have noted a “significant” increase in visa enquiries from Hong Kong, but declined to give details. Immigration agents have said there is also growing interest in Canada, the U.S. and Ireland.  In New Zealand, the number of monthly applicants for residency visas from Hong Kong passport holders hit 34 in June and 44 in July, modestly higher than the average of 29.  There are signs that property investors are laying the groundwork for a move as well.      Hong Kong’s famously frothy real estate market, worth $1.3 trillion, is shrinking, with prices edging lower for a second consecutive month in July and transaction volumes forecast to hit a six-month low.  Peter Wong, a property agent in Sydney, has taken a half-dozen calls from Hong Kong buyers in the last month, the first he can remember in decades. Some agents have also reported sudden interest in Taiwan and Vancouver.  There are no signs yet of an effect on prices in destination markets, but demand is strong enough that agents and developers say they have begun actively courting Hong Kongers.   “We see there is an opportunity,” said Ken Dodds, sales director at Melbourne homebuilder Resimax, which hosted 43 Hong Kong investors last month, after previously focusing on buyers from Malaysia and Singapore.  “People are keen to look for a safe haven,” he said, adding that the investors bought or reserved a dozen properties, which he described as a “great” result.  It is a trend some in the market expect to continue.  “This episode has planted a seed in many Hong Kongers with Canadian ties to begin the process of moving money, assets, and family out of Hong Kong and back to Canada,” Dan Scarrow, president of Vancouver-based Macdonald Realty told Reuters.  “This process will play out over the coming years, not over the coming weeks,” he said.

The Mid-Autumn Festival, which falls on Friday this year, is a harvest celebration observed throughout the Chinese-speaking world and in East and Southeast Asia. It is celebrated with mooncakes, gazing at the full moon and colorful lantern displays.  Protesters plan a series of lantern-carrying human chains and sit-ins at MTR shopping malls and on the scenic Victoria Peak, popular with mainland tour groups, and on Lion Rock, separating the New Territories from the Kowloon peninsula.  There were some lunchtime scuffles on Thursday between pro-Beijing and anti-Hong Kong government demonstrators in the mall of the IFC, a prominent skyscraper on the newly reclaimed Central waterfront. Some top-brand stores briefly closed.  Anti-government protesters gathered there again after office hours, chanting “five demands, not one less” and “add oil, Hong Kong people”, a phrase meaning keep drawing strength that has become a rallying cry of the protest movement.  One of the protest movements five demands was the withdrawal of the extradition bill, to which Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has agreed. The four others are: retraction of the word “riot” to describe the protests; release of all arrested demonstrators, now numbering 1,365; an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality; and the right for Hong Kong people to choose their own leaders.  There were also clashes, involving hundreds of people pushing and pulling, at the Yuen Long MTR station in the rural New Territories. The station was the scene of violence on the night of July 21, when it was stormed by more than 100 white-shirted men wielding pipes and clubs who wounded 45 people, including both anti-government protesters and passers-by.   Meanwhile, police denied the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) permission for a mass downtown march on Sunday.  “In previous marches applied for by CHRF, participants, reporters and police suffered serious injuries,” police said in their refusal letter to the group.  Dozens turned out for a protest outside Prince Edward MTR metro station to mark the night of Aug. 31, when police were caught on CCTV beating protesters on a train as they cowered on the floor.  The MTR has since become a prime target of vandalism. Activists are angry that the MTR closes stations to stop protesters from gathering and have demanded the transit company release CCTV footage of the beatings.  “Why don’t they give the public the CCTV footage?” asked protester Luk, 21. “...There are many injured and being arrested during this protest.

In a memo to staff on Wednesday evening, new Chief Executive Augustus Tang said he had asked executives to examine spending and focus on cutting costs. The airline will also not replace departing employees in non-flying positions unless approved by a spending control committee, he said.  Cathay has said it will cut capacity for the upcoming winter season after reporting an 11.3% fall in passenger numbers for August. The airline does not expect September to be any less difficult, while analysts have projected it could swing to a loss in the second half.  Cathay shares fell 2.4% early on Thursday, lagging the benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI that was down 0.4%.  The weak demand and cuts to capacity will heap more pressure on Cathay and its new management, appointed after CEO Rupert Hogg quit last month in a shock move and the resignation of Chairman John Slosar last week.  Cathay, which is trying to complete a three-year financial turnaround plan, has become the biggest corporate casualty of the Hong Kong protests after China demanded it suspend staff involved in, or supporting, the demonstrations that have plunged the former British colony into a political crisis.  Jefferies analyst Andrew Lee told clients he expected the airline could swing to a HK$973 million ($124.1 million) loss in the second half of the year. BOCOM International analyst Luya You said second-half earnings could be “notably dismal”.

Hong Kong has been rocked by months of sometimes violent unrest, prompted by anger over planned legislation to allow extraditions to China, but broadening into calls for democracy and for Communist rulers in Beijing to leave the city alone.  “Anti-government fanatics are planning massive terror attacks, including blowing up gas pipes, in Hong Kong on September 11,” the Hong Kong edition of the China Daily said on its Facebook page, alongside a picture of the hijacked airliner attacks on the twin towers in New York.  “The 9/11 terror plot also encourages indiscriminate attacks on non-native speakers of Cantonese and starting mountain fires.”  The post said “leaked information was part of the strategy being schemed by radical protesters in their online chat rooms”.  The former British colony of Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent legal system, triggering the anger over the extradition bill.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has said she will withdraw the bill but many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is steadily eroding the autonomy of the Asian financial hub.  China denies meddling and has accused the United States, Britain and others of fomenting the unrest.  “We don’t even need to do a fact check to know that this is fake news,” said one protester, Michael, 24, referring to the China Daily post. “The state media doesn’t care about its credibility. Whenever something they claimed to have heard on WhatsApp or friends’ friends, they will spread it right away.”  The protesters called off action on Wednesday.  “In solidarity against terrorism, all forms of protest in Hong Kong will be suspended on Sept. 11, apart from potential singing and chanting,” they said in a statement.  The China Daily report was worrying, said another protester, Karen, 23. “When they try to frame the whole protest with those words, it alarms me,” she said. “They are predicting rather than reporting. I think people calling it off today is a nice move.”  The chairwoman of the Hong Kong Federation of Women, Pansy Ho, a prominent businesswoman and daughter of Macau casino operator Stanley Ho, said she was worried about violent extremism.  “Children of all ages are indoctrinated with police hatred and anti-establishment beliefs at school and online mobilized to conduct massive school strikes,” she told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva.    Lam said in a speech on Wednesday that Hong Kong was grappling with significant challenges.  “My fervent hope is that we can bridge our divide by upholding the one country, two systems principle, and the Basic Law, and through the concerted efforts of the government and the people of Hong Kong,” she told business leaders.  The Basic Law is Hong Kong’s mini-constitution.  Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd has become the biggest corporate casualty of the unrest after China demanded it suspend staff involved in, or who support, the protests.  Cathay Pacific said on Wednesday inbound traffic to Hong Kong in August fell 38% and outbound traffic 12% compared with a year earlier, and that it did not anticipate September to be any less difficult.   Joshua Wong, one of the prominent leaders of the 2014 “Umbrella” pro-democracy movement which brought key streets in Hong Kong to a standstill for 79 days, said in Berlin that the fight for democracy was an uphill battle.  “I hope one day not only Hong Kong people, but also people in mainland China, can enjoy freedom and democracy,” he said.

China said Lee Meng-chu, an adviser from a small township in Taiwan, who had been missing since Aug. 19 after traveling to the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, was suspected of “engaging in criminal acts that endanger state security”.   Lee had distributed photographs of Hong Kong’s protests and Chinese troops gathering on China’s border with the city before his disappearance, Taiwan’s official Central News Agency has reported.  “The Democratic Progressive Party urges citizens to avoid visiting Hong Kong and China due to tough internal situations,” Taiwan’s ruling party said in a statement.  It expressed “strong condemnation” of Lee’s detention.  “If you have to visit these areas, you must pay serious attention to safety and report whereabouts to your families and friends at all times,” the party said.  The detention comes amid a delicate time for cross-strait relation with the protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong posing the biggest challenge for Communist Party rulers in Beijing since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012.  China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own and has vowed to bring the island under its control, by force if necessary.  China has suggested the island could be ruled under a formula similar to Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” arrangement, which guarantees certain freedoms, but Hong Kong’s protests have raised questions about the formula.  Beijing has accused Taipei of supporting the Hong Kong protests. Taiwan denies that.      In Beijing, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said Lee was being investigated “in accordance with the law”. He gave no other details.    Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council demanded Beijing give a “full explanation”, including information on Lee’s whereabouts and the charge he faces.  “The mainland authority has not informed us or his family, nor given explanation,” the council said.  Despite the tension between Taiwan and Beijing, many Taiwan people visit and do business in China, one of the island’s main trading partners.  Li Ming-che, a community college lecturer and an activist at a human rights organisation in Taiwan, was found guilty of subversion after visiting China in 2017. 	Reuters

The company, known for its $10,000-plus Birkin handbags, had to close stores in Hong Kong, even at the airport, for a number of days over the past two months, dragging on sales there, Financial Director Eric du Halgouet told reporters.   But Hermes’ overall performance within Greater China was still in line with strong sales trends in the first two quarters of the year, du Halgouet added, as Hermes reported a rise in net profit and operating income for the first six months of 2019.  “The impact on the Greater China region from Hong Kong ... was offset by the strong activity in mainland China,” du Halgouet said.  Hermes said its operating income rose 15% in the first half to 1.14 billion euros ($1.26 billion), while operating margins were just shy of last year’s record levels, at 34.8%. 	Reuters

The latest sign of unrest in the former British colony followed another weekend of sometimes violent clashes, in which police firing tear gas engaged in cat-and-mouse skirmishes with protesters who at times smashed windows and started fires in the streets.  Earlier on Tuesday, the city’s Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, warned against foreign interference in Hong Kong’s affairs, adding that an escalation of violence could not solve social issues in the Asian financial hub.  Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland. But many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is steadily eroding that autonomy.  Weeks of protests over a now withdrawn extradition bill have evolved into a broader backlash against the government and greater calls for democracy.  At Hong Kong’s main stadium on Tuesday night, a sizeable contingent of the crowd of more than 10,000 football fans jeered and held up “boo” signs as China’s anthem played before the game, while others chanted “Revolution of our time” and “Liberate Hong Kong”. Disrespecting the national anthem is an offence in China.  Other fans sang “Glory to Hong Kong,” a song that has become a rallying cry for more democratic freedoms in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.    “We hope we can unite Hong Kong,” said one of those booing, Ah Wing, wearing a red Hong Kong team shirt and glasses. “Even if we lose, we’ll keep going. That’s what we do against strong teams, against strong enemies.”  Some local fans continued to chant protest slogans during the match, which saw Iran beat Hong Kong 2-0.  During a rally at the U.S. consulate on Sunday, thousands of demonstrators, some waving the American flag, called for help in bringing democracy to Hong Kong.  The protesters urged the U.S. Congress to pass proposed legislation that would require Washington to make an annual assessment of whether Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous from mainland China to retain special U.S. trade and economic benefits.  A bipartisan group of senior U.S. senators stepped up the  pressure on Tuesday by writing to the U.S. State and Commerce Departments asking them to assess U.S. export rules for Hong Kong and expressing concern about China’s potential acquisition of sensitive U.S. technologies via the special treatment Hong Kong is allowed.  The lawmakers also expressed concern about whether current export control laws allowed U.S. persons to “inappropriately” export police equipment to Hong Kong that could be used to suppress dissent.  Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, responded to those calls at a news conference on Tuesday.  “It’s extremely inappropriate for foreign parliaments to interfere in HKSAR internal affairs in any way, and (we) will not allow (the United States) to become a stakeholder in HKSAR matters,” she said, referring to Hong Kong by its status as a special administrative region of China.  China denies meddling in the city and Chinese officials have accused foreign forces of trying to hurt Beijing by creating chaos in Hong Kong. They have also warned outsiders to keep out of what they call an internal matter.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, asked about the protests in front of the U.S. Consulate and Lam’s comments, said Beijing was resolutely opposed to any foreign government interfering in China’s affairs.  “We hope they can withdraw their black hands in Hong Kong as soon as possible,” she said.  The sometimes violent demonstrations have taken a toll on Hong Kong’s economy, which is on the verge of its first recession in a decade. Hong Kong visitor arrivals plunged nearly 40% in August from a year earlier.   Stephen Schwarz, head of sovereign ratings for the Asia-Pacific region at Fitch Ratings, said the agency’s downgrade of Hong Kong last week reflected damage to the city’s reputation as a place to do business.  “The downgrade reflects months of ongoing conflict environment which are testing the ‘one country, two systems’ framework and which have inflicted damage to the international perception of the quality and effectiveness of Hong Kong’s governance and rule of law as well as the stability of its business environment,” Schwarz said.   China expressed anger on Tuesday after German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas met prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong, reiterating that no foreign country had a right to interfere in its internal affairs.  On Monday, former U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the anti-government protests were not an internal Chinese matter and the United States should offer at least moral support to the demonstrators.  Lam last week withdrew the controversial extradition bill that had triggered the unrest, but the gesture failed to appease many demonstrators.  Anger over the now-shelved bill has rekindled opposition to Beijing that had waned after 2014, when authorities faced down 79 days of pro-democracy protests in the city’s central business district.  Lam called for dialogue on Tuesday.  “Escalation and continuation of violence cannot solve the issues faced by our society now,” she said. “It will only deepen the conflict, contradiction, splits, and even hatred in society.”    The protests, beamed live to the world since June, have also prompted some of the city’s powerful tycoons to appeal for calm.   In his first speech mentioning the unrest, billionaire Li Ka-shing urged political leaders to offer young people an olive branch, calling them “masters of our future”, according to an online video of remarks to a small crowd during a monastery visit on Sunday.  Lam said her administration’s actions, including the bill’s formal withdrawal, were “not directly to stop these protests and violence”.  “It is really to express my sincerity to start a dialogue with the people,” she said.

General Jim Mattis and “Bing” West joined Reuters Editor-At-Large Sir Harold Evans for a live discussion about their storied military careers spanning some of the most critical moments in modern U.S. history and covered the lessons learned about the nature of war fighting and peacemaking, the importance of friends and allies and more.  Among the highlights of the discussion:   -On Hong Kong protests, General Mattis said the United States should offer moral support to the demonstrators as the anti-government protests were “not an internal” Chinese matter in Hong Kong. He believed the United States should generally support those standing up for human rights.   -On Taliban talks, Mattis said he was surprised by the news last weekend that Trump had initially invited Afghanistan’s Taliban leaders for peace talks in the United States, which was canceled after the insurgent group claimed responsibility for an attack in Kabul that killed an American soldier and 11 other people.   -“Bing” West spoke about a critical lesson learned with decision making when trying to capture Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. West described how 3,000 Marines were ready to infiltrate and seal off Tora Bora, however there were various chains of commands that Mattis needed to go through before deciding to take any action. West said, “If you have all this hierarchy, but they are not the person on the ground, you have to do with some way of breaking that up.”   -Asked whether General Mattis had confidence in Trump’s leadership, he said that he had “great confidence” in American voters and in the U.S. Constitution.

474	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1VU0X4	September 9, 2019 /  9:40 AM / in 7 months	My town is the new Cold War's Berlin: Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong	BERLIN (Reuters) - Comparing the struggle of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protesters to the role of Berlin during the Cold War, activist Joshua Wong told an audience in the German capital that his city was now a bulwark between the free world and the “dictatorship of China”.  The 22-year-old activist, who was in Berlin for a newspaper-sponsored event at the German parliament celebrating human rights activists around the world, pledged that protests would not be lulled into complacency by the decision of the city’s government to drop a contested new extradition law.  “If we are in a new Cold War, Hong Kong is the new Berlin,” he said in a reception space a stone’s throw from the Berlin Wall on the roof of the Reichstag building, which for decades occupied the no-man’s land between Communist East Berlin and the city’s capitalist western half.  Hong Kong has been convulsed by months of unrest since its government announced attempts to make it easier to extradite suspects to China, a move seen as a prelude to bringing the pluralistic autonomous region more in line with the mainland.  Wong, leader of the Demosisto pro-democracy movement, has become a prominent face of the protests.  “We urge the free world to stand together with us in resisting the Chinese autocratic regime,” he added, describing Chinese leader Xi Jinping as “not a president but an emperor.”  The city’s leader, Carrie Lam, announced concessions this week to try to end the protests, including formally scrapping the bill, but Wong said protesters would not be lulled into complacency.  He said they would try to hold the city’s government responsible for what he said were human rights violations committed against protesters, adding that Lim’s climb-down was a ruse to buy calm ahead of China’s Oct. 1 national day.  He had briefly been detained by Hong Kong authorities before his departure earlier in the day for breaching bail conditions following his arrest in August when he was charged along with other prominent activists with inciting and participating in an unauthorized assembly.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel has just returned from a trip to China, during which she faced criticism from Germany for not engaging more directly with the Hong Kong protesters, whose cause is popular in Germany, though she did call for a peaceful solution to the Hong Kong unrest.

Final bids were due for the Hong Kong-headquartered company in late September but its owners - private equity firms HPEF and CVC Capital Partners - have decided to pause the process until conditions stabilize in the city, said the source, who declined to be identified because the information was not public.  CVC and HPEF declined to comment.   Three months of increasingly violent protests in Hong Kong began as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill, but have developed into a broader backlash against the government and have left the city facing its first recession in a decade.  On Sunday, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse demonstrators in the Central business district - home of many TEC offices - as well as the upmarket Causeway Bay shopping district.     TEC, founded in 1994, operates more than 130 offices in 32 cities across 14 countries in Asia and the Middle East, it said on its website.   Hong Kong accounts for about 30% of its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), according to the source.  The company is 70% owned by HPEF - formerly HSBC’s Asian private equity arm until a buyout in 2010 - 20% by CVC and 10% by management.   No price has been made public, but the Financial Times reported in April the company was seeking a valuation of more than $750 million.    TEC is on course to produce EBITDA of $46 million for 2019, according to the source.      Pausing its sale also comes as loss-making WeWork, a U.S.-headquartered office provider, has more than halved the valuation it expects from a New York initial public offering to a little over $20 billion, from the $47 billion it achieved in a private fundraising this year.  Unlike WeWork, which has focused on offering short-term space to start-ups and tech companies, TEC has focused on longer-term leases to a client roster of multinationals. 	Reuters

The retired U.S. Marine general, speaking at a Reuters Newsmaker event in New York, said the United States should generally side with those standing up for human rights, which he said included the Hong Kong protesters.  “When people stand up for those (rights), I just inherently think we ought to stand with them, even if it’s just moral,” said Mattis, who abruptly resigned as Pentagon chief in December over disagreements with President Donald Trump’s foreign policy.  “This is not an internal matter,” Mattis said in remarks likely to irritate Beijing, which has denounced the sometimes violent protests and accused the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest in the former British colony.   Trump has previously described the protests as riots, but has also called on China to end the discord in a “humanitarian” way. He said a crackdown could make his efforts to end a damaging trade war with China “very hard.”  Mattis said China’s effort to pass a law to allow people in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China was in breach of the “one country, two systems” formula under which British control of Hong Kong was ended in 1997.  “They said it would be two systems, and the extradition law was a violation of that,” said Mattis, who is promoting a new memoir about his role in the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.   Although the extradition bill was withdrawn last week after months of unrest, the mass protests in streets and public places across Hong Kong continue, having grown into a broader pro-democracy backlash against the Chinese government.   Protesters marched outside the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong over the weekend, urging Trump to help “liberate” the city. Hong Kong police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds.  “We have to be careful: We don’t want to say we’re going to land the 82nd Airborne Division in Hong Kong to do this,” he said. “But morally? Yeah, I think we have to stand with them.”  In his nearly two years as defense secretary, Mattis had tried to forge a relationship with the Chinese military, worried that tense relations between the two countries could boil over into conflict.  Mattis resigned from Trump’s administration a day after Trump’s plans to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria became public. His resignation letter was widely seen as a sharp critique of Trump’s approach to national security, including what Mattis saw as a failure to value American allies around the world.    Although there had been speculation that Mattis might enter the political arena, he has since declined to share his views on Trump, saying it is inappropriate for military figures to pontificate on politics.  Mattis also said he was surprised by the news last weekend that Trump had invited Afghanistan’s Taliban leaders for peace talks in the United States. Trump said he canceled the talks after the insurgent group claimed responsibility for an attack in Kabul that killed an American soldier and 11 other people.   “I salute people who try to bring wars to an end,” Mattis said. The Taliban, however, had repeatedly failed to break with al Qaeda, the militant group behind the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, he said.  “The Taliban was offered: If you break with al Qaeda, we have no problem with you,” Mattis said. “President (George W.) Bush offered that, President Obama offered that, President Trump has offered that, and they’ve declined. So yes, I was very surprised that we were at that point.”  Asked on Monday whether he had confidence in Trump’s leadership, he said only that he had “great confidence” in American voters and in the U.S. Constitution.  “If we will employ our constitutional checks and balances correctly, this big experiment will continue,” Mattis said.

The benchmark Nikkei average ended 0.56% firmer at 21,318.42, while the broader Topix rose 0.91% to 1,551.11 - their highest closing levels since Aug. 2.  “Three big worries for financial markets - namely, the U.S.-China trade war, Brexit jitters and Hong Kong protests - have retreated and contributed to the risk-on sentiment,” said Masayuki Kubota, chief strategist, Rakuten Securities.  Global equity markets received a lift after China’s central bank said on Friday it was cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, releasing liquidity to shore up a slowing economy dragged down by the Sino-U.S. trade war.  Risk sentiment also improved as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Friday that the central bank will continue to act “as appropriate” to sustain the economic expansion in the world’s biggest economy.  However, broader stock market gains were tempered in the wake of lacklustre economic data - U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in August, while earlier on Monday data showed Japan’s economy grew at a slower pace than initially estimated in the second quarter.  All of Tokyo’s 33 sub-sectors ended in positive territory, with oil and coal products and construction stocks among the top performing sectors, up 1.6% and 1.5%, respectively.  Elsewhere, regional bank shares rallied broadly, buoyed by growing speculation of further consolidation in the industry after SBI Holdings and Shimane Bank announced a capital tie-up plan on Friday.  Tsukuba Bank ended 9.8% firmer, Tochigi Bank soared 9.2% and Bank of Kochi Ltd advanced 4.6%, while Shimane Bank, which jumped by daily limit of 16.4% in the previous session, added 1.6%. SBI Holdings closed 1.2% higher.  Bucking the broad market trend, Nissan Motor dipped 0.2% after the Nikkei newspaper reported Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa as saying he wanted to “pass the baton” to the next generation as soon as possible.

Police moved on protesters from the Central business district who dispersed to nearby Admiralty, the bar district of Wan Chai and on to Causeway Bay in a now familiar pattern of cat-and-mouse clashes over three months of unrest.  Activists set barricades, smashed windows, started street fires and vandalized the MTR metro station in Central, the smartest district of the former British colony.  Central district, home to banks, jewelry shops and top-brand shopping arcades, was awash in graffiti, broken glass and bricks torn up from pathways. Protesters set fires from cardboard boxes, building barricades with metal fencing.  “We can’t leave because there are riot police,” said protesters Oscar, 20, in Causeway Bay. “They fired tear gas from the station. We are heading to North Point.”  North Point is east of Causeway Bay.  Thousands of protesters earlier sang the Star Spangled Banner and called on U.S. President Donald Trump to “liberate” the city. They waved the Stars and Stripes and placards demanding democracy.  “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,” they shouted before handing over petitions at the U.S. Consulate. “Resist Beijing, liberate Hong Kong.”  U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Saturday urged China to exercise restraint in Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  Esper made his call in Paris as police in Hong Kong prevented protesters from blocking access to the airport but fired tear gas for a second night running in the densely populated district of Mong Kok.  Pockets of protest broke out in Kowloon over the harbor from the main island of Hong Kong on Sunday night, including in Prince Edward, close to Mong Kok.  Last month Trump suggested China should “humanely” settle the problem in Hong Kong before a trade deal is reached with Washington. Earlier Trump called the protests “riots” that were a matter for China to deal with.  The vandalism started in the evening. Police have responded to violence over 14 weeks with water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas.  Several arrests were made.  Hong Kong returned to China under a “one country, two systems” formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland. Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding that autonomy.  China denies the accusation of meddling and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest, and warned of the damage to the economy.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced concessions this week aimed at ending the protests, including formally scrapping a hugely unpopular extradition bill, which ignited the unrest in June. Many protesters said it was too little, too late.   The bill would have allowed the extradition of people to mainland China to stand trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party. Hong Kong has an independent judiciary dating back to British rule.  But the demonstrations have long since broadened into calls for democracy.  U.S. legislation addressing China’s actions in Hong Kong will be among the top priorities pushed by Senate Democrats when Congress returns to work after a recess next week, their leader, Senator Chuck Schumer, said on Thursday.  Schumer urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican who sets the floor agenda, to bring up a bipartisan bill that would require an annual justification of the special treatment afforded by Washington to Hong Kong, including special trade and business privileges, under the U.S. Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992.  The legislation, called the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, would also mandate that officials in China and Hong Kong who have undermined the city’s autonomy are vulnerable to sanctions.  Protesters, in a petition handed to the U.S. Consulate, urged that it be passed in full.  Joshua Wong, one of the leaders of the pro-democracy “Umbrella” movement five years ago, was re-arrested at the airport on Sunday on return from Germany and the United States for breaching bail conditions, he said.  He had been charged with inciting and participating in an unauthorized assembly outside police headquarters on June 21 and released on bail.  “Preliminary legal advice suggested that the court had acknowledged and approved my trips to Germany and the U.S. when it granted bail on Aug. 30,” he said in a statement. “Therefore, it is believed that there are some mistakes have been made on the bail certificate.”  He said he thought he would be freed on Monday.

Hundreds of demonstrators, many masked and dressed in black, attacked metro stations on Kowloon peninsula on Friday night, targeted because of televised scenes of police beating protesters on a metro train on Aug. 31 as they cowered on the floor.  Activists tore down signs, broke turnstiles, set fires on the street and daubed graffiti on the walls on Friday.  “The behaviour was outrageous,” the government said in a statement.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced concessions this week to try to end the protests, including formally scrapping a hugely unpopular extradition bill, but many said they were too little, too late.  The bill would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, despite Hong Kong having an independent judiciary dating back to British colonial rule.  But the demonstrations, which began in June, have long since broadened into calls for more democracy and many protesters have pledged to fight on.  Demonstrations have at times paralysed parts of the city, a major Asian financial hub, amid running street battles between protesters and police who have responded with tear gas, pepper spray and water cannon. Violent arrests of protesters have drawn international attention.  Saturday’s planned demonstrations include yet another “stress test” of the airport aiming to disrupt transport links to Chek Lap Kok, built in the dying days of British rule on reclaimed land around a tiny island of the same name and reached by a series of gleaming bridges.  The airport announced that only passengers with tickets would be allowed to use the Airport Express train service on Saturday, boarding in downtown Hong Kong. The train would not stop en route, on the Kowloon peninsula. Bus services could also be hit, it said.  The measures are aimed at avoiding the chaos of last weekend, when protesters blocked airport approach roads, threw debris on the train track and trashed the MTR subway station in the nearby new town of Tung Chung in running clashes with police.  Protesters also occupied the arrival hall last month, halting and delaying flights, amid a series of clashes with police.

486	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1VR28O	September 6, 2019 /  5:32 PM / 7 months ago	Pence to deliver postponed China speech this fall: White House official	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A major speech on China by Vice President Mike Pence that was  expected to take a tough line on Beijing has been rescheduled for later this year, a White House official said.   The tone of the speech, originally scheduled for delivery in June, will be dictated by the needs of the moment, the person said late on Thursday, adding that it would be given at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington, as initially planned.  The news comes after Beijing announced that top officials would head to Washington in early October to hold talks aimed at ending a tit-for-tat trade war, now in its second year, which has roiled markets and hammered global growth.  The United States began targeting Chinese imports with tariffs in July last year, demanding that Beijing put an end to alleged unfair trade practices, from stealing American intellectual property to subsidizing local industry. China has responded with tariffs of its own on U.S. imports.       Pence’s China speech was postponed ahead of a meeting in Osaka, Japan, between U.S. President Donald Trump and China’s Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20.   A hardline speech on China was seen as potentially hampering Trump’s bid to use that meeting to get negotiations back on track after talks broke down in May, according to reports.   Darin Miller, a deputy press secretary for Pence’s office, confirmed the vice president would give a speech on China this fall but gave no date and offered no other details.  The postponed June speech was initially cast by aides as a sequel to a blistering broadside he delivered in October 2018.  At that time, Pence shocked China watchers with a speech in which he laid out a litany of complaints, chastising China for building “an unparalleled surveillance state” and for government-run camps in the Xinjiang region where Muslim Uighurs “endure around-the-clock brainwashing” just ahead of a major Asia-Pacific conference that he attended on behalf of Trump.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday the United States would use the United Nations General Assembly this month to persuade countries to help “call out” China over treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority.  More recently, Pence has urged Beijing to treat Hong Kong protesters humanely, warning that it would be harder for Washington to make a trade deal with Beijing if there was violence in the former British territory.  In contrast, Trump alternates between praising Xi as a great leader and casting him as an enemy, while excoriating China for taking advantage of U.S. businesses, in public remarks and tweets.  Pence returned early Friday from a week-long trip to Europe, where he urged European leaders to keep China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], the world’s top telecoms equipment maker, out of their 5G networks and urged Icelandic leaders to be vigilant against Chinese incursions in the Arctic.

The statement by Senator Chuck Schumer followed similar expressions of concern by leading Senate Republicans about the situation in Hong Kong, which has been engulfed in angry and sometimes violent protests against the government for months over a controversial bill on extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China.   The mounting Senate concern contrasts with a more “hands-off” approach to Hong Kong by Republican President Donald Trump. Last month Trump suggested China should “humanely” settle the problem in Hong Kong before a trade deal is reached with Washington. Earlier Trump called the protests “riots” that were a matter for China to deal with.  The extradition proposal has been withdrawn by Hong Kong’s leader, but dropping it was just one of five key demands by Hong Kong protesters, who are furious about the number of arrests and perceived police brutality, and want an independent inquiry.  “It’s critical that we respond to the Chinese Communist Party’s actions against the people of Hong Kong as they exercise their right to freedom of expression and other fundamental democratic rights,” Schumer said in a statement listing five top priorities for Senate Democrats, who are in the minority, this fall.  “We must take action to demonstrate to President Xi that the United States Senate stands shoulder to shoulder with the people of Hong Kong.”       Schumer urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican who sets the floor agenda, to bring up a bipartisan bill that would require an annual justification of the special treatment afforded by Washington to Hong Kong, including special trade and business privileges, under the U.S. Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992.   The bipartisan proposal, called the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, was co-sponsored by Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, among others. It would also mandate that officials in China and Hong Kong who have undermined the city’s autonomy are vulnerable to sanctions, Rubio said in an opinion piece published in the Washington Post two days ago.  McConnell earlier this week said he would urge Trump to take “forceful action” if the Chinese government uses violence to put down the protests in Hong Kong. In an interview with the Hugh Hewitt radio show, McConnell also said he would support legislation to enhance the Hong Kong Policy Act, which he authored in 1992, but did not give details.  Since the city returned to Chinese rule in 1997, critics say Beijing has reneged on a commitment to maintain Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms under a “one country, two systems” formula.  Asked about Schumer’s remarks, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a news briefing in Beijing on Friday that any “futile plots” to undermine the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong would fail.  “We again advise relevant U.S. politicians to immediately cease any legislation related to Hong Kong, immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs through any means, and do more to promote mutual trust and cooperation between China and the United States,” Geng said.

It had touched $1,557 on Wednesday, a fresh peak since April 2013.  * U.S. gold futures were down 0.2% at $1,557.8 an ounce.  * The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, dipped to a one-week low, while Asian stocks perked up on progress in the political crises in Britain and Hong Kong.  * Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, in a pre-recorded televised message, on Wednesday formally withdrew the bill, acceding to one of the five demands by pro-democracy protesters, although many demonstrators and lawmakers said the move was too little, too late.  * The British parliament voted on Wednesday to prevent Prime Minister Boris Johnson taking Britain out of the European Union without a deal on Oct. 31, but rejected his first bid to call a snap election two weeks before the scheduled exit.  * The U.S. economy grew at a modest pace in recent weeks, with manufacturing buffeted by a global slowdown while consumer purchases gave mixed signals on the strength of household spending, the Federal Reserve reported on Wednesday.  * Christine Lagarde took a major step towards becoming the European Central Bank’s next president on Wednesday, securing the backing of a European Parliament committee after pledging to keep policy loose while undertaking a broader strategy review.  * The London Metal Exchange’s gold and silver futures are being thrown into doubt, with the imminent resignation of Societe Generale as a market maker threatening to deepen a decline in trading activity, three sources said.  * Holdings in SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose 0.66% to 895.90 tonnes on Wednesday.  * India’s gold imports plunged 73% in August from a year ago to the lowest level in three years as a rally in local prices to a record high and a hike in import duty discouraged retail buying, a government source said on Wednesday.

Merkel is taking a large business delegation with her and wants to use the trip, which starts on Thursday, to push Beijing to open up its markets and embrace fairer competition - a task made harder by the year as China’s growing economic power gives it more leverage.  Normally, the birth on Saturday of twin pandas in Berlin Zoo to parents loaned by China would have helped the diplomatic climate. But developments in Hong Kong mean the visit is shaping up as Merkel’s toughest yet to China.  Ahead of her departure, prominent Hong Kong activists wrote to the chancellor urging her to be guided by her memories of life in dictatorial East Germany, and to be on her guard in her talks and business dealings with Beijing.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Wednesday withdrew an extradition bill that triggered months of often violent protests so the Chinese-ruled city can move forward, but some said the move was not enough.  The twin pressures mean Merkel will have to work hard to strike the right tone during the trip, government sources said.  The situation is complicated still further by the trade conflict between China and the United States, which is hurting internationally exposed German firms caught in the crossfire.   Germany’s economy contracted on weaker exports in the second quarter, and leading economists say it is facing a recession.   But while U.S. President Donald Trump has pressed U.S. companies to look at ways to close their Chinese operations and make more of their products at home, Merkel wants to start a new phase in the European Union’s relations with China.   Germany, which traded almost 100 billion euros ($111 billion) in goods with China in the first half of 2019, holds the rotating EU presidency in 2020, when Merkel is planning an EU-China summit with a view to achieving a common European stance.  Michael Winzer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung in Beijing, saw some Chinese readiness to compromise with the EU.  “We see a ‘strategy of embrace’ from China, which is seeking more contact with Germany and Europe because of the current U.S. policy,” he said.

Amendments to the Fugitives Offenders Ordinance contained in the bill would have allowed individuals, including foreigners, to be sent to mainland China to face trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party. The changes were seen by many as a threat to the rule of law in the former British colony.  Following is a timeline of the key dates around the extradition bill and the protests it triggered.  February 2019 – Hong Kong’s Security Bureau submits a paper to the city’s legislature proposing amendments to extradition laws that would provide for case-by-case extraditions to countries, including mainland China, beyond the 20 states with which Hong Kong already has treaties.  March 31 - Thousands take to the streets of Hong Kong to protest against the proposed extradition bill.   April 3 – Lam’s government introduces amendments to Hong Kong’s extradition laws that would allow criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial.   April 28 – Tens of thousands of people march on Hong Kong’s city assembly building, the Legislative Council, to demand the scrapping of the proposed amendments to the extradition laws.  May 11 – Scuffles break out in Hong Kong’s legislature between pro-democracy lawmakers and those loyal to Beijing over the extradition bill.  May 21 – Lam says her administration is determined to push the bill through the legislature.  May 30 – Hong Kong introduces concessions to the extradition bill, including limiting the scope of extraditable offences. Critics say they are not enough.   June 6 – More than 3,000 Hong Kong lawyers take to the streets dressed in black in a rare protest march against the extradition law.   June 9 - More than half a million take to the streets in protest.   June 12 – Police fire rubber bullets and tear gas during the city’s largest and most violent protests in decades. Government offices are shut for the rest of the week.  June 15 – Lam indefinitely delays the proposed extradition law.  July 1 - Protesters storm the Legislative Council on the 22nd anniversary of the handover from British to Chinese rule, destroying pictures and daubing walls with graffiti.  July 9 - Lam says the extradition bill is dead and that government work on the legislation had been a “total failure”.  July 21 - Men, clad in white T-shirts and some armed with poles, flood into rural Yuen Long station and storm a train, attacking passengers and passers-by, including members of the media, after several thousand activists surrounded China’s representative office in the city earlier in the day, and clashed with police.   July 30 - Forty-four activists are charged with rioting, the first time this charge has been used during these protests.   Aug. 9 - China’s aviation regulator demands Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific suspend personnel who have taken part in the protests. The airline suspends a pilot, one of 44 charged with rioting the month before, the next day.  Aug. 14 - Police and protesters clash at Hong Kong’s international airport after flights were disrupted for a second day. The airport resumed operations later that day, rescheduling hundreds of flights.   Aug. 21 - China’s biggest e-commerce company Alibaba delays its up to $15 billion listing in Hong Kong, initially set for late August.   Sept. 2 - Lam says she has caused “unforgivable havoc” by igniting the political crisis engulfing the city and would quit if she had a choice, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters of remarks she made to a group of businesspeople.  Sept. 3 - Lam says she had never asked the Chinese government to let her resign to end the Chinese-ruled city’s political crisis, responding to the Reuters report. 	Reuters

Spot gold fell 0.6% to $1,537.20 per ounce at 0728 GMT, but hovered near last week’s $1,554.56, its highest since April 2013.  U.S. gold futures were also down 0.6% at $1,546.6 an ounce.  Spot silver was up 0.5% at $19.33 per ounce, after hitting $19.57 earlier, its highest since September 2016.  U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in three years in August, data showed on Tuesday, renewing fears of a sharp economic slowdown and weighing on risk sentiment.  The weak data has the increased the possibility of interest rate cut in September, said Jigar Trivedi, a commodities analyst at Mumbai-based Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers, adding trade uncertainties will create buying momentum in gold and silver.  Traders have almost fully priced in a 25 basis point interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s meeting later this month, according to CME’s FedWatch tool.  Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion and weigh on the dollar. The dollar index was down 0.2% against a basket of currencies.  Since prices have rallied so sharply, there might be profit booking to the levels of $1,510-$1,515, Trivedi said.  Meanwhile, stock markets in Asia and Europe gained on the back of strong Chinese services sector growth and a report that indicated possible resolution to the Hong Kong protests.  On the trade front, U.S. President Donald Trump’s threatened on Tuesday that he would be “tougher” on Beijing in the second term if talks dragged on.  British lawmakers defeated Boris Johnson in parliament on Tuesday in a bid to prevent him taking the country out of the EU without a divorce agreement, prompting the prime minister to announce that he would immediately push for a snap election.  With no agreement on the U.S.-China trade front, investors remain nervous, said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, adding that uncertainties following the UK parliamentary vote are a positive for gold.  Spot gold faces a resistance at $1,546 per ounce, a break above which could lead to a gain into the range of $1,568-$1,595, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.  Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose 1.34% to 890.04 tonnes on Tuesday, their highest since November 2016.  Elsewhere, spot platinum rose 0.6% to $963.15 per ounce and palladium was down 0.1% at $1,540.25. 	Reuters

Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets of Hong Kong since mid-June in sometimes violent protests denouncing perceived creeping interference by Beijing. China denies the charge.  Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula guaranteeing its freedoms. China has suggested the same formula for Taiwan, which it considers an unruly, breakaway province.  Many in Taiwan have been closely watching Hong Kong and become increasingly wary of Beijing’s “reunification” agenda.       “I hope people can brainstorm together on how to win this war against Beijing’s white terror and authoritarian rule,” Lester Shum, one of the student leaders of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy “Umbrella” movement five years ago that foreshadowed the current unrest, told reporters in Taipei.  White terror is a common expression to describe anonymous acts that create a climate of fear.  “Friends in Taiwan are not bystanders of the movement inHong Kong. Taiwanese are participants,” he said. “China will definitely want to take over Taiwan after it takes over Hong Kong.”  Joshua Wong, one of the most visible leaders of the 2014movement, called for a mass rally.  “We hope Hong Kong can one day become Taiwan, a place with democracy and freedom,” he said.  Wong is on bail after he was arrested last week, charged with inciting and participating in an unauthorized assembly outside Hong Kong police headquarters on June 21.  Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said on Tuesday her administration was keeping a close eye on the Hong Kong crisis.  Beijing has accused Taipei of supporting the Hong Kong protests, an accusation Taiwan denies.  “Like the rest of the international community, when necessary and based on humanitarian concerns, we will provide necessary assistance to Hong Kong residents in Taiwan, and will not just stand on the sidelines and watch,” she said in a statement.   “The Republic of China (Taiwan) staunchly supports democracy and freedom in Hong Kong, and hopes that Hong Kong society can quickly restore stability.”   Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmaker Eddie Chu urged Taiwan authorities to come up with “humanitarian mechanism” to take in demonstrators from the city, after hundreds of arrests since the protests began.   “There could be even worse conflict to come in Hong Kong...We hope the Taiwan government and political parties can make preparations for that scenario,” he said.

Lithuania’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Chinese diplomats acted “in violation of public order” at the Aug. 23 event, which was organized to show solidarity with anti-Beijing protesters in Hong Kong.  A police spokesman told Reuters that two Chinese citizens were detained and fined 15 euros ($17) each after people waving Chinese flags agitated at the protest.   “We have information that some (Chinese) diplomats were more active than they should, and that is not acceptable,” Lithuania’s Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius told reporters, without giving further details or naming them.  China said on Tuesday its diplomats in Lithuania had not broken any laws.  At a daily press briefing in Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said it was “totally reasonable” for overseas Chinese to express opposition to the “violent and illegal behaviors in Hong Kong”, but he added that China hoped any patriotism could be shown in a “rational way”.  “Regarding the situation in Lithuania .. I can tell you that the Chinese diplomats there have been fulfilling their jobs based on the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. They have not violated local laws,” Geng added.  The event in Vilnius was held as activists formed human chains across Hong Kong, inspired by a similar protest against Soviet rule in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in 1989.  Mantas Adomenas, a member of parliament who organized the Vilnius protest, told Reuters that before police intervened, several Mandarin speakers with Chinese flags jostled activists and attempted to wrestle away their megaphone.  After the arrest of the two Chinese citizens, police were approached by people who showed embassy identification and asked for the detainees’ release, Adomenas said, citing witnesses in a version partly corroborated by the police spokesman.   “I reviewed filmed footage of the protest, and I saw that the Chinese ambassador was present at the sidelines, and was several times approached by people from the protest,” Adomenas added.  The unrest in Hong Kong began over a now-suspended extradition bill but quickly morphed into a wider pro-democracy movement resisting Chinese control of the former British-ruled territory.  	Reuters

Zara, owned by the world’s biggest clothing retailer Inditex (ITX.MC), made its statement late on Monday after Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao asked if closure of four Hong Kong Zara stores on Monday was in support of a student strike, prompting comment from millions of mainland social media users.       Zara said in its statement on China’s Weibo social media platform that it supported the “one country, two systems” policy under which China rules Hong Kong and said it had not supported strikes.   The brand became a top trending topic on Weibo, with one hashtag “Zara statement” viewed more than 170 million times as of Tuesday morning.  A source close to Inditex said on Tuesday that some Zara stores in Hong Kong had been forced to delay opening on Monday because staff had trouble getting to work due to transport problems linked to the protests, but that all Zara stores in Hong Kong opened eventually on Monday.  Thousands of Hong Kong university and school students boycotted class on Monday and rallied peacefully for democracy, following a weekend marred by some of the worst violence since unrest escalated more than three months ago.  Shops in Hong Kong have often shut their doors when protests are taking place nearby.  Foreign brands are under increasing pressure from Chinese consumers and regulators to fall into line on contentious issues around Chinese sovereignty and its territorial claims.   Inditex has hundreds of stores in China including other fashion brands like Massimo Dutti and Bershka alongside Zara. China is second only to domestic market Spain in number of stores for the retailer.  Many Western fashion brands have been forced to clarify their positions on Chinese sovereignty as the Hong Kong protests fuel nationalist fervor on social media.  Last month, a number of Chinese brand ambassadors of fashion labels from Coach to Givenchy severed ties with the companies over products which they said violated China’s sovereignty by identifying Hong Kong and Taiwan as countries.  Last year, Zara was criticized on Chinese social media for placing Taiwan, a self-ruled island that China sees as a break-away province, in a pull-down list of countries on its Chinese website.

At the closed-door meeting, Lam told the group that she now has “very limited” room to resolve the crisis because the unrest has become a national security and sovereignty issue for China amid rising tensions with the United States.  “If I have a choice,” she said, speaking in English, “the first thing is to quit, having made a deep apology.”  Lam’s dramatic and at times anguished remarks offer the clearest view yet into the thinking of the Chinese leadership as it navigates the unrest in Hong Kong, the biggest political crisis to grip the country since the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.    Hong Kong has been convulsed by sometimes violent protests and mass demonstrations since June, in response to a proposed law by Lam’s administration that would allow people suspected of crimes on the mainland to be extradited to face trial in Chinese courts. The law has been shelved, but Lam has been unable to end the upheaval. Protesters have expanded their demands to include complete withdrawal of the proposal, a concession her administration has so far refused. Large demonstrations wracked the city again over the weekend.  Lam suggested that Beijing had not yet reached a turning point. She said Beijing had not imposed any deadline for ending the crisis ahead of National Day celebrations scheduled for October 1. And she said China had “absolutely no plan” to deploy People’s Liberation Army troops on Hong Kong streets. World leaders have been closely watching whether China will send in the military to quell the protests, as it did a generation ago in the bloody Tiananmen crackdown in Beijing.  Lam noted, however, that she had few options once an issue had been elevated “to a national level,” a reference to the leadership in Beijing, “to a sort of sovereignty and security level, let alone in the midst of this sort of unprecedented tension between the two big economies in the world.”  In such a situation, she added, “the room, the political room for the chief executive who, unfortunately, has to serve two masters by constitution, that is the central people’s government and the people of Hong Kong, that political room for maneuvering is very, very, very limited.”  Three people who attended the meeting confirmed that Lam had made the comments in a talk that lasted about half an hour. A 24-minute recording of her remarks was obtained by Reuters. The meeting was one of a number of ""closed-door sessions"" that Lam said she has been doing ""with people from all walks of life"" in Hong Kong.Read a transcript of Carrie Lam's remarks  Responding to Reuters, a spokesman for Lam said she attended two events last week that included businesspeople, and that both were effectively private. “We are therefore not in a position to comment on what the Chief Executive has said at those events,” the spokesman said.  China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, a high-level agency under China’s cabinet, the State Council, did not respond to questions submitted by Reuters.  China’s State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.  The Hong Kong protests mark the biggest popular challenge to the rule of Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012. Xi is also grappling with an escalating strategic rivalry with the United States and a slowing economy. Tensions have risen as the world’s two biggest economies are embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade war. Disagreements over Taiwan and over China’s moves to tighten its control in the South China Sea have further frayed relations between Beijing and Washington.  Lam’s remarks are consistent with a Reuters report published on Friday that revealed how leaders in Beijing are effectively calling the shots on handling the crisis in Hong Kong. The Chinese government rejected a recent proposal by Lam to defuse the conflict that included withdrawing the extradition bill altogether, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  Asked about the report, China’s Foreign Ministry said that the central government “supports, respects and understands” Lam’s decision to suspend the bill. The Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid published by the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, denounced it as “fake.”  As protests escalated, Lam suspended the bill on June 15. Several weeks later, on July 9, she announced that it was “dead.” That failed to mollify the protesters, who expanded their demands to include an inquiry into police violence and democratic reform. Many have also called for an end to what they see as meddling by Beijing in the affairs of Hong Kong.  The tone of Lam’s comments in the recording is at odds with her more steely public visage. At times, she can be heard choking up as she reveals the personal impact of the three-month crisis.  “For a chief executive to have caused this huge havoc to Hong Kong is unforgivable,” she said.  Lam told the meeting that the leadership in Beijing was aware of the potential damage to China’s reputation that would arise from sending troops into Hong Kong to quell the protests.  “They know that the price would be too huge to pay,” she said.  “They care about the country’s international profile,” she said. “It has taken China a long time to build up to that sort of international profile and to have some say, not only being a big economy but a responsible big economy, so to forsake all those positive developments is clearly not on their agenda.”  But she said China was “willing to play long” to ride out the unrest, even if it meant economic pain for the city, including a drop in tourism and losing out on capital inflows such as initial public offerings.  Lam also spoke about the importance of the rule of law in Hong Kong and restoring stability to the city of more than seven million, as well as the need to improve efforts to get the government’s message out. At the end, applause can be heard on the recording.  While Lam said that now was not the time for “self-pity,” she spoke about her profound frustration with not being able “to reduce the pressure on my frontline police officers,” or to provide a political solution to “pacify the large number of peaceful protesters who are so angry with the government, with me in particular.”  Her inability “to offer a political situation in order to relieve the tension,” she said, was the source of her “biggest sadness.”  Lam also spoke about the impact the crisis has had on her daily life.  “Nowadays it is extremely difficult for me to go out,” she said. “I have not been on the streets, not in shopping malls, can’t go to a hair salon. I can’t do anything because my whereabouts will be spread around social media.”  If she were to appear in public, she said, “you could expect a big crowd of black T-shirts and black-masked young people waiting for me.” Many of the protesters wear black at demonstrations.  After enjoying relatively high popularity in the initial part of her tenure, Lam is now the least popular of any of the four leaders who have run Hong Kong since its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997, according to veteran pollster Robert Chung, who runs the Public Opinion Research Institute.  Lam was chosen as city leader in March 2017, vowing to “unite society” and heal divisions in Hong Kong, which remains by far the freest city under Chinese rule. Under the “one country, two systems” formula agreed with Britain, Hong Kong enjoys an array of personal freedoms that don’t exist in mainland China. One of the most cherished of those freedoms is the city’s British-style system of independent courts and rule of law. The protesters say the extradition law would erode that bulwark of liberty.  According to a biography on the Hong Kong government website, Lam, a devout Catholic, attended St Francis’ Canossian College. Her mother, who took care of seven family members on a daily basis, was her role model and inspiration, the biography said. An election manifesto said Lam came from a “grassroots” family and did her homework on a bunk-bed. After studying sociology at the University of Hong Kong, she went on to a distinguished career as a civil servant in Hong Kong. She was elected city leader in March 2017 by a 1,200-member election committee stacked with Beijing loyalists.  In her early days as leader, Lam pushed through a series of controversial government policies, drawing public criticism in Hong Kong but winning praise from Chinese leader Xi Jinping.  On July 1, 2017, the day she was sworn in, Lam donned a white hard hat as she walked with Xi to inspect the new Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge, which physically links Hong Kong to mainland China. Critics say the bridge could further weaken Hong Kong’s autonomy by deepening its physical links with southern China.  The effective expulsion last year of Financial Times editor Victor Mallet, whose visa wasn’t renewed after he hosted an event at the city’s Foreign Correspondents’ Club with the leader of the pro-independence Hong Kong National Party, also drew condemnation at home and abroad. Lam and her government later came under fire for banning the party and the disqualification of pro-democracy lawmakers.

She expressed deep regrets about her push to pass the bill. “This has proven to be very unwise given the circumstances,” she said. “And this huge degree of fear and anxiety amongst people of Hong Kong vis-à-vis the mainland of China, which we were not sensitive enough to feel and grasp.”  She gave her audience a gloomy outlook.

Zara, owned by the world’s biggest clothing retailer Inditex (ITX.MC), made its statement late on Monday after Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao asked if closure of four Hong Kong Zara stores on Monday was in support of a student strike, prompting comment from millions of mainland social media users.       Zara said in its statement on China’s Weibo social media platform that it supported the “one country, two systems” policy under which China rules Hong Kong and said it had not supported strikes.   The brand became a top trending topic on Weibo, with one hashtag “Zara statement” viewed more than 170 million times as of Tuesday morning.  A source close to Inditex said on Tuesday that some Zara stores in Hong Kong had been forced to delay opening on Monday because staff had trouble getting to work due to transport problems linked to the protests, but that all Zara stores in Hong Kong opened eventually on Monday.  Thousands of Hong Kong university and school students boycotted class on Monday and rallied peacefully for democracy, following a weekend marred by some of the worst violence since unrest escalated more than three months ago.  Shops in Hong Kong have often shut their doors when protests are taking place nearby.  Foreign brands are under increasing pressure from Chinese consumers and regulators to fall into line on contentious issues around Chinese sovereignty and its territorial claims.   Inditex has hundreds of stores in China including other fashion brands like Massimo Dutti and Bershka alongside Zara. China is second only to domestic market Spain in number of stores for the retailer.  Many Western fashion brands have been forced to clarify their positions on Chinese sovereignty as the Hong Kong protests fuel nationalist fervor on social media.  Last month, a number of Chinese brand ambassadors of fashion labels from Coach to Givenchy severed ties with the companies over products which they said violated China’s sovereignty by identifying Hong Kong and Taiwan as countries.  Last year, Zara was criticized on Chinese social media for placing Taiwan, a self-ruled island that China sees as a break-away province, in a pull-down list of countries on its Chinese website.

At the closed-door meeting, Lam told the group that she now has “very limited” room to resolve the crisis because the unrest has become a national security and sovereignty issue for China amid rising tensions with the United States.  “If I have a choice,” she said, speaking in English, “the first thing is to quit, having made a deep apology.”  Lam’s dramatic and at times anguished remarks offer the clearest view yet into the thinking of the Chinese leadership as it navigates the unrest in Hong Kong, the biggest political crisis to grip the country since the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.  Hong Kong has been convulsed by sometimes violent protests and mass demonstrations since June, in response to a proposed law by Lam’s administration that would allow people suspected of crimes on the mainland to be extradited to face trial in Chinese courts. The law has been shelved, but Lam has been unable to end the upheaval. Protesters have expanded their demands to include complete withdrawal of the proposal, a concession her administration has so far refused. Large demonstrations wracked the city again over the weekend.  Lam suggested that Beijing had not yet reached a turning point. She said Beijing had not imposed any deadline for ending the crisis ahead of National Day celebrations scheduled for October 1. And she said China had “absolutely no plan” to deploy People’s Liberation Army troops on Hong Kong streets. World leaders have been closely watching whether China will send in the military to quell the protests, as it did a generation ago in the bloody Tiananmen crackdown in Beijing.  Lam noted, however, that she had few options once an issue had been elevated “to a national level,” a reference to the leadership in Beijing, “to a sort of sovereignty and security level, let alone in the midst of this sort of unprecedented tension between the two big economies in the world.”  In such a situation, she added, “the room, the political room for the chief executive who, unfortunately, has to serve two masters by constitution, that is the central people’s government and the people of Hong Kong, that political room for maneuvering is very, very, very limited.”  Three people who attended the meeting confirmed that Lam had made the comments in a talk that lasted about half an hour. A 24-minute recording of her remarks was reviewed by Reuters. The meeting was one of a number of “closed-door sessions” that Lam said she has been doing “with people from all walks of life” in Hong Kong.  Responding to Reuters, a spokesman for Lam said she attended two events last week that included businesspeople, and that both were effectively private. “We are therefore not in a position to comment on what the Chief Executive has said at those events,” the spokesman said.  China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, a high-level agency under China’s cabinet, the State Council, did not respond to questions submitted by Reuters.  China’s State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.  The Hong Kong protests mark the biggest popular challenge to the rule of Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012. Xi is also grappling with an escalating strategic rivalry with the United States and a slowing economy. Tensions have risen as the world’s two biggest economies are embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade war. Disagreements over Taiwan and over China’s moves to tighten its control in the South China Sea have further frayed relations between Beijing and Washington.  Lam’s remarks are consistent with a Reuters report published on Friday that revealed how leaders in Beijing are effectively calling the shots on handling the crisis in Hong Kong. The Chinese government rejected a recent proposal by Lam to defuse the conflict that included withdrawing the extradition bill altogether, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  Asked about the report, China’s Foreign Ministry said that the central government “supports, respects and understands” Lam’s decision to suspend the bill. The Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid published by the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, denounced it as “fake.”  As protests escalated, Lam suspended the bill on June 15. Several weeks later, on July 9, she announced that it was “dead.” That failed to mollify the protesters, who expanded their demands to include an inquiry into police violence and democratic reform. Many have also called for an end to what they see as meddling by Beijing in the affairs of Hong Kong.  The tone of Lam’s comments in the recording is at odds with her more steely public visage. At times, she can be heard choking up as she reveals the personal impact of the three-month crisis.  “For a chief executive to have caused this huge havoc to Hong Kong is unforgivable,” she said.  Lam told the meeting that the leadership in Beijing was aware of the potential damage to China’s reputation that would arise from sending troops into Hong Kong to quell the protests.  “They know that the price would be too huge to pay,” she said.  “They care about the country’s international profile,” she said. “It has taken China a long time to build up to that sort of international profile and to have some say, not only being a big economy but a responsible big economy, so to forsake all those positive developments is clearly not on their agenda.”  But she said China was “willing to play long” to ride out the unrest, even if it meant economic pain for the city, including a drop in tourism and losing out on capital inflows such as initial public offerings.  Lam also spoke about the importance of the rule of law in Hong Kong and restoring stability to the city of more than seven million, as well as the need to improve efforts to get the government’s message out. At the end, applause can be heard on the recording.  While Lam said that now was not the time for “self-pity,” she spoke about her profound frustration with not being able “to reduce the pressure on my frontline police officers,” or to provide a political solution to “pacify the large number of peaceful protesters who are so angry with the government, with me in particular.”  Her inability “to offer a political situation in order to relieve the tension,” she said, was the source of her “biggest sadness.”  Lam also spoke about the impact the crisis has had on her daily life.  “Nowadays it is extremely difficult for me to go out,” she said. “I have not been on the streets, not in shopping malls, can’t go to a hair salon. I can’t do anything because my whereabouts will be spread around social media.”  If she were to appear in public, she said, “you could expect a big crowd of black T-shirts and black-masked young people waiting for me.” Many of the protesters wear black at demonstrations.  After enjoying relatively high popularity in the initial part of her tenure, Lam is now the least popular of any of the four leaders who have run Hong Kong since its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997, according to veteran pollster Robert Chung, who runs the Public Opinion Research Institute.  Lam was chosen as city leader in March 2017, vowing to “unite society” and heal divisions in Hong Kong, which remains by far the freest city under Chinese rule. Under the “one country, two systems” formula agreed with Britain, Hong Kong enjoys an array of personal freedoms that don’t exist in mainland China. One of the most cherished of those freedoms is the city’s British-style system of independent courts and rule of law. The protesters say the extradition law would erode that bulwark of liberty.  According to a biography on the Hong Kong government website, Lam, a devout Catholic, attended St Francis’ Canossian College. Her mother, who took care of seven family members on a daily basis, was her role model and inspiration, the biography said. An election manifesto said Lam came from a “grassroots” family and did her homework on a bunk-bed. After studying sociology at the University of Hong Kong, she went on to a distinguished career as a civil servant in Hong Kong. She was elected city leader in March 2017 by a 1,200-member election committee stacked with Beijing loyalists.  In her early days as leader, Lam pushed through a series of controversial government policies, drawing public criticism in Hong Kong but winning praise from Chinese leader Xi Jinping.  On July 1, 2017, the day she was sworn in, Lam donned a white hard hat as she walked with Xi to inspect the new Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge, which physically links Hong Kong to mainland China. Critics say the bridge could further weaken Hong Kong’s autonomy by deepening its physical links with southern China.  The effective expulsion last year of Financial Times editor Victor Mallet, whose visa wasn’t renewed after he hosted an event at the city’s Foreign Correspondents’ Club with the leader of the pro-independence Hong Kong National Party, also drew condemnation at home and abroad. Lam and her government later came under fire for banning the party and the disqualification of pro-democracy lawmakers.  Xi praised Lam’s leadership during a visit to Beijing in December 2018. “The central government fully endorses the work of Chief Executive Lam” and the Hong Kong government, Xi said, according to a report in the state news agency Xinhua.

The police, she said, would continue to arrest those responsible for “this escalating violence,” a group that the government initially estimated numbered between one thousand and two thousand.  It would be “naïve,” she said, to “paint you a rosy picture, that things will be fine.” She did, however, express hope in the city’s ultimate “resurrection.”  “Hong Kong is not dead yet.

The E-mini futures for U.S. S&P500 fell as much as 1.06% in early trade and last stood down 0.39% while U.S. Treasuries futures prices rose a tad.  Volumes remained thin in Asia ahead of a U.S. public holiday and European shares are expected to open little changed, with pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 futures almost flat in early Monday trade.  MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.24%, led by 0.5% drop in Hong Kong’s Hang Seng after another weekend of violent anti-government protests.  Chinese shares, however, bucked the bearish trend, with the CSI300 index rising 1.1% despite the trade row escalation. Providing some tailwind to mainland markets was a pledge by China’s State Council to boost support for the economy.  Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), a private sector survey, on Monday showed factory activity unexpectedly expanded in August, though gains were modest and contrasted with official data that pointed to further contraction.  “It’s clear that Beijing is willing to support the economy through fiscal stimulus,” said Kenji Hashizume, senior fund manager at Mitsui Sumitomo DS Asset Management in Hong Kong.  “While I do not expect the Sino-U.S. relations to keep deteriorating, it won’t be solved easily either,” he said.  Washington slapped 15% tariffs on a variety of Chinese goods on Sunday - including footwear, smart watches and flat-panel televisions - while Beijing imposed new duties on U.S. crude, the latest escalation in a bruising trade war.  Several studies suggest the tariffs will cost U.S. households up to $1,000 a year, with the latest round hitting a significant number of U.S. consumer goods.  In retaliation, China started to impose additional tariffs on some of the U.S. goods on a $75 billion target list. Beijing did not specify the value of the goods that face higher tariffs from Sunday.  Although U.S. President Donald Trump has said the two countries will hold talks in September, there are doubts any such talks would lead to a breakthrough.  “So far Trump appears defiant though on the tariff hikes, blaming the Fed and American companies for their difficulties in dealing with the tariffs,” said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP in Sydney.  “There is a long way to go though and re-establishing trust will be difficult after the experience since mid-last year. Share markets may still have to fall further to pressure Trump to resolve the issue.”  Many market players say the market’s reaction was likely exaggerated by algorithm-driven players’ flows in thin trading conditions at start of Asian trade on Monday.  Liquidity could be even more limited than usual because of a U.S. market holiday on Monday.  “(The market move) goes to show you how many data mining algos are involved with equity linked compared to forex-linked. Was anyone surprised by these tariffs that took effect yesterday?” said Takeo Kamai, head of execution at CLSA in Tokyo.  Tension is also running high in Hong Kong, with police and protesters clashing in some of the most intense violence since unrest erupted more than three months ago over concerns Beijing is undermining democratic freedoms in the territory.  Thousands of protesters blocked roads and public transport links to Hong Kong airport and police made several arrests after demonstrators smashed CCTV cameras and lamps with metal poles and dismantled station turnstiles.  China, eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1, has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.  Oil prices also fell on Monday.  Brent crude futures fell 0.37% to $59.03 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were almost flat at $55.15.  In currency markets, the dollar dipped slightly against the yen to 106.12 yen. 	Reuters

The E-mini futures for U.S. S&P500 fell as much as 1.06% in early trade and last stood down 0.68% at 2,905 while Chicago-traded Nikkei futures suggest Japan’s Nikkei is on course to fall 0.7%.  MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan , which lost 4.7% last month, is likely to stay under pressure.  The United States slapped 15% tariffs on a variety of Chinese goods on Sunday - including footwear, smart watches and flat-panel televisions - while China imposed new duties on U.S. crude, the latest escalation in a bruising trade war.  A variety of studies suggest the tariffs will cost U.S. households up to $1,000 a year and the latest round will hit a significant number of U.S. consumer goods.  In retaliation, China started to impose additional tariffs on some of the U.S. goods on a $75 billion target list. Beijing did not specify the value of the goods that face higher tariffs from Sunday.  Many market players say the market’s reaction was likely exaggerated by algorithm-driven players’ flows in thin trading conditions at start of Asian trade on Monday.  Liquidity could be even more limited than usual because of a U.S. market holiday on Monday.  “(The market move) goes to show you how many data mining algos are involved with equity linked compared to forex-linked. Was anyone surprised by these tariffs that took effect yesterday?” said Takeo Kamai, head of execution at CLSA in Tokyo.  Despite the volatility, the moves lower reflect investors’ underlying worries about increasing costs of Sino-U.S. trade war on the global economy.  An official survey published on Saturday showed factory activity in China shrank in August for the fourth month in a row, further evidence of hit to the world’s second-largest economy from trade war.  Tension is also running high in Hong Kong, with police and protesters clashing in some of the most intense violence since unrest erupted more than three months ago over concerns Beijing is undermining democratic freedoms in the territory.  Thousands of protesters blocked roads and public transport links to Hong Kong airport and police made several arrests after demonstrators smashed CCTV cameras and lamps with metal poles and dismantled station turnstiles.  China, eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1, has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.  Oil prices also fell in early Monday trade.  Brent crude futures fell 0.68% to $58.85 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude lost 0.54% to $54.80 per barrel.  The currency market was calmer for now, with the dollar down slightly against the yen at 106.12 yen, down 0.13% from late U.S. levels. 	Reuters

Planes were taking off and landing, with delays, but trains were suspended and approach roads to the airport impassable as protesters erected barricades and overturned trolleys at the airport and in the nearby new town of Tung Chung.  Some passengers were forced to walk the last bit of their journey to the airport by foot, dragging luggage behind them.  The MTR subway station in Tung Chung was closed and demonstrators smashed CCTV cameras and lamps with metal poles and dismantled station turnstiles. Police moved in and made several arrests.  Chek Lap Kok, built around a tiny outlying island in the dying days of British colonial rule, is one of the world’s busiest and most efficient airports, reached by a series of bridges which were packed with traffic.  “If we disrupt the airport, more foreigners will read the news about Hong Kong,” said one 20-year-old protester, asking not to be named.  Black-clad demonstrators targeted the airport three weeks ago, jamming the terminal in sometimes violent clashes with police and prompting some flights to be canceled or delayed.  Police said on Sunday protesters hurled iron poles, bricks and rocks on to the railway track near the airport station. By early evening protesters at the airport had left, but protesters in Tung Chung remained.   “We have no idea how to leave. We’re stuck,” a masked protester said, as others looked for buses and ferries to get back home.  Police and protesters had clashed overnight in some of the most intense violence since unrest erupted more than three months ago over concerns Beijing is eroding the autonomy granted to the territory when it was handed back to China in 1997.  China denies the charge of meddling and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests and warned of the damage to the economy.  Tourist numbers have plummeted in recent weeks and international trade fairs canceled as the territory faces its first recession in a decade.  China is eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.  Several hundred demonstrators also gathered outside the British consulate in central Hong Kong, waving Union Jack flags and chanting “God save the Queen”.  Parts of the metro system ground to a halt as skirmishes spread to the subway on Saturday, with television showing images of people being beaten as they cowered on the floor behind umbrellas. Police said they arrested 63 people aged between 13 and 36.  Amnesty International said the metro violence should be investigated.  The protests came on the fifth anniversary of China’s decision to curtail democratic reforms and rule out universal suffrage in Hong Kong.  The unrest began in mid-June, fueled by anger over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people in the city to be sent to China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.  But the turmoil has evolved over 13 weeks to become a widespread demand for greater democracy.   Protesters have called for a general strike on Monday, but it was not immediately clear how many people would take part. 	Reuters

Protest organisers have urged the public to overwhelm road and rail links to the airport on Sunday and Monday, potentially disrupting flights. A similar so-called “stress test” of the airport last weekend failed.  Late on Saturday and into the early hours, police fired tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets and protesters threw petrol bombs, escalating clashes that have plunged the Asian financial centre into its worst political crisis in decades.  Officers fired two warning shots in the air to scare off a group of protesters who had them surrounded and were trying to steal their pistols, the police said, only the second time live rounds have been used in more than three months of unrest.  Parts of the metro system ground to a halt as skirmishes spread to the subway, with television showing images of people being beaten as they cowered on the floor behind umbrellas. Three stations remained closed on Sunday morning.  “A large group of protesters participated in unlawful assembly in various districts since yesterday, despite police’s objection and warning,” the police said in a statement.  “The level of violence is rapidly escalating and their illegal acts have no regard to the laws of Hong Kong.”  The protests, which at one point blocked three key roads, came on the fifth anniversary of China’s decision to curtail democratic reforms and rule out universal suffrage in Hong Kong, a former British colony that was returned in 1997.  The unrest began in mid-June, fuelled by anger over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people in the city to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.  But the unrest has evolved over 13 straight weeks into a widespread demand for greater democracy in a territory that many residents believe is increasingly being controlled by Beijing.

510	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1VK2NI	August 30, 2019 /  11:08 PM / 7 months ago	Exclusive: Messaging app Telegram moves to protect identity of Hong Kong protesters	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Telegram, a popular encrypted messaging app, will allow users to cloak their telephone numbers to safeguard Hong Kong protesters against monitoring by authorities, according to a person with direct knowledge of the effort.  The update to Telegram, planned for release over the next few days, will allow protesters to prevent mainland Chinese and Hong Kong authorities from discovering their identities in the app’s large group chats.   Hong Kong’s Security Bureau told Reuters it has “been acting responsibly to deal with the current difficult time with a view to restoring the public order”. It declined to comment about whether it had tried to identify protesters by using the Telegram app.   China’s Foreign Ministry, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of business hours.   Thousands of Hong Kong protesters take their cues from more than 100 groups on Telegram, according to protest organizers and supporters. Protesters use encrypted apps like Telegram to mobilize swiftly through multiple group chats, with less risk of police infiltration, an in-depth report published by Reuters earlier this month said.   The groups are used to post everything from news on upcoming protests to tips on dousing tear gas canisters fired by the police to the identities of suspected undercover police and the access codes to buildings in Hong Kong where protesters can hide.  Some protesters express concern that authorities could use the movement’s reliance on Telegram to monitor and arrest organizers. Telegram chat groups used to organize public protests are often accessible to anyone and participants use pseudonyms.   Telegram allows users to search for other users by uploading phone numbers. This function allows a new user to quickly learn whether those in a phone’s contact book are already using the app, the group said.   Some protesters say they believe Chinese or Hong Kong security officials have exploited the function by uploading large quantities of phone numbers. Reuters was unable to determine if this has occurred.    The app automatically matches phone numbers with the user names in the group. Authorities then only need to request the owners of the phone numbers from the local telecom service in order to learn the users’ true identities.   Telegram has detected evidence that Hong Kong or mainland Chinese authorities may have uploaded numbers to identify protesters, said the person with direct knowledge of the situation. But it is unclear whether authorities have successfully used this tactic to locate protesters.   Telegram did not respond to a request for comment.   A group of Hong Kong engineers who posted their finding on an online forum earlier this month also said that a feature in Telegram’s design may have allowed mainland Chinese or Hong Kong authorities to learn the real identities of users.   The fix Telegram is working on would allow users to disable matching by phone number. That option represents a balance between making it easy for users to find their contacts and the privacy needs of those who rely on the app for protection against state security agents, the source said.  But wide adoption of the optional security setting would make the app far harder to use for the vast majority of its more than 200 million consumers, who rely on uploading phone contacts to identify friends and family members on the app, the source said.  In June, Telegram chief executive Pavel Durov said the messaging service experienced a “state actor-sized” cyber attack and pointed to China as its likely country of origin.   He provided no further details but said the attack coincided with protests in Hong Kong. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) did not respond to a faxed request for comment at the time.    The move by Telegram comes as Hong Kong police arrested a number of prominent activists and three lawmakers on Friday. Nearly 900 people have been arrested since the demonstrations began three months ago. 	Reuters

The U.S. president, who has alternated between expressing optimism about a trade deal and criticism of China for its economic policies, also said he thought the trade talks had led Beijing to be more restrained in its response to demonstrations in Hong Kong.  A tit-for-tat tariff war between the world’s two largest economies now involves hundreds of billions of dollars of each country’s goods and threatens global economic growth. Uncertainty about when or how the dispute could end has roiled markets and complicated corporations’ long-term investment plans.  “We’re going to win the fight,” Trump told reporters. “We’re having conversations with China, meetings are scheduled, calls are being made. I guess the meeting in September continues to be on, it hasn’t been canceled,” he said.  The White House has not announced a date for that meeting.  Tariffs kick in on an additional $125 billion in Chinese goods over the weekend, and Trump said that had not been changed despite more conciliatory language between the two sides in recent days.  “They’re on,” Trump said of the tariffs.  Both sides are maintaining effective communication, China’s Foreign Ministry said earlier on Friday.  The United States will begin collecting a 15% tariff on an estimated $125 billion of Chinese goods at 12:01 a.m. EDT (0401 GMT) on Sunday, including smartwatches, flat panel televisions and footwear.   There will be no grace period on those tariffs for goods in transit, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency said on Friday. Tariffs have been imposed on $250 billion of Chinese products so far since the trade war began in 2018, and U.S. trade groups and manufacturers have criticized the policies for hurting profits.   “A lot of badly run companies are trying to blame tariffs,” Trump said.  “It’s not the tariffs, it’s called bad management,” Trump added.   Trump earlier on Friday denied that the tariffs were affecting the U.S. economy.  “We don’t have a Tariff problem (we are reigning in bad and/or unfair players), we have a Fed problem. They don’t have a clue!” the Republican president, seeking re-election in 2020, wrote in a Twitter post.  Trump has criticized the U.S. Federal Reserve and its leadership for not lowering interest rates further to stimulate the economy. Asked on Friday if he wanted negative interest rates, he said no.  Trump said General Motors Co (GM.N) should begin moving its operations in China, where it started joint ventures in 1997, back to the United States.  “General Motors, which was once the Giant of Detroit, is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there. They moved major plants to China, BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE,” Trump tweeted. “This was done despite the saving help given them by the USA. Now they should start moving back to America again?”  Bilateral trade talks could be complicated by Beijing’s response to widespread protests in Hong Kong. Trump has tied the two together before, saying earlier this month he believed Chinese President Xi Jinping wanted a trade deal, but that Xi should “quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem.”   On Friday, Hong Kong police arrested several pro-democracy activists ahead of a mass demonstration planned for this weekend. Earlier this summer, Beijing rebuffed a Hong Kong government proposal to appease protesters.   Trump said on Friday evening that he thought Beijing’s response to Hong Kong protests would be more violent if it were not for the trade talks. “China really wants to make a deal,” he said, and that’s “keeping down the temperature in Hong Kong.”  Asked if he plans to speak to Xi, Trump demurred. “That I can’t tell you, but we are speaking to China, But I can’t tell you whether or not it’s going to be President Xi,” Trump said.

U.S. retailers have been worried about the cost of the bitter trade war with President Donald Trump’s latest plans to further hike tariffs on Chinese goods imported to the U.S.   The Trump administration on Wednesday made official its extra 5% tariff on $300 billion in Chinese imports and set collection dates of Sept. 1 and Dec. 15.  PVH, which imported about $400 million of inventory from the Asian country last year, said the tariff is expected to hit its earnings by about 20 cents per share in 2019.   Adding to the company’s worries are the increasing promotions by retailers and department store operators in the domestic U.S. market as they grapple with sluggish sales due to a fall in tourist spending as well as the months of political turmoil in Hong Kong.      PVH now expects full-year adjusted profit between $9.30 per share and $9.40 per share compared to prior estimate of $10.20 per share to $10.30 per share.   The company also cut its full-year revenue forecast to about 1% growth, down from its prior outlook of about 3% rise.   Chief Executive Officer Emanuel Chirico said the volatility in the macro environment, the global retail landscape and the continuing escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China will cause its business to remain under pressure, as will the ongoing impact of protests in Hong Kong.  Despite the dull outlook, PVH reported better-than-expected quarterly sales boosted by higher demand for its Tommy Hilfiger apparels. Sales in the brand, its biggest revenue generator, rose 8% to $1.11 billion.  Overall, revenue rose 1.3% to $2.36 billion, beating the average analyst estimates of $2.33 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Net income attributable to the company rose to $193.5 million, or $2.58 per share, in the second quarter ended Aug. 4, from $165.2 million, or $2.12 per share, a year earlier.   Excluding items, the company earned $2.10 per share. Analysts, on average, had estimated a profit of $1.88 per share.  Shares of the New-York based company fell marginally in after market trading.

The New York-based company also said it would stick to its full-year forecast for a slight increase in sales.  A protracted U.S-China trade war, strong dollar and a stricter U.S. visa approval process have contributed to a near 3% drop in Chinese citizens arriving in the United States this year, pressuring American retailers that are reliant on the high-spending tourists.      Tiffany’s shares were up 3.5% at $85.42 in afternoon trading.  Protests disrupted traffic at Tiffany’s stores in Hong Kong, prompting six days of unplanned closures. If the unrest continues or the situation worsens, full-year sales and earnings could come in at the lower end of forecasts, the company warned on a call with analysts.  Tiffany has 10 stores in Hong Kong, its fourth-largest market.  Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo told Reuters that even as currency headwinds and disruptions in Hong Kong persisted, sales in mainland China were robust.  “There is little we can do on tourist slows around the world so our way to react to this is to continue to be more active locally, domestically in China where customers are,” Bogliolo said.  The company is renovating and expanding its flagship store in Shanghai, and a flagship store in Hong Kong is set to open in September. In a bid to lure in new customers and maintain current ones, the company will feature Tiffany Blue Box Cafes in both locations.  The retailer said it will also open and expand certain airport stores in China and Hong Kong.  SECOND-HALF MARKETING  Tiffany said expenses fell 5% in the quarter, as it suspended much of its digital marketing while revamping its websites. But the company said it expects to spend more on marketing in the second half of the year to entice younger shoppers into its stores and continues to renovate its flagship shop in Manhattan.

The New York-based company also said it would stick to its full-year forecast for a slight increase in sales.  A protracted U.S-China trade war, strong dollar and a stricter U.S. visa approval process have contributed to a near 3% drop in Chinese citizens arriving in the United States this year, pressuring American retailers that are reliant on the high-spending tourists.      Tiffany’s shares were up 3.5% at $85.42 in afternoon trading.  Protests disrupted traffic at Tiffany’s stores in Hong Kong, prompting six days of unplanned closures. If the unrest continues or the situation worsens, full-year sales and earnings could come in at the lower end of forecasts, the company warned on a call with analysts.  Tiffany has 10 stores in Hong Kong, its fourth-largest market.  Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo told Reuters that even as currency headwinds and disruptions in Hong Kong persisted, sales in mainland China were robust.  “There is little we can do on tourist slows around the world so our way to react to this is to continue to be more active locally, domestically in China where customers are,” Bogliolo said.  The company is renovating and expanding its flagship store in Shanghai, and a flagship store in Hong Kong is set to open in September. In a bid to lure in new customers and maintain current ones, the company will feature Tiffany Blue Box Cafes in both locations.  The retailer said it will also open and expand certain airport stores in China and Hong Kong.  SECOND-HALF MARKETING  Tiffany said expenses fell 5% in the quarter, as it suspended much of its digital marketing while revamping its websites. But the company said it expects to spend more on marketing in the second half of the year to entice younger shoppers into its stores and continues to renovate its flagship shop in Manhattan.

The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU) switched the protest venue, originally planned to be outside the airline’s airport headquarters, Cathay City, to the central financial district after police refused permission.  The airport was forced to close two weeks ago after protesters thronged the arrivals hall for days, grounding about 1,000 flights and occasionally clashing with police.  Cathay was targeted for sacking 20 pilots and cabin crew and what staff have described as “white terror”, a phrase used to describe anonymous acts that create a climate of fear.  “Revoke termination, stop terrorizing CX staff,” proclaimed a black banner in English at the protest site where at least 2,000 gathered peacefully. “Uphold our freedom of speech.”  CX is airline code for Cathay.  The airline has been caught in the crosswinds between authorities in Beijing and protesters who have staged sometimes violent demonstrations since June that have grown into the biggest challenge for authorities in the former British colony since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  China has denounced the protests and accused the United States and Britain of interfering in its affairs in Hong Kong. It has sent a clear warning that forceful intervention is possible.  Rebecca Sy, former head of a flight attendants’ association, said she was fired without explanation after managers saw her Facebook account.  “We never faced any disciplinary action from the company before. How come now they just terminate me without any valid reason? By simply showing me those printouts of my own private Facebook account?”  China’s aviation regulator demanded Cathay suspend staff from flying over its airspace if they were involved in, or supported, the demonstrations. At least 20 pilots and cabin crew have since been fired, the HKCTU said.  Cathay’s director for corporate affairs, James Tong, said the Civil Aviation Administration of China had issued a directive “with regards to new safety and security measures” with which the airline was bound to comply.   “We fully support the upholding of the Basic Law and all the rights and freedoms afforded by it. At the same time, we are also required to adhere to all of our regulatory duties, including those prescribed by the authorities in mainland China. The airline must do this; there is no ground for compromise.”  The Basic Law is the mini-constitution under which Hong Kong is ruled.  The protests in the Asian financial hub have posed the biggest challenge for Communist Party rulers in Beijing since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012.   Unrest escalated in mid-June over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts.  It has since evolved into calls for greater democracy under the “one country, two systems” formula under which Hong Kong has been administered since 1997, guaranteeing freedoms that include an independent judiciary.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, attending a ceremony celebrating the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1, said “we must stop violence” by the rule of law.  “Facing the current escalation of violence and the massive destructive actions by radical demonstrators, we must strengthen our confidence and act as a defender of ‘one country, two systems’,” she said.  But Lam has not ruled out the possibility of invoking emergency powers.  A mannequin dressed as a Cathay flight attendant held a sign saying “all five demands must be fulfilled”, referring to the broader protest calls to withdraw the extradition bill, set up an independent inquiry into complaints of police brutality, stop describing the protests as riots, waive charges against those arrested and resume political reform.  Thousands also gathered to protest against what demonstrators say is sexual violence by police. It has been dubbed the “#MeToo” rally and some wrote “#ProtestToo” on their arms with red lipstick.  Police said they respected the rights of people in detention and were aware of online “rumors” that a person had been sexually harassed, which they said were false.  Hong Kong is on the verge of its first recession in a decade, weighed down by the protests and a prolonged U.S.-China trade war. 	Reuters

523	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1VH2JT	August 27, 2019 /  11:03 PM / 7 months ago	'Now or never': Hong Kong protesters say they have nothing to lose	HONG KONG (Reuters) - Exasperated with the government’s unflinching attitude to escalating civil unrest, Jason Tse quit his job in Australia and jumped on a plane to join what he believes is a do-or-die fight for Hong Kong’s future.   The Chinese territory is grappling with its biggest crisis since its handover to Beijing 22 years ago as many residents fret over what they see as China’s tightening grip over the city and a relentless march toward mainland control.   The battle for Hong Kong’s soul has pitted protesters against the former British colony’s political masters in Beijing, with broad swathes of the Asian financial center determined to defend the territory’s freedoms at any cost.  Faced with a stick and no carrot - chief executive Carrie Lam reiterated on Tuesday protesters’ demands were unacceptable - the pro-democracy movement has intensified despite Beijing deploying paramilitary troops near the border in recent weeks.  “This is a now or never moment and it is the reason why I came back,” Tse, 32, said, adding that since joining the protests last month he had been a peaceful participant in rallies and an activist on the Telegram social media app.  “If we don’t succeed now, our freedom of speech, our human rights, all will be gone. We need to persist.”  Since the city returned to Chinese rule in 1997, critics say Beijing has reneged on a commitment to maintain Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms under a “one country, two systems” formula.  Opposition to Beijing that had dwindled after 2014, when authorities faced down a pro-democracy movement that occupied streets for 79 days, has come back to haunt authorities who are now grappling with an escalating cycle of violence.   “We have to keep fighting. Our worst fear is the Chinese government,” said a 40-year-old teacher who declined to be identified for fear of repercussions.   “For us, it’s a life or death situation.”  What started as protests against a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party, has evolved into demands for greater democracy.   “We lost the revolution in 2014 very badly. This time, if not for the protesters who insist on using violence, the bill would have been passed already,” said another protester, who asked to be identified as just Mike, 30, who works in media and lives with his parents.   He was referring to the 79 days of largely peaceful protests in 2014 that led to the jailing of activist leaders.  “It’s proven that violence, to some degree, will be useful.”  Nearly 900 people have been arrested in the latest protests. The prospect of lengthy jail terms seems to be deterring few activists, many of whom live in tiny apartments with their families.  “7K for a house like a cell and you really think we out here scared of jail,” reads graffiti scrawled near one protest site. HK$7,000 ($893) is what the monthly rent for a tiny room in a shared apartment could cost.  The protests pose a direct challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, whose government has sent a clear warning that forceful intervention to quell violent demonstrations is possible.  Some critics question the protesters’ “now or never” rallying cry, saying a crackdown by Beijing could bring an end to the freedoms in Hong Kong that people on the mainland can only dream of.  The campaign reflects concerns over Hong Kong’s future at a time when protesters, many of whom were toddlers when Britain handed Hong Kong back to Beijing, feel they have been denied any political outlet and have no choice but to push for universal suffrage.  “You either stand up and pull this government down or you stay at the mercy of their hands. You have no choice,” said Cheng, 28, who works in the hospitality industry.  “Imagine if this fails. You can only imagine the dictatorship of the Communists will become even greater ... If we burn, you burn with us,” he said, referring to authorities in Beijing.    “The clock is ticking,” Cheng added, referring to 2047 when a 50-year agreement enshrining Hong Kong’s separate governing system will lapse.  As Beijing seeks to integrate Hong Kong closer to the mainland China, many residents are recoiling.  A poll in June by the University of Hong Kong found that 53% of 1,015 respondents identified as Hong Kongers, while 11% identified as Chinese, a record low since 1997.   With the prospect of owning a home in one of the world’s most expensive cities a dream, many disaffected youth say they have little to look forward to as Beijing’s grip tightens.   “We really have got nothing to lose,” said Scarlett, 23, a translator.  As the crisis simmers, China’s People’s Liberation Army has released footage of troops conducting anti-riot exercises.  But graffiti scrawled across the city signals the protesters’ defiance.  “Hong Kong is not China” and “If you want peace, prepare for war” are some of the messages.  Tse said he believes violence is necessary because the government rarely listens to peaceful protests.   “Tactically I think we should have a higher level of violence,” he said. “I actually told my wife that if we’ll ever need to form an army on the protester side I will join.” 	Reuters

Chinese customers account for more than a third of spending on luxury products worldwide, and are increasingly shopping for these in their home market rather than on overseas trips.  Dolce & Gabbana’s overall revenues in the year ended March 2019 grew 4.9% to 1.38 billion euros ($1.54 billion), more than half of which came from sales in shops and outlets, the group said in a filing to Italy’s Chamber of Commerce seen by Reuters.  But the Asia-Pacific market shrank to 22% from 25% of total turnover and the group expects sales in Greater China to decline in the current fiscal year, ending in March 2020, the filing said.   Dolce & Gabbana, which does not publicly disclose its results, was not immediately available for a comment.  Last November the group was forced to cancel a marquee show in Shanghai amid a spiraling backlash against an advertising campaign that was decried as racist by celebrities and on social media and led to Chinese e-commerce sites boycotting D&G products.  Users reacted angrily to a series of adverts showing a Chinese woman struggling to eat pizza and spaghetti with chopsticks. The blunder was compounded when screenshots were circulated online that appeared to show co-founder Stefano Gabbana making negative remarks about China, even though the designer said his account had been hacked.  Gabbana and co-founder Domenico Dolce later asked for China’s “forgiveness” in a video posted on China’s Twitter-like platform Weibo, trying to salvage a crucial market for the luxury brand.  The company’s results filing does not mention the ad controversy but refers to global trade tensions and a slowdown in China’s economy as clouding the overall outlook. Recent protests in Hong Kong have also been cited by global fashion brands as a negative factor.  The slowdown in Asia contrasted with the Americas, where sales increased to 16 percent of 2018-19 turnover from 13 percent a year earlier. Other markets remained stable, with Italy accounting for 23% of revenues, Europe 28% and Japan 5%.  Overall sales are expected to increase slightly in the current fiscal year but with costs at almost 60% of revenues, profitability is suffering.   In the last fiscal year, Ebitda - earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization - fell by more than 40% to 87.2 million euros, with a contraction in margins to 6.3% from 12.2% of sales.  However the group said things could improve in the second part of the 2019-2020 year.   “The good start of the Fall/Winter retail season could be the sign of a better than expected second half of the year,” it said.  The latest industry 2019 outlook, released by consultancy Bain in June - at the onset of the Hong Kong protests - forecast a 4% to 6% increase in global sales of luxury goods at constant currencies thanks largely to booming Chinese demand. Mainland China is expected to rise 18-20%.          	Reuters

Carrie Lam was speaking in public for the first time since demonstrations escalated on Sunday, when police fired water cannon and volleys of tear gas in running battles with protesters who threw bricks and petrol bombs.  The Chinese-ruled city is grappling with its biggest political crisis since its handover to Beijing in 1997 and Communist Party authorities have sent a clear warning that forceful intervention is possible to quell the violence.    Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed leader said she would not give up on building a platform for dialogue, although the time was not right to set up an independent inquiry into the crisis, one of the cornerstone demands of protesters.  “We should prepare for reconciliation in society by communicating with different people ... We want to put an end to the chaotic situation in Hong Kong,” Lam said, adding she did not believe her government had lost control.  More demonstrations are planned over coming days and weeks, posing a direct challenge to authorities in Beijing, who are eager to quell the unrest ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1.  Beijing warned again on Tuesday against foreign governments interfering in the Hong Kong protests, after the G7 summit of leaders of seven industrialized nations called for violence to be avoided.   Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing was “strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed” to the G7 “making thoughtless remarks and gesticulating” about Hong Kong matters.  On a visit to the southern province of Guangdong near Hong Kong, public security minister Zhao Kezhi said China would crack down on violent terrorist activities and firmly safeguard its political security.  Unrest in the Asian financial hub escalated in mid-June over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.  But the demonstrations have evolved over 12 straight weeks into a broad demand for greater democracy under the “one country, two systems” formula following the handover to China by colonial ruler Britain in 1997.  Authorities have so far refused to meet any of the protesters’ five key demands: withdraw the extradition bill, set up an independent inquiry into the protests and perceived police brutality, stop describing the protests as “rioting”, waive charges against those arrested, and resume political reform.  Since the movement started, police have arrested 883 people, including several minors, with the youngest just 12, they said on Tuesday. Those charged number 136, while 205 police officers have been injured.  On Monday, the government said illegal violence was pushing Hong Kong to the brink of great danger after weekend clashes that included the first gunshot.  The protests come as Hong Kong faces its first recession in a decade, with all its pillars of growth under significant stress. Rating agencies have raised long-term questions over the quality of its governance.  Made jittery by the unrest, some Hong Kong tycoons have  started to move personal wealth offshore while residents have begun to look for homes elsewhere.  Jamie Mi, partner at Melbourne-based Kay & Burton, said the real estate agency was receiving about one-third more enquiries from Hong Kong buyers than usual, with most targeting high-end properties priced above A$5 million ($3.4 million).   Juwai.com, China’s largest international property website, recorded a 50% increase in Hong Kong enquiries for Australian properties in the past quarter. 	Reuters

Jamie Mi, partner at Melbourne-based Kay & Burton, said the real estate agency was receiving about one-third more enquiries from Hong Kong buyers than usual, with most buyers targeting high-end properties priced above A$5 million ($3.4 million).  She said the protests in Hong Kong had “accelerated the motivation” in the past month for wealthy buyers to look for residential properties to move their money into.  The protests, triggered earlier this year by a proposed extradition bill that would allow individuals to be sent to mainland China to face trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party, have become more violent in recent weeks.    Police for the first time used a water cannon to combat  protests on Sunday, while some protesters threw petrol bombs at police.          Juwai.com, China’s largest international property website, recorded a 50% increase in Hong Kong enquiries for Australian properties in the past quarter.  “In the current environment, Australia appears as a safe harbor — both comfortably close and far from home,” Juwai.com executive chairman Georg Chmiel said in a statement to Reuters.  Buying real estate in Australia and New Zealand does not grant Hong Kong investors residency.  Several real estate agents said the buying enquiries are likely coming from wealthy foreigners who are already allowed to reside in Australia or New Zealand and who are possibly planning an exit strategy from Hong Kong.  Australia is seeing an increase in interest in its millionaires-only visa program from wealthy Hong Kong residents who are eyeing a safety net amid political turmoil in the Chinese-ruled territory.  Under the program, people can obtain a provisional visa if they invest at least A$5 million ($3.4 million) into complying investments in Australia.  New Zealand has similar investor visas that require a minimum NZ$3 million ($1.9 million) spend.    Another factor behind the spike in buying enquiries in Australia and New Zealand is the economic impact the protests are having on the Asian financial hub, which is now facing its first recession in a decade.   James Chan, from Bayleys Real Estate in New Zealand, said enquiries had been ticking up ever since the protests intensified. “They are starting to think about how to protect their money - they need to look for a safe haven,” he said.  Official figures suggest the overall level of foreign home buying in New Zealand is relatively low - about 3 percent of property transfers nationwide - however the data does not capture property bought through trusts.      Australia’s property sector has long been a favored destination for foreign buyers, especially Chinese, although demand has been tempered in recent years by rising state taxes on foreign purchases.  Australia and New Zealand have also introduced tighter regulations on foreign purchases of established homes in recent years, pushing Chinese investors toward new apartments.  Government data on foreign property investment for 2018-19 has not yet been published. The year before, Chinese investors were by far the single biggest group of foreign buyers of Australian real estate, accounting for A$12.7 billion ($8.6 billion) in purchases. Hong Kong investors spent A$2.8 billion ($1.9 billion) that year.  	Reuters

Four MTR subway stations were closed around Kwun Tong, a densely populated area of the Chinese-ruled city on the east of the Kowloon peninsula, but thousands packed the streets anyway, most carrying umbrellas against the sun.  Police used tear gas after some protesters threw Molotov cocktails and bricks and others tore up “smart” lamp posts equipped with surveillance cameras. Others had set up roadblocks with bamboo scaffolding.  It was the first use of tear gas in 10 days after a series of mostly peaceful demonstrations in the former British colony.  There were no immediate reports of injuries.  “Give me democracy or give me death,” was spray-painted on a wall, an illustration how the demands of the protesters have expanded beyond the withdrawal of a bill that would have allowed extraditions to China.  The government said in a statement the protesters “posed a serious threat to the safety of everyone” at the scene.  “After repeated warnings to the protesters..., police officers deployed tear gas and minimum force to disperse protesters,” it said.  There were sporadic, smaller protests elsewhere in the territory which continued after nightfall. Police fired tear gas in a running battle with protesters blocking a highway in the Wong Tai Sin district, to the northwest of Kwun Tong.  The airport and the roads and railways leading to it operated normally despite plans by protesters to implement a “stress test” of transport links after weeks of unrest.  The airport was forced to close last week after protesters thronged the main terminal for several days, grounding around 1,000 flights and occasionally clashing with police.  The wider calls for democracy have plunged the city into an unprecedented crisis posing a direct challenge for Communist Party leaders in Beijing.   Demonstrators say they are fighting the erosion of the “one country, two systems” arrangement that enshrines a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong since it was handed back from British to Chinese rule in 1997.  One Kwun Tong protester showed off a tattoo on her arm which read “Hong Kong add oil”, a common encouragement for the protest movement.  “I love Hong Kong very much. Even though I may not come out to protest regularly, I still want to mark down this moment,” Bu Chan, 25, told Reuters.  Hundreds took part in an “anti-fake news” protest, with people waving the Hong Kong and China flags and targeting government-funded broadcaster RTHK. A station spokeswoman, Amen Ng, rejected claims that RTHK was engaged in fake news.  British consulate staffer Simon Cheng was detained for 15 days for violating public security management regulations, police in Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong, said on their Twitter-like Weibo account.  Police said Cheng was released as scheduled on Saturday and that his legal rights and interests had been observed. They also said Cheng had confessed to accusations against him, a commonly used comment by Chinese police, even though Cheng was not given a chance to defend himself in court.  Cheng had now returned to Hong Kong, his family said on his Facebook page.  No details were given of his detention, with the Facebook post asking the “media and friends to give them some time and space, and we will explain more later”.  Some protesters in recent days had demanded Cheng be released. Britain said it welcomed the news.  Cathay Pacific Airways, which has become the biggest corporate casualty of the protests after China demanded it suspend staff involved in the demonstrations, protested against a planned rally by the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions around the airport’s “Cathay City” HQ on Monday.  “We have also reiterated to our employees that there is a zero-tolerance approach to any support for or participation in illegal protests, violent activities or overly radical behavior,” it said in a statement.  There is no sign of a let-up almost three months after the anti-government demonstrations began. On Friday night, thousands of chanting protesters formed human chains around the city in a peaceful protest dubbed the “Hong Kong Way”.  Authorities have so far refused to meet any of the protesters’ five key demands, including calls for an independent inquiry into police brutality, a full withdrawal of the extradition bill, and full democracy.  Organizers are planning a host of protests in the coming weeks including a mass march, a city-wide strike and class boycotts at universities. 	Reuters

In Hong Kong, a weekend flare-up in violence during anti-government protests added to pressure on share prices.  The onshore yuan fell 0.6% in early trade to 7.15 per dollar, its weakest since February 2008 and its second biggest one-day drop of the month. The offshore yuan fell to a record low of 7.1850, before regaining some ground to around 7.1595.  The Chinese authorities have allowed the tightly-managed yuan to fall some 3.6% so far this month as trade tensions between Beijing and Washington worsened, sparking fears of a global currency war. It was trading around 7.1419 by 0330 GMT.  On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced an additional duty on some $550 billion of targeted Chinese goods, hours after China unveiled retaliatory tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S. goods.  “This tit-for-tat escalation shows how unlikely a trade deal and de-escalation have become,” Louis Kuijs, of Oxford Economics, wrote in a note late on Sunday.  “The impact of the new tariffs on China’s economic growth will be sizeable,” he said.  Oxford now expects China’s economic growth could fall significantly below 6% next year, even assuming more policy support measures.  The benchmark CSI300 Index sank 1.2% by the midday break, while the Shanghai Composite Index fell about 1%. Chinese 10-year Treasury futures rallied 0.3% in early trade on Monday.  China’s central bank had been seen trying to stabilise the yuan in recent weeks after allowing a sudden slide in its value in early August following new U.S. tariff threats. On Friday, traders thought it was signalling a floor at the 7.1 level.  But Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong, expects further weakness in the yuan for the rest of this year following the latest dramatic escalation.  “The PBOC has not yet signaled its bottom line for the yuan,” Cheung said, referring to the People’s Bank of China, the central bank.  “And given the United States is holding its presidential election next year, the situation is unlikely to deteriorate too much as that could trigger a backfire.”  In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3% in morning trade as investor confidence continued to weaken amid the deteriorating trade outlook and the latest flare-up in violent anti-government protests in the city.  It was trading down 2.7% at 0333 GMT.  “The sentiment towards local companies is really bad. People have been pessimistic on the rental and tourism outlook and what happened over the weekend doesn’t help,” said Alex Wong, director at Ample Finance Group in Hong Kong.  Protests on Sunday saw some of the fiercest clashes yet between police and demonstrators since violence escalated in mid-June over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong people to be sent to mainland China for trial.  With the economic outlook souring rapidly, analysts expect more growth measures from Beijing in coming weeks and months.  On Monday, the Chinese central bank injected 150 billion yuan worth of funds into the financial system via its medium-term lending facility, or MLF. It kept the interest rate on the instrument unchanged at 3.3%.  Markets had expected the PBOC to keep key rates steady this week, but a cut is expected by mid-September after a policy review by the U.S. Federal Reserve, as Beijing steps up efforts to lower borrowing costs to support growth.

Demonstrators, families young and old, some people masked, some using hand wipes to stay clean, linked hands across different districts as others held up banners thanking overseas nations for supporting “freedom and democracy” in Hong Kong.  Their move echoed one on Aug. 23, 1989, when an estimated 2 million people joined arms across the three Baltic states in a protest against Soviet rule that became known as the “Baltic Way” or “Baltic Chain”.  “I joined the Hong Kong Way because it’s peaceful,” said protester Peter Cheung, 27. “This is the 30th anniversary of the Baltic Way. I hope there will be a bigger chance to make an international noise.”  The protest, which included dozens shining lights from the top of Kowloon’s Lion Rock, visible from the main island of Hong Kong, showed the apparent defiance of Hong Kong people after warnings from Communist Party leaders in Beijing and Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam about violence.  Police presence was thin and the protest ended promptly at 9 p.m. (1300 GMT).   But protesters are also planning a “stress test” of the airport this weekend and some, wearing their traditional black garb, were making their way from the nearby suburban town of Tung Chung on Friday night.  The protests, triggered by a now-suspended bill that would have allowed extraditions to China, have plunged the former British colony into its worst crisis since its return to China in 1997 and pose a major challenge for Beijing.  The unrest has widened into calls for greater freedom, fueled by worries about the erosion of rights guaranteed under a “one country, two systems” formula, adopted after the 1997 handover, such as an independent judiciary and the right to protest.  The airport, reached by a gleaming suspension bridge carrying both rail and road traffic, was forced to close last week when protesters, barricading passageways with luggage trolleys, metal barriers and other objects, clashed with police.  China’s Hong Kong affairs office condemned the mayhem as “near-terrorist acts”.  “Go to the airport by different means, including MTR, airport bus, taxi, bike and private car to increase pressure on airport transport,” protest organizers wrote online on Friday.  The Airport Authority published a half-page notice in newspapers urging young people to “love Hong Kong” and said it opposed acts that blocked the airport, adding that it would keep working to maintain smooth operations.  Hong Kong’s high court extended an order restricting protests at the airport. Some activists had apologized for last week’s airport turmoil.  The Canadian consulate said it had suspended travel to mainland China for local staff, just days after a Chinese employee of the city’s British consulate was confirmed to have been detained in China.  Beijing has said that Simon Cheng, the consulate employee, was detained in the border city of Shenzhen neighboring Hong Kong. It has accused Britain and other Western countries of meddling in its affairs in Hong Kong.   Canada’s latest travel advisory on Thursday warned of reports of increased screening of travelers’ digital devices at border crossings between mainland China and Hong Kong.  Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Canada’s decision not to allow local staff to visit the mainland was one for Canada, which it respected. If people came to China and followed the law, they would have no problems, he told a daily news briefing.  “But if you have a hidden aim, and are hatching a sinister plot, then I fear in China you need to be in a state of apprehension and extra careful.”  The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China said it had received multiple reports of Chinese border officials detaining journalists and searching their digital devices when traveling between the mainland and Hong Kong.   The protests are taking a toll on Hong Kong’s economy and tourism, with the special administrative region on the cusp of its first recession in a decade.  Transport Secretary Frank Chan said airport passenger volume from Aug. 1 to Aug. 21 was down 11% from the same period last year, with cargo volume down 14%.  Commerce Secretary Edward Yau said visitor arrivals started to fall in mid-July. For Aug. 15 to Aug. 20, arrivals were down 49.6% on the corresponding 2018 period.  “It was the fastest and steepest drop in recent years, and the situation is obviously very worrisome,” he told reporters.  The protests have caused corporate casualties, most dramatically at the Cathay Pacific (0293.HK) airline, amid mounting Chinese scrutiny of the involvement of some of its staff in protests.  Cathay confirmed on Friday that Rebecca Sy, the head of Cathay Dragon’s Airlines Flight Attendants’ Association, was no longer with the company. Her departure follows the shock resignation of Cathay Chief Executive Rupert Hogg last week.  Demonstrators have five demands: withdraw the extradition bill, set up an independent inquiry into the protests and perceived police brutality, stop describing the protests as “rioting”, waive charges against those arrested, and resume political reform.     Beijing has sent a clear warning that forceful intervention is possible, with paramilitary forces holding drills just over the border. 	Reuters

Back on Aug. 23, 1989, he was one of an estimated 2 million people who joined arms across the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in a protest against Soviet rule that became known as the “Baltic Way”.  Thirty years later, on Friday, he was back again with around 12,000 others to form a symbolic chain in Vilnius to remember the protest that paved the way to their liberation from the Soviet Union.  In a nod to the protesters who came after them on the other side of the world, some in the Lithuanian crowd carried Hong Kong and Tibetan flags.  “The Baltic Way was occupied people showing their oppressor that they are no longer afraid and that they will be free,” Terleckas, now 50, told Reuters. “I think this is what inspires Hong Kong to fight for their rights and freedom in this way.”  Lithuania’s President Gitanas Nauseda, who was marking the anniversary with his Latvian counterpart at another event on their shared border, added: “The welfare, peace and prosperity of Hong Kong’s people is a goal we all share.”  Demonstrators in Hong Kong - whose protests were triggered by a now-suspended bill that would have allowed extraditions to China - acknowledged their debt to the Baltics.  “The Baltic Way was an inspirational event to many freedom-fighters around the world,” Joshua Wong, one of Hong Kong’s democracy leaders, said in an email.   “This is the 30th anniversary of the Baltic Way. I hope there will be a bigger chance to make an international noise,” protester Peter Cheung, 27, said at the scene.

The protests, triggered by a now-suspended bill that would have allowed extraditions to China, have plunged the former British colony into its worst crisis since its return to China in 1997 and pose a major challenge for Beijing.  The unrest has widened into calls for greater freedom, fueled by worries about the erosion of rights guaranteed under a “one country, two systems” formula, adopted after the 1997 handover, such as an independent judiciary and the right to protest.  The airport, reached by a gleaming suspension bridge carrying both rail and road traffic, was forced to close last week when protesters, barricading passageways with luggage trolleys, metal barriers and other objects, clashed with police.  China’s Hong Kong affairs office condemned the mayhem as “near-terrorist acts”.  “Go to the airport by different means, including MTR, airport bus, taxi, bike and private car to increase pressure on airport transport,” protest organizers wrote online on Friday.  The Airport Authority published a half-page notice in newspapers urging young people to “love Hong Kong” and said it opposed acts that blocked the airport, adding that it would keep working to maintain smooth operations.  Hong Kong’s high court extended an order restricting protests at the airport. Some activists had apologized for last week’s airport turmoil.  The Canadian consulate said it had suspended travel to mainland China for local staff, just days after a Chinese employee of the city’s British consulate was confirmed to have been detained in China.  Beijing has said that Simon Cheng, the consulate employee, was detained in the border city of Shenzhen neighboring Hong Kong. It has accused Britain and other Western countries of meddling in its affairs in Hong Kong.   Canada’s latest travel advisory on Thursday warned of reports of increased screening of travelers’ digital devices at border crossings between mainland China and Hong Kong.  Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Canada’s decision not to allow local staff to visit the mainland was one for Canada, which it respected. If people came to China and followed the law, they would have no problems, he told a daily news briefing.  “But if you have a hidden aim, and are hatching a sinister plot, then I fear in China you need to be in a state of apprehension and extra careful.”  The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China said it had received multiple reports of Chinese border officials detaining journalists and searching their digital devices when traveling between the mainland and Hong Kong.   The protests are taking a toll on Hong Kong’s economy and tourism, with the special administrative region on the cusp of its first recession in a decade.  Transport Secretary Frank Chan said airport passenger volume from Aug. 1 to Aug. 21 was down 11% from the same period last year, with cargo volume down 14%.  Commerce Secretary Edward Yau said visitor arrivals started to fall in mid-July. For Aug. 15 to Aug. 20, arrivals were down 49.6% on the corresponding 2018 period.  “It was the fastest and steepest drop in recent years, and the situation is obviously very worrisome,” he told reporters.  The protests have caused corporate casualties, most dramatically at the Cathay Pacific (0293.HK) airline, amid mounting Chinese scrutiny of the involvement of some of its staff in protests.  Cathay confirmed on Friday that Rebecca Sy, the head of Cathay Dragon’s Airlines Flight Attendants’ Association, was no longer with the company. Her departure follows the shock resignation of Cathay Chief Executive Rupert Hogg last week.  Demonstrators have five demands: withdraw the extradition bill, set up an independent inquiry into the protests and perceived police brutality, stop describing the protests as “rioting”, waive charges against those arrested, and resume political reform.     Beijing has sent a clear warning that forceful intervention is possible, with paramilitary forces holding drills just over the border. 	Reuters

538	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1VD0S6	August 23, 2019 /  8:52 AM / 7 months ago	Explainer: Hong Kong's 'borrowed time' - worry about 2047 hangs over protests	HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong’s protest movement began as opposition to a now-suspended extradition bill but evolved into a direct challenge to the city’s government and calls for full democracy.  Beyond their immediate demands, many young protesters, express fears for the future - anxiety that reflects broader uncertainty over China’s promise to Britain to maintain the freewheeling city’s way of life for 50 years.   That 50-year period runs out in 2047.  The fears are twofold. Firstly, many Hong Kong people have watched what they see as Beijing’s tightening grip on their city, from the detention of booksellers by mainland security agents to the expulsion of a foreign journalist, the jailing of young activists, sweeping legal interpretations by Beijing on city matters, and curbs on electoral freedom.  Many say the extradition bill - which would have put Hong Kong people at the mercy of China’s Communist Party-controlled courts - was merely the latest in a string of erosions.  But their fears also reflect uncertainty over Hong Kong’s future that is written into the Basic Law, the mini-constitution that has guided Hong Kong’s relations with Beijing since the handover from British rule in 1997.   The document enshrines rights and freedoms - including freedom of speech, assembly and an independent judiciary - inherent in the “one country, two systems” formula that underpinned agreement between Beijing and London.  Those freedoms remain far greater than those that exist on the mainland, where the Communist Party ultimately controls many aspects of society, including the media and the courts.   Article 5 of the Basic Law states that China’s “socialist system and policies” shall not be practised in Hong Kong and “the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years”.  Just as British colonial Hong Kong was famously described by the Eurasian writer Han Suyin as existing on “borrowed time in a borrowed place”, the clock to 2047 is ticking.  No one knows. Talking to officials, scholars, business people and protesters, there is uncertainty about the broad principles and the impact on specifics, such as property leases and the judiciary.  Some believe much will depend on how Beijing views the city at the time, and what political changes unfold across China over the next 28 years.  “Of course, it’s vague but it is clear that after 50 years mainland policy can change. They don’t have to change but they can change,” said Simon Young, a professor at the University of Hong Kong Law School.   “They would no longer be beholden by Article 5 and the Joint Declaration,” he said, referring to another agreement with Britain.  The city’s government has said little on Hong Kong after 2047. Its constitutional affairs bureau said in 2016 the Basic Law had no expiry date.   “The country’s sovereignty over Hong Kong will not change 50 years after Hong Kong’s return to the Motherland, nor will the country change its basic policies towards Hong Kong after 50 years,” then bureau undersecretary Ronald Chan said at the time.  A bureau spokeswoman affirmed that reply to Reuters this week. “There is no question of the expiry of the Basic Law in 2047 as the PRC (People’s Republic of China) will not change its basic policies to Hong Kong, i.e. one country, two systems.”  Despite the protests, Ip Kwok-him, a veteran pro-establishment politician who sits on Hong Kong’s Executive Council, its top policy advisory body, said he believed Beijing still wanted to extend the formula beyond 2047.  “In my interactions with China’s leaders, I could sense this position,” said Ip, who is also a delegate to China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress.   The central government’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office did not respond to questions from Reuters on the issue.  Many in Hong Kong remain far more skeptical, fearing that Hong Kong will be absorbed into China’s system and its freedoms, already under threat, will evaporate.   As protests enter their 12th week, it is clear the question of 2047 is becoming more pertinent. Young protesters’ increasing focus on issues like democratic reform - promised in the Basic Law - highlights a desire to protect Hong Kong’s freedoms in the years ahead.   As thousands of activists shut down Hong Kong’s airport last week, a sign hung above them in the arrivals’ hall: “Let the future be created”.

The Canadian Consulate in Hong Kong said on Friday it has suspended travel to mainland China for local staff, just days after an employee of the city’s British Consulate was confirmed to have been detained in China.  China’s foreign ministry confirmed on Wednesday that Simon Cheng, an employee of the British mission, had been detained in the border city of Shenzhen neighbouring Hong Kong.  Beijing has accused Britain and other Western countries of meddling in its affairs in Hong Kong.  Canada’s latest travel advisory on Thursday warned that increased screening of travellers’ digital devices had been reported at border crossings between mainland China and Hong Kong.  Multiple protests are planned for Hong Kong on Friday, including a march by accountants to government headquarters and a “Baltic Chain” event where protesters will join hands across different districts in the Chinese territory.  In 1989, an estimated two million people joined arms across three Baltic states in a protest against Soviet rule that became known as the Baltic Way or Baltic Chain.  “The Baltic Way brought the world’s attention to their cause and inspired following generations,” the rally organisers said in a statement. “We plead that you will not look away at this crucial time. Stand with Hong Kong.”  The protests, originally over a now-suspended extradition bill to mainland China, have plunged Hong Kong into its deepest crisis since its British handover to Beijing in 1997 and pose a major challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping.  Alphabet Inc’s Google announced on Thursday its YouTube streaming video service had disabled 210 channels appearing to engage in a coordinated influence operation around the Hong Kong protests. Twitter and Facebook have also dismantled a similar campaign originating in mainland China.  The unrest has widened into calls for greater freedom, fuelled by worries about the erosion of rights guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula, adopted after the 1997 handover, such as an independent judiciary and the right to protest.  Activists plan to disrupt transport to Hong Kong’s international airport at the weekend.  “Go to the airport by different means, including MTR, Airport Bus, Taxi, Bike and Private Car to increase pressure on airport transport,” protest organisers wrote online.  Hong Kong’s airport, one of the world’s busiest, was forced to close temporarily last week and hundreds of flights were cancelled or rescheduled when protesters and police clashed.  The Airport Authority published a half-page advertisement in major newspapers on Friday urging young people to “love Hong Kong” and said it opposed acts that “blocked and interfered with the operation of the airport”. It said it would continue to work to maintain smooth operations.  Hong Kong’s High Court on Friday extended an order restricting protesters at the city’s international airport.  The order requires public demonstrations have the permission of authorities and is aimed at banning “those who want to deliberately obstruct or interefere with the normal use of the airport”, said the court.  Nearly three months of anti-government rallies have plunged the city into crisis, drawing in corporate casualties such as Cathay Pacific amid mounting Chinese scrutiny over the involvement of some of the carrier’s staff in protests.  Cathay confirmed on Friday that Rebecca Sy, the head of Cathay Dragon’s Airlines Flight Attendants’ Association, was no longer with the company. Her departure follows the shock resignation of Cathay CEO Rupert Hogg last week.  The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions said it will hold a news conference later on Friday to provide details of Sy’s departure.  The protests are already taking a toll on the city’s economy and tourism, with the special administrative region on the cusp of its first recession in a decade.  Corporations, including big banks and property developers, have called for a restoration of law and order, while exhibitors are seeing widespread cancellations of events.  In the most recent case, international jewellers have sought the rescheduling of a huge trade fair with up to 40% of exhibitors threatening to pull out.  Demonstrators have five demands: withdraw the extradition bill, establish an independent inquiry into the protests and perceived police brutality, stop describing the protests as “rioting”, waive charges against those arrested, and resume political reform.

Recently, the 17-year-old also started describing herself as a patriot who supports China’s stance on Hong Kong.  The high school student from Shanghai is among the Chinese citizens who in recent weeks have flocked to Western social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter to criticise demonstrators in the former British colony.  She is part of a growing offensive emerging from China in recent days aimed at promoting Beijing’s narrative about what is happening in Hong Kong to an overseas audience. State media outlets, Chinese celebrities and regular internet users have all banded together behind the effort.  While little news or video footage of the Hong Kong protests made its way into mainland China in the early weeks, the subject now dominates the news and most-read topic lists on China’s Twitter-like Weibo, with calls for Chinese citizens to take action to “protect Hong Kong”.  China’s government-owned media outlets have flooded Internet platforms both inside and outside the country with stories and images portraying the Hong Kong protests as the work of “terrorists” manipulated by Western powers and “radical forces”.  They have paid to promote their coverage of Hong Kong on sites including Twitter and Facebook, which are banned on the mainland. The companies said Tuesday that the Chinese government has also mounted a propaganda campaign using fake accounts, thousands of which were taken down in recent days.  The efforts have unleashed an unusual dynamic in which mainland citizens who are normally subject to strict controls on their online behaviour have been using virtual private networks to bypass the “Great Firewall” and spread anti-protest messages internationally, as well as on Chinese social media sites.  “It’s only really the hypernationalists that are given free rein, their content isn’t censored,” said Fergus Ryan, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) who studies Chinese social media.  “They’re allowed to conduct campaigns, they’re able to organise online ... so that happens in China within the Great Firewall, and then we see also it spill out into the wider Internet,” he said.  But analysts say it’s unclear who Beijing is targeting with the campaign, or what the impact has been.  Lee Foster, an intelligence analyst at U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye, said the fake account campaigns on Twitter and Facebook were “relatively unsophisticated”.  “(It’s) not too dissimilar we’ve seen from Russia about 4-5 years ago in terms of very simplistic personas and the use of identical messaging across accounts,” he said.  King-wa Fu, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong’s Journalism and Media Centre, said he suspected the impact within Hong Kong was minimal.  “The majority of Hong Kong consume local media content,” he said.  The Hong Kong demonstrations began almost three months ago as a protest against a new extradition law and have since snowballed into a broader movement to defend the city-state’s civil liberties in the face of what is perceived to be tightening mainland control.  Wang said she and her group of online peers, also known as ‘fan girls’ or ‘fanquan girls’, began to campaign against the protests after her idol Zhang, a member of South Korean boy band Exo, joined other Chinese celebrities last week to say that he backed the Hong Kong police and Beijing’s territorial sovereignty.  “Since our big brother loves our country so much, we fans have to support him,” she told Reuters. “So I went on Instagram to post messages such as ‘Hong Kong is part of China,’ ‘Reject violence,’ and ‘Hong Kong police are the best!’”  They were joined by other internet denizens such as those on ‘Di Bar,’ a discussion forum that is part of search engine giant Baidu’s platform, where calls went out to the group’s 31.3 million members asking them to flood overseas social media platforms with similar slogans and posts.  The internet movements were endorsed by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV on Sunday on its nightly news programme, one of China’s most-watched shows.  “These days, from fanquan girls to Di Bar, netizens to overseas students, all the forces which love Hong Kong and China have united to support and safeguard the city,’ said newscaster Gang Qiang.  State television’s English-language channel CGTN, the official Xinhua news agency and the Communist Party’s People’s Daily have all taken to Twitter and Facebook with gusto, denouncing the protesters and putting out Beijing’s voice.  “What must be hidden and has to flee is not good, but evil,” CGTN said in a tweet on Wednesday that was accompanied by a video of masked protesters with captions saying they wanted to hide their identities to avoid retribution.  Xinhua and CGTN paid to promote their Hong Kong coverage, according to Twitter’s Ads Transparency Center. Neither outlet responded to requests for comment.  Twitter told Reuters on Monday it would no longer accept advertising from state-controlled news media.  China denounced the moves by Twitter and Facebook on Tuesday, saying it had a right to put out its own views.  China’s foreign ministry on Tuesday also sent a letter accompanied by a 42-page document to foreign media outlets including Reuters, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal outlining Beijing’s stance on the events in Hong Kong.

Wang said she and her group of online peers, also known as ‘fan girls’ or ‘fanquan girls’, began to campaign against the protests after her idol Zhang, a member of South Korean boy band Exo, joined other Chinese celebrities last week to say that he backed the Hong Kong police and Beijing’s territorial sovereignty.  “Since our big brother loves our country so much, we fans have to support him,” she told Reuters. “So I went on Instagram to post messages such as ‘Hong Kong is part of China,’ ‘Reject violence,’ and ‘Hong Kong police are the best!’”  They were joined by other internet denizens such as those on ‘Di Bar,’ a discussion forum that is part of search engine giant Baidu’s platform, where calls went out to the group’s 31.3 million members asking them to flood overseas social media platforms with similar slogans and posts.       The internet movements were endorsed by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV on Sunday on its nightly news program, one of China’s most-watched shows.  “These days, from fanquan girls to Di Bar, netizens to overseas students, all the forces which love Hong Kong and Chinahave united to support and safeguard the city,’ said newscaster Gang Qiang.        State television’s English-language channel CGTN, the official Xinhua news agency and the Communist Party’s People’s Daily have all taken to Twitter and Facebook with gusto, denouncing the protesters and putting out Beijing’s voice.      “What must be hidden and has to flee is not good, but evil,” CGTN said in a tweet on Wednesday that was accompanied by a video of masked protesters with captions saying they wanted to hide their identities to avoid retribution.      Xinhua and CGTN paid to promote their Hong Kong coverage, according to Twitter’s Ads Transparency Center. Neither outlet responded to requests for comment.        Twitter told Reuters on Monday it would no longer accept advertising from state-controlled news media.      China denounced the moves by Twitter and Facebook on Tuesday, saying it had a right to put out its own views.      China’s foreign ministry on Tuesday also sent a letter accompanied by a 42-page document to foreign media outlets including Reuters, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal outlining Beijing’s stance on the events in Hong Kong.       The documents included a timeline of how the protests began, saying that Hong Kong’s opposition and some “radical forces” had used the pretext of peaceful demonstration to engage in violent protests, as well as articles which it said pointed to links between “foreign forces” and protesters.

Recently, the 17-year-old also started describing herself as a patriot who supports China’s stance on Hong Kong.  The high school student from Shanghai is among the Chinese citizens who in recent weeks have flocked to Western social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter to criticize demonstrators in the former British colony.  She is part of a growing offensive emerging from China in recent days aimed at promoting Beijing’s narrative about what is happening in Hong Kong to an overseas audience. State media outlets, Chinese celebrities and regular internet users have all banded together behind the effort.  While little news or video footage of the Hong Kong protests made its way into mainland China in the early weeks, the subject now dominates the news and most-read topic lists on China’s Twitter-like Weibo, with calls for Chinese citizens to take action to “protect Hong Kong”.   China’s government-owned media outlets have flooded Internet platforms both inside and outside the country with stories and images portraying the Hong Kong protests as the work of “terrorists” manipulated by Western powers and “radical forces”.  They have paid to promote their coverage of Hong Kong on sites including Twitter and Facebook, which are banned on the mainland. The companies said Tuesday that the Chinese government has also mounted a propaganda campaign using fake accounts, thousands of which were taken down in recent days.  The efforts have unleashed an unusual dynamic in which mainland citizens who are normally subject to strict controls on their online behavior have been using virtual private networks to bypass the “Great Firewall” and spread anti-protest messages internationally, as well as on Chinese social media sites.   “It’s only really the hypernationalists that are given free rein, their content isn’t censored,” said Fergus Ryan, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) who studies Chinese social media.      “They’re allowed to conduct campaigns, they’re able to organize online ... so that happens in China within the Great Firewall, and then we see also it spill out into the wider Internet,” he said.  But analysts say it’s unclear who Beijing is targeting with the campaign, or what the impact has been.  Lee Foster, an intelligence analyst at U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye, said the fake account campaigns on Twitter and Facebook were “relatively unsophisticated”.      “(It’s) not too dissimilar we’ve seen from Russia about 4-5 years ago in terms of very simplistic personas and the use of identical messaging across accounts,” he said.  King-wa Fu, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong’s Journalism and Media Centre, said he suspected the impact within Hong Kong was minimal.  “The majority of Hong Kong consume local media content,” he said.

546	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1VB2LV	August 21, 2019 /  11:06 PM / in 7 months	Frontline protesters make case for violence in Hong Kong protests	HONG KONG (Reuters) - Pun sees himself as a peaceful, middle-class Hong Kong student. Yet since the beginning of June, he has been building barricades and throwing bricks at police, risking his own liberty to fight, as he sees it, for the city’s freedoms.  In one of the world’s safest cities, the idea of violence as a legitimate form of political expression - hand-in-hand with peaceful protest - is becoming increasingly mainstream in the evolving tactics of a decentralized pro-democracy movement that has disrupted Chinese-ruled Hong Kong for 11 weeks.  “I know violence cannot fight violence, but sometimes aggression is needed to attract the attention of the government and others,” 22-year-old Pun said last week, speaking at the city’s airport after overnight clashes with police.   “I have thrown rocks, I have acted as a shield with umbrellas for others, I have been helping to build barricades, to bring supplies, to take injured people to a safe zone. I have also been hit by police with batons. We’re all slowly getting used to this. We have to.”  Protests in the former British colony erupted in early June over a now-suspended bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial.  But the unrest has been fueled by broader worries about  what many say has been an erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula put in place when Hong Kong returned to China in 1997.  Unlike the Umbrella movement in 2014, when a largely peaceful 79-day occupation of Hong Kong’s financial area failed to achieve its aim of universal suffrage, a more confrontational stance from some of the protesters was evident from the start.  They came equipped with helmets, masks and goggles, and well-studied plans for supplying the protest frontlines with gear and mitigating the effects of tear gas.  And it seemed to yield some results. Within days, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, while not formally withdrawing the extradition bill, as protesters demanded, suspended the measure and declared it “dead”, a word she repeated on Tuesday.  Emboldened, the protest movement has since morphed into a broader, increasingly creative and sophisticated push for greater democracy, posing the biggest political challenge yet for Chinese President Xi Jinping.  Protesters escalated their aggressiveness, playing cat-and-mouse with the police all over the territory. While a giant march on Sunday was peaceful, activists have not ruled out further violence.  “We learned a lot from our mistakes in the Umbrella revolution,” said Pun, wearing a new set of clothes after ditching in an airport washroom the all-black protest attire he had worn the night before.  “Definitely more people accept there will be some violence now. They may not like it, they may not want to be a part of it, but they don’t condemn us. We are joined together as a force.”  There is also discipline in the mayhem.  Passers-by are often offered helmets and masks and shielded with umbrellas until they reach a safe place. Ambulances and fire trucks are accommodated. Apart from a few isolated incidents, private property has been spared.  During one protest in the Wan Chai nightlife district, couples with children casually crossed barricaded roads filled with protesters. Drinkers finished their pints and cigarettes outside even as tear gas lingered in the air. Filipino domestic helpers had a picnic on an overpass.   “The protests here are quite cute compared with Berlin or Paris,” Robert, a 40-year-old French air traffic controller, said over a beer.   Maintaining some courtesy and safety ensures the radical faction of the movement retains the support of peaceful protesters.   Researchers say one of the factors contributing to “Umbrella’s” demise was the acrimony among protest leaders between old-guard legislators advocating a peaceful, long-term plan of building public pressure and the more confrontational faction led by students such as young, bespectacled Joshua Wong.  This time, a decentralized protest movement has allowed each faction to follow their own strategy.  Last Sunday, dozens of non-frontline protesters interviewed by Reuters said they “accepted,” “supported”, or “disagreed with” the violence. But almost all said they would not condemn the violent protesters.  “Everyone has their own way of doing things, it’s result-oriented. I accept it,” said Galen Ho, 38, who was marching with his wife and 7-year-old son. Ho, who works in retail, said he leaves demonstrations before they turn violent.  A study by researchers from several Hong Kong universities conducted through 12 on-site surveys during protests from June 9 to Aug. 4, found that: “most of the participants agreed that ‘the maximum impact could only be achieved when peaceful assembly and confrontational actions work together’.”  It also found the extent to which protesters agreed or strongly agreed with the saying “the use of violence by protesters is understandable when the government fails to listen” increased from 69% to more than 90% over the summer.  Only around 1% disagreed or strongly disagreed, down from 12.5% in June.  “We’re not the goodie-goodie Hong Kongers anymore,” said 23-year-old Iris, after helping tie up metal railings with plastic straps to build barricades in a brief protest in the Tai Wai working class neighborhood.  “It’s the government who pushed us to this path. We didn’t want to. Who doesn’t want to live stably, have three meals and stay home peacefully and just earn an income?”   But it works both ways.   On Sunday, when a group of protesters shouted expletives near a police station, one man reminded them the demonstration - which drew 1.7 million according to organizers - had to remain peaceful on the day. They backed off swiftly.  “It’s our way of showing support to the peaceful ones in return for the support they’ve been showing us,” said Victor, 26, wearing a black mask covering all but his eyes, a black helmet, knee pads and arm guards.   On Tuesday, chief executive Lam moved another inch, saying a task force will look into complaints about police behavior during the protests, though failing to address a core demand of the protesters for an independent inquiry.  Amanda Tattersall, a researcher at the University of Sydney, who has been studying Hong Kong protests for three years, said the movement’s peaceful majority and the confrontational group have been “co-dependent” from the beginning of the summer.  That ensured violence is used for tactical purposes, rather than to simply create chaos.  “The movement is pretty disciplined about the extent to which it engages in, and the boundaries it sets for, quote-unquote, violence,” Tattersall said.

Some masked protesters clashed with police, spraying fire extinguishers from the inside of Yuen Long station as others smeared the floor with cooking oil, beer and detergent to stop the police advancing.  Some blocked station exits with bins, booths and other station furniture as others sealed roads outside the station, aiming green laser beams at the lines of shield-bearing officers. Others threw empty fire extinguishers at police lines.  Many inside the station sat quietly.  It was the latest in a series of demonstrations since June against a perceived erosion of freedoms in the former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  It also marked a return to aggression after a brief lull in tensions following a huge peaceful march on Sunday.  But the standoff stopped short of full pitched battles with police refraining from using tear gas or attempting to storm protester lines. Only one rock was seen hitting a police shield and most protesters were headed home before midnight.  The protest marked the night of July 21, when more than 100 white-shirted men stormed the Yuen Long station hours after protesters had marched through central Hong Kong and defaced China’s Liaison Office - the main symbol of Beijing’s authority.  Using pipes and clubs, the men attacked black-clad protesters returning from Hong Kong island as well as passers-by and journalists, wounding 45 people.  Democratic Party legislator Lam Cheuk-ting, wounded in the attack by suspected triad gangsters, said he believed the protesters wanted a peaceful night on Wednesday but he could not rule out further violence - from gangsters or the police.  “It is impossible to predict... It is deeply disappointing that all these weeks later we still don’t have an independent inquiry into those events,” he told Reuters.  Squads of police were stationed on the station perimeter and some protesters jeered and shone lasers at them. A small crowd of masked young men gathered on a station balcony, swearing and cursing at police vans down a side street.  Anger erupted in June over a now-suspended bill that would allow criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China for trial. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said again on Tuesday the legislation was dead.  The unrest has been fueled by broader worries about the erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula adopted after Hong Kong’s return to China, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest. Demonstrations have included the storming of the legislature and havoc at the airport.  Beijing has reacted sharply to the protests and has accused  foreign countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest. China has also sent clear warning that forceful intervention is possible, with paramilitary forces holding drills in neighboring Shenzhen.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reiterated Washington’s calls for China to honor its commitment to “one country, two systems”.  Speaking to CBS program “This Morning” on Tuesday, Pompeo highlighted remarks by President Donald Trump at the weekend warning against a crackdown like Beijing’s suppression of pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989.  Trump said this would make reaching a deal he has been seeking to end a trade war with China “very hard”.  In an editorial on Tuesday, China’s influential state-run tabloid, the Global Times, called Monday’s comments by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence linking the trade talks to the Hong Kong protests “outrageous”.

550	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N25H09K	August 21, 2019 /  6:41 AM / 7 months ago	Don't 'mess up Macau': gambling hub set to choose Beijing-backed leader	HONG KONG (Reuters) - The Chinese territory of Macau is set to elect as leader the only candidate for which it is allowed to vote: a Beijing-backed former legislator who is expected to cement China’s control over the special administrative region and distance it from escalating protests in neighboring Hong Kong.  The selection of former legislature head Ho Iat Seng - the sole candidate approved to run - is scheduled for Sunday, when he will be chosen by a 400-member pro-Beijing committee to lead the world’s largest gambling hub for at least the next five years.   The 62-year-old’s highly scripted appointment comes as the former Portuguese colony tries to position itself as a beacon of stability and model for the Chinese government’s “one country, two systems” formula through which Beijing administers Macau and Hong Kong.  “Many people expressed they do not want to mess up Macau,” Ho told local media this week, explaining that he had heard much opposition to the protests that have plunged Hong Kong into its deepest political crisis since its handover to Beijing in 1997.   Ho, who has deep ties to China and was on the committee of the mainland’s prestigious legislative body, said local youth could resist the influence of Hong Kong’s protesters and supported measures to boost patriotism in Macau.   Although anti-government protests have roiled the former British colony of Hong Kong for nearly three months, Macau has seen little dissent to Beijing’s rule.  Many in Macau, particularly the middle-aged and elderly, have sought to distance themselves from the movement.  “People in Macau are more satisfied. Everyone is secure with their jobs. We have annual payments. We are comfortable and we are grateful for it,” said Ms Leong, a marketing executive who declined to give her first name.  Chinese rule has generally been welcomed in Macau, which has seen economic growth soar and a sustained period of stability - a sharp contrast to the years preceding the handover in 1999, when there were a series of mob wars.   About half of Macau’s population of 600,000 immigrated from China in recent decades, which has helped foster a stronger affinity for the mainland than in Hong Kong, where most of the population was born in the territory.   In recent years, millions of dollars have been piled into creating youth associations linked to the Chinese government that encourage study and learning in the mainland.   Macau’s behavior has pleased Beijing. In state media this week, netizens applauded the swift shutdown of a planned unlawful protest against what activists described as excessive violence by Hong Kong’s police.   Police told Reuters that dozens of officers were deployed on Monday to the historic Senado Square, where the protest was meant to take place, and that 30 people were “investigated”.  The ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily said on its online Weibo account “why are Macau people so excellent#? It comes to the importance of education.” Other comments praised Macau’s police enforcement and local mindset.  “Positive life is meaningful,” wrote another user. “Macau doesn’t want to respond to Hong Kong.  Don’t prevent Macau people from making money, you are not welcome to revolt here.”   Ho, who campaigned on integrating Macau’s economy with the Greater Bay Area and improving livelihoods, will take over from incumbent Fernando Chui in December as Macau celebrates 20 years under Chinese rule and President Xi Jinping is slated to visit.  The Communist Party will also mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic on Oct 1.   Macau-born Ho moved into government in the early 2000s after starting off in the family business under his industrial tycoon father, Ho Tin.  He has no ties to the casino industry, in contrast to previous leaders, and will play a key role in determining what will happen to the six casino operators - Sands China, Wynn Macau, SJM Holdings, Galaxy Entertainment, Melco Resorts and MGM China - when their licenses expire in coming years.   Ho has said he wants “healthy” development for the gambling industry, as it is the main source of tax revenue for the government. He has also warned that the protests and the China-U.S. trade war could hurt Macau’s economy.   As Hong Kong’s protests have intensified, Ho has cautioned against rushing through controversial legislation such as national education and a public investment vehicle, and stated that the government needs to be more inclusive.   But Macau pro-democratic activists, mainly in their 20s and 30s, say the city has a broken and undemocratic political system and called on the international community to support Macau’s efforts for democratization.  An open letter from a group of anonymous locals on Wednesday demanded universal suffrage and said Beijing had been imposing stronger control with increasingly authoritarian rule.  “The time to fight for our universal rights is now, before Macau becomes just another Chinese city,” the letter said. “The eyes of the world are on Hong Kong right now. But please also take a look at its next door neighbor.”  	Reuters

Hundreds of thousands of protesters rallied peacefully in torrential rain on Sunday in the eleventh week of what have been often violent demonstrations.  “I sincerely hope that this was the beginning of society returning to peace and staying away from violence,” Lam said.  “We will immediately start the work to establish a platform for dialogue. This dialogue, I hope, will be based on a mutual understanding and respect and find a way out for today’s Hong Kong.”  Anger erupted in June over a now-suspended bill that would allow criminal suspects in the former British colony to be extradited to mainland China for trial.  The unrest has been fueled by broader worries about the erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula put in place after Hong Kong’s return to China in 1997, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.  Three people were wounded, one critically, in a knife attack  by an unknown assailant near a “Lennon Wall” of colorful pro-protest messages in the city’s Tseung Kwan O district in the New Territories overnight, police said. One man was arrested.  The protests have prompted sharp reactions from Beijing, which has accused foreign countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest in the territory. China has also sent clear warning that forceful intervention is possible, with paramilitary forces holding drills in neighboring Shenzhen.  Britain’s Foreign Office said it was extremely concerned about reports that a Hong Kong staff member had been detained in mainland China, but there was no immediate suggestion that there was any link to the protests. [L4N25G158]  In interviews on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reiterated U.S. calls for China to honor its one country, two systems commitment and said respect their right of demonstrators to protest.  “We very much want to make sure that those folks who have the desire in their hearts to protest, to speak out on behalf of their own freedom, their own liberty, can do so,” he told CNBC’s Squawk Box.   “They should do so in a peaceful way, and the Chinese government should respect their right to speak out in the way that they’re speaking out.”  Speaking to CBS This Morning, Pompeo stressed the important U.S. business interests in Hong Kong and added: “The impact on Hong Kong, if this isn’t resolved in a way that is peaceful and in accordance with those agreements, I think will be significant.”  Pompeo highlighted weekend remarks by President Donald Trump warning against a crackdown like Beijing’s bloody suppression of pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Trump said this would make reaching a deal he has been seeking to end a trade war with China “very hard”.  In an editorial on Tuesday, China’s influential state-run tabloid, The Global Times, called comments by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Monday linking the trade talks to the Hong Kong protests “outrageous”.   U.S. tech giants Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc said on Monday they had dismantled a state-backed social media campaign originating in mainland China that sought to undermine protests in Hong Kong.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined direct comment on the Twitter and Facebook actions, but defended the right of Chinese people to make their voices heard.  Further demonstrations are planned in the next few days, including by MTR subway workers on Wednesday, secondary school students on Thursday and accountants on Friday.  The protests are exacting a toll on Hong Kong’s economy and tourism, with the Asian financial hub on the verge of its first recession in a decade.  Singapore universities have canceled exchange programs to Hong Kong after Singapore warned its citizens to defer travel there, news website Today reported.  Singapore’s foreign ministry said in an advisory last week large protests in Hong Kong had become unpredictable and could turn violent with little or no notice.  Sunday’s protest turnout, which organizers put at 1.7 million, showed the movement still has widespread support despite chaotic scenes last week when protesters occupied the airport.  Some activists had apologized for the airport turmoil and protesters could be seen on Sunday night urging others to go home peacefully.  Aside from seeking Lam’s resignation, demonstrators have five demands - complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as “rioting”, a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.  “The bill is dead,” Lam told Tuesday’s news briefing. “There is no plan to revive the bill, especially in light of the public concerns.”  Police have been criticized for using aggressive tactics to break up demonstrations but there was a minimal police presence on Sunday and no arrests were made. More than 700 people have been arrested since June.  Lam said the police watchdog had set up a task force to investigate complaints.  She said she hoped Hong Kong had “unique advantages in attracting overseas companies”, stressing the rule of law, but warned of the risk of pressure on the economy which shrank 0.4% in April-June from the previous quarter.  “The Hong Kong economy is facing the risk of downturn. We can see this from the data in the first half. Actually, I think the data in the first half has not fully reflected the seriousness of the problem,” she said.  China has put strong pressure on big companies in Hong Kong over the protests, especially Cathay Pacific Airways. CEO Rupert Hogg quit in a shock move last week after Beijing targeted the airline over staff involvement in the protests.  China’s State Council called on Monday for greater development of Shenzhen and integration of its culture and economy with neighboring Hong Kong and Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave that returned to China in 1999.

Twitter Inc said on Monday it suspended 936 accounts and the operations appeared to be a coordinated state-backed effort originating in China.  Facebook Inc said it had removed accounts and pages from a small network after a tip from Twitter. Facebook said its investigation found links to individuals associated with the Chinese government.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined direct comment on the Twitter and Facebook actions, but defended the right of Chinese people and media to make their voices heard over the Hong Kong protests.  Overseas Chinese and students “of course have the right to express their point of view”, he told a daily news briefing.  “What is happening in Hong Kong, and what the truth is, people will naturally have their own judgment. Why is it that China’s official media’s presentation is surely negative or wrong?” he added.  Twitter and Facebook have come under fire from users over showing ads from state-controlled media that criticized the Hong Kong protesters. Twitter said Monday it would no longer accept advertising from state-controlled news media, and told Reuters the change was not related to the suspended accounts.  Twitter and Facebook are blocked by the Chinese government from being used in the mainland, but are freely accessible in Hong Kong, where protests since June have plunged the Chinese-ruled territory into its most serious crisis in decades.  Chinese media use foreign social media to communicate with people around the world to introduce them to Chinese policies and “tell China’s story”, Geng said.   “I don’t know why certain companies or peoples’ reaction is so strong,” he added.  The Hong Kong protests present one of the biggest challenges for China’s President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.  They began in opposition to a now-suspended bill that would allow suspects to be sent to the mainland for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts, but have since swelled into wider calls for democracy.  Social media companies globally are under pressure to stem illicit political influence campaigns online, especially ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November 2020.

Cosmetic companies like Estee Lauder and L’Oreal (OREP.PA) are seeing a boom in their business in the Asia-Pacific region, mainly in China, as affluent millennials spend more at beauty retailers and duty-free stores at airports.  Shares of Estee Lauder, which reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, rose as much as 11% to $198.62.  The company has been selling 10 of its brands including M.A.C and Tom Ford on Alibaba’s (BABA.N) online marketplace Tmall, in a bid to boost its presence in the Asian market.  The efforts helped sales in the Asia-Pacific region grow 18% in the fourth quarter, while sales in the skincare business, its biggest and most profitable, rose 15% to $1.59 billion, boosted by demand for its premium skincare brands such as La Mer and Clinique.   Estee Lauder expects full-year sales to grow in the range of 7% to 8% and adjusted profit between $5.90 and $5.98 per share in fiscal 2020.  Analysts had expected sales growth of 6.87% and profit of $5.81 per share.  Estee Lauder, which also forecast first-quarter sales growth and profit above expectations, said the outlook took into account the potential impact of the Hong Kong protests and the protracted U.S.-China trade dispute, as well as costs related to Britain’s impending exit from the European Union.  “We are not seeing any slowdown in China at this point in time” Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Freda said.  Freda said Hong Kong, including travel retail, represented less than 4% of the company’s business globally, and the company was working to recover some of the potential losses in Hong Kong from other markets.  “We are a little surprised by Estee’s aggressive approach to guidance for the year,” RBC analyst Nik Modi said.  Overall, quarterly net sales rose 9% to $3.59 billion, beating expectations of $3.53 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.      Excluding items, it earned 64 cents per share, beating estimates by 11 cents. 	Reuters

Just get out of here!”  In examples provided by Facebook, posts described the protesters as cockroaches who “refused to show their faces.”  Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy Nathaniel Gleicher told reporters that the bulk of the Facebook accounts were created in 2018.   Both Twitter and Facebook are blocked in mainland China by the government but available in Hong Kong.  Twitter and Facebook have come under fire from users over showing ads from state-controlled media that criticized the Hong Kong protesters.   In response, Twitter said Monday it would no longer accept advertising from state-controlled news media. Twitter told Reuters the advertising change was not related to the suspended accounts. (bit.ly/2Za5Pxn)  In the past week, China’s official Xinhua news agency and state broadcaster China Global Television Network (CGTN) paid to promote videos that portrayed the protests as violent and said Hong Kong citizens wanted the demonstrations to end, according to Twitter’s Ads Transparency Center.  Twitter said it did not have data on how much revenue it generates from state-controlled media advertising.   Many countries including the United States do not have clear standards on state media’s purchase of online advertising.  Total digital ad spending in Hong Kong will grow 11% to reach $786.1 million in 2019, according to projections by U.S. digital market data analyst eMarketer.  Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) YouTube video service told Reuters in June that state-owned media companies maintained the same privileges as any other user, including the ability to run ads in accordance with its rules. YouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday on whether it had detected inauthentic content related to protests in Hong Kong.   In a tweet on Sunday, China’s influential state-run tabloid, The Global Times, hailed the response of Chinese “netizens” to the protests, saying: “Chinese netizens’ power! Amid escalating protests in Hong Kong, Chinese netizens on Saturday swept Facebook and Instagram to denounce secessionist posts and show support for Hong Kong police.”  About 98% of social network users in Hong Kong, or 4.7 million people, will log into Facebook at least once a month in 2019, according to eMarketer projections, while 9.4% of social network users will use Twitter.  Shares of Facebook rose 1.3% and Twitter rose 2.8%. 	Reuters

Cosmetic companies like Estee Lauder and L’Oreal (OREP.PA) are seeing a boom in their business in the Asia-Pacific region, mainly in China, as affluent millennials spend more at beauty retailers and duty-free stores at airports.  Shares of Estee Lauder, which reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, rose as much as 11% to $198.62.  The company has been selling 10 of its brands including M.A.C and Tom Ford on Alibaba’s (BABA.N) online marketplace Tmall, in a bid to boost its presence in the Asian market.  The efforts helped sales in the Asia-Pacific region grow 18% in the fourth quarter, while sales in the skincare business, its biggest and most profitable, rose 15% to $1.59 billion, boosted by demand for its premium skincare brands such as La Mer and Clinique.   Estee Lauder expects full-year sales to grow in the range of 7% to 8% and adjusted profit between $5.90 and $5.98 per share in fiscal 2020.  Analysts had expected sales growth of 6.87% and profit of $5.81 per share.  Estee Lauder, which also forecast first-quarter sales growth and profit above expectations, said the outlook took into account the potential impact of the Hong Kong protests and the protracted U.S.-China trade dispute, as well as costs related to Britain’s impending exit from the European Union.  “We are not seeing any slowdown in China at this point in time” Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Freda said.  Freda said Hong Kong, including travel retail, represented less than 4% of the company’s business globally, and the company was working to recover some of the potential losses in Hong Kong from other markets.  “We are a little surprised by Estee’s aggressive approach to guidance for the year,” RBC analyst Nik Modi said.  Overall, quarterly net sales rose 9% to $3.59 billion, beating expectations of $3.53 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.      Excluding items, it earned 64 cents per share, beating estimates by 11 cents. 	Reuters

Sunday’s turnout showed that the movement still has broad-based support despite the ugly scenes witnessed in recent days  when protesters occupied the Chinese-ruled city’s airport, a move for which some activists apologized.  It was the calmest weekend protest since the latest demonstrations against perceived creeping Beijing influence in the former British colony began.  “They’ve been telling everyone we’re rioters. The march today is to show everyone we are not,” said a 23-year-old named Chris, who works in marketing and was dressed all in black, including a scarf covering his face and baseball cap.  “It does not mean we won’t keep fighting. We will do whatever is necessary to win, but today we take a break, then we reassess.”  One protester shouted at others who were jeering at police, “Today is a peaceful march! Don’t fall into the trap! The world is watching us,” prompting the group to move on.  Late in the evening, some demonstrators were urging others to go home and rest.  Anger erupted in June over a now-suspended bill that would allow criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China, but the unrest has been fueled by broader worries about the erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula put in place after Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule in 1997, including an independent judiciary and right to protest.  The protests present one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012,  with the ruling Communist Party preparing to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic on Oct. 1.  Protesters held aloft placards with slogans including “Free Hong Kong!” and “Democracy now!” and umbrellas to shield them from the sometimes heavy rain.  Some aimed green lasers at police and government buildings. The crowd in Causeway Bay’s leafy Victoria Park, where the rally started, included elderly people and young families, with some parents carrying toddlers.  Despite rally organizers not having permission to march, the park could not accommodate the crowd, which thronged nearby  streets. Many protesters headed towards Hong Kong’s financial center, chanting for the city’s Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, to step down.  It was impossible to put an exact figure on the number of protesters. The organizers put the number at 1.7 million, adding they had applied for permission to march to the Hong Kong Liaison Office, Beijing’s main representative body in the city, on the last day of the month.  Police estimated there were 128,000 people in Victoria Park at the height of the protest.  “It’s bloody hot and it’s raining. It’s a torture just to turn up, frankly. But we have to be here because we have no other choice,” said a 24-year-old student named Jonathan.   “We have to continue until the government finally shows us the respect that we deserve.”  A government spokesman said the protests were generally peaceful, but they had disrupted traffic badly.   “The most important thing at present is to restore social order as soon as possible,” he said. “When everything is calm, the government will engage in a sincere dialogue with the public to fix the social rifts and rebuild social harmony.”  Aside from Lam’s resignation, demonstrators are seeking complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as “rioting”, a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.  Speaking to reporters before boarding Air Force One in New Jersey on Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump drew parallels between the violent protests in Hong Kong and Beijing’s bloody suppression of student-led pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989.   He added that he supported liberty and democracy in Hong Kong and said that he hoped the situation would be resolved in a “humanitarian” fashion.  “When we were young, we didn’t think about it. But my son tells me: After 2047, what will happen to me?” said a history teacher named Poon, referring to the year when the 50-year agreement enshrining Hong Kong’s separate system will lapse.  “I will come again and again and again. We do not know how any of this is going to end. We will still fight,” she said.  Police have come under criticism for using increasingly aggressive tactics to break up demonstrations and on Sunday some people handed out balloons resembling eyeballs, a reference to the injury suffered by a female medic hit by a pellet round in the eye.  On Saturday, however, a demonstration in support of the government attracted what organizers said was 476,000 people, although police put the number of attendees at 108,000.   Beijing has struck an increasingly strident tone over the protests, accusing foreign countries including the United States of fomenting unrest.  Scenes of Chinese paramilitary troops training this past week at a stadium in the city of Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, gave a clear warning that mainland intervention by force is possible.  Last week, protesters who occupied the terminal at Hong Kong’s airport forced the cancellation of nearly 1,000 flights and detained two men they thought were pro-government sympathizers, prompting Beijing to liken the behavior to terrorism.  “We are Hong Kongers. We are here for our future. We feel for the teenagers,” said Frances Chan, 60, a retired journalist attending Sunday’s rally.  She said only a few protesters had used violence, sparingly, brought on by pressure from the authorities.  “Actually, we want peace and freedom,” she said. 	Reuters

The directive comes as anti-government protests in Hong Kong threaten the status of the Asian financial hub.  Hong Kong, one of the world’s busiest ports, is on the verge of its first recession in a decade as violent anti-government protests scare off tourists and bite into retail sales and investment.  The State Council 19-point directive, published in state-media outlet People’s Daily, calls for Shenzhen’s “economic strength and development” to rank among the best in the world by 2025, and a “global benchmark” by the middle of the century.  In the 1990s, market-oriented reforms and government support transformed Shenzhen from an ordinary Chinese village to a major hub for China’s manufacturing and technology sectors.  The city now houses the global headquarters for Tencent, China’s social media giant, and Huawei, the networking equipment maker that U.S. President Donald Trump effectively barred U.S. companies from supplying.        The directive called for the “modernization of social governance” in Shenzhen via the “comprehensive application of big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and other technologies.”  It called for the integration of the culture and economy of Shenzhen with Hong Kong and Macao via funding for hospitals, joint disaster relief efforts and cultural exchanges, and to further develop the Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and “enrich the new practice of the ‘one country, two systems’ policy.”  Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that promised wide-ranging freedoms denied to citizens in mainland China, but many in the city believe Beijing has been eroding those freedoms.  Hong Kong’s protests started as opposition to a now-suspended extradition bill to mainland China and have swelled into wider calls for democracy.   Last week China’s paramilitary forces carried out exercises outside of a major sports stadium in Shenzhen, sparking speculation that they may be used in Hong Kong. 	Reuters

(Repeats story for Asian day, with no changes to text)  * HK listing likely to raise $10 bln-$15 bln-sources  * Company considering several different timetables-sources  * In talks with HKEX listing group, hasn’t appeared for hearing-sources  By Jennifer Hughes and Julie  Zhu  HONG KONG, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Hong Kong’s political unrest is posing a dilemma for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd on the timing of its planned $15 billion listing in the city, with sources saying China’s biggest e-commerce company is now considering several timetables.  New York-listed Alibaba was most likely to launch the offer - potentially the world’s biggest of the year - as early as the third quarter, sources have said, and late August, after its first-quarter earnings, was widely viewed as the most likely window.  In preparation for the giant offer, bankers advising other large listings in Hong Kong have been careful to avoid planning their launches around that period, fearing that a clash of timing would crowd out their offerings.  But not a word was mentioned by Alibaba on the Hong Kong listing when it released estimate-beating earnings on Thursday nor did the offer come up in the hour-long discussion with analysts after the results.  Two sources involved in the deal and one other briefed on Alibaba’s discussions described the company’s thinking on the deal as “fluid” and said Alibaba was considering several timetables.  Alibaba declined to comment.  The Hong Kong listing deal was estimated at up to $20 billion, but is more likely, according to sources close to the deal, to raise between $10-$15 billion.  The listing was always expected to be a complex affair because of China’s tight control of cross-border share trading, but Hong Kong’s unrest has taken the complexity several notches higher.  More than 10 weeks of confrontations between police and pro-democracy protesters have plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997 and presented President Xi Jinping with his biggest popular challenge since taking power in 2012.  Tear gas has been used frequently by police while more than 700 people have been arrested.  This week protesters effectively closed the city’s airport on two successive days, disrupting tens of thousands of travellers and posing a practical problem to any company considering launching a deal roadshow in Hong Kong.  Under the circumstances, when Alibaba lists becomes crucial as it sends a signal to the rest of the world on the state of Hong Kong as a business and financial centre and provides a window into China’s reading of the situation.  “How do you think Beijing feels about giving Hong Kong a $15 billion gift like this, right now?” asked one capital markets professional not involved in the Alibaba deal.  A listing by Alibaba is a big deal for Hong Kong, which loosened its rules last year specifically to lure overseas-listed Chinese tech giants to list closer to home.  Alibaba would be the first to test the new system.  Asked this week whether Hong Kong’s turmoil would affect its listing, Hong Kong stock exchange chief executive Charles Li avoided directly acknowledging the company’s application, which is still technically confidential.  But Li added: “I am confident that companies like that ultimately will find a home here, because this is home and I think they will come. I don’t know when though.”  Alibaba’s Hong Kong listing is also sensitive for China, which has been working to give mainland investors a bigger role in funding the country’s fast-growing tech sector.  Officials are conscious that capital controls and the U.S. listing preference of most of China’s first-generation tech giants mean that international shareholders have profited far more from their success than local investors. Mainland investors can buy Hong Kong shares through the so-called Stock Connect, which allows investors in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong to trade shares listed on each others’ exchanges.  But the inclusion of Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares in the Stock Connect is not guaranteed because the scheme does not yet allow mainland buying of companies which have weighted their voting rights in favour of founders, such as smartphone maker Xiaomi and Meituan Dianping, the online food delivery-to-ticketing firm. Both took advantage last year of another Hong Kong rule change to float in Hong Kong with weighted voting rights structures.  While Alibaba has a single class of shares with equal votes, its governance is not considered standard since its board is controlled by a self-selecting group of company insiders.  Chinese regulators have said they will allow local investors to trade companies with weighted voting rights, but have not yet set a date for doing so.  Alibaba’s deal must also overcome one other technical hurdle: it must gain the approval of the city’s listing committee, a 27-strong independent group of industry professionals whose consent is needed for all first-time share sales.  The company has been in discussions with the committee but has not yet appeared before the group at one of its regular Thursday hearings for formal approval, according to three sources.  So far only Credit Suisse and CICC, the Chinese investment bank, have been mandated for the mega-listing, sources said, although several other banks are jockeying for a role on the deal, they added.  All are expected to be urging caution on the listing given the size of the deal and the political and market considerations.  One senior banker not involved said it made no sense to move too quickly. 	Reuters

Weeks of increasingly violent demonstrations have plunged the city into turmoil. Water-filled barricades fortify the airport and government offices. Posters showing bloody clashes are stuck on street corners and there is a protest nearly every night.  The unrest began in June in opposition to a now-suspended extradition bill, and have since grown to include broader demands.  Following an escalation in violence over the past few days, rallies on Saturday and Sunday are a test of whether the movement can retain the broad support it has appeared to enjoy.  Saturday’s mostly peaceful protest suggested that it may - though thousands also attended a pro-police counter-rally, and a clearer picture is not likely to emerge until Sunday when a protest is scheduled that could draw tens of thousands.  “The government has been ignoring us for months. We have to keep demonstrating,” said CS Chan, a maths teacher at a rally of teachers, which police said up to 8,300 people had attended, in heavy rain. Organisers said 22,000 were present.     Demonstrators say they are fighting the erosion of the “one country, two systems” arrangement that has enshrined some autonomy for Hong Kong since China took it back from Britain in 1997.  During the past week they have increasingly directed their frustration toward police, who have responded with fiercer determination to clear them from the streets.  As storms cleared, anti-government demonstrators also marched through Kowloon - the main built-up area on the mainland side of Hong Kong harbour - while large pro-police crowds rallied in a harbourside park across the bay.  “I’m heartbroken to see the city being split up like this,” a retired telecoms technician, Michael Law, 69, told Reuters at the pro-police rally. “What the violent protesters have been doing shows no respect for Hong Kong’s rule of law.”  Organisers said 476,000 people attended the pro-police rally, while police said 108,000 attended. Reuters was not able to verify either estimate.  Many shops in Kowloon had shut early, even on big retail boulevards, in anticipation of clashes that have tended to turn nasty at night as front-line activists attack police.  On Saturday, protesters who had surrounded a police station soon vanished when riot officers advanced with shields and batons.  Some said they were saving their energy for Sunday, when the pro-democracy Civil Human Rights Front, which organised million-strong peaceful marches in June, has scheduled another protest.  The increasingly violent confrontations have plunged one of Asia’s financial capitals into its worst crisis for decades. The unrest also presents one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.  Hong Kong’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, has warned activists not tip their home into an abyss.  The European Union urged all sides to engage in dialogue, following other calls for restraint as Chinese paramilitary police have run drills close to the Hong Kong border.  Police in Australia also warned supporters and opponents of the Hong Kong protest movement to behave after scuffles at a rally in Melbourne. [nL8N25D04J]  Chinese officials have likened some actions by protesters to “terrorism” and Chinese state media outlets have urged Hong Kong police to respond more robustly.        Protesters have used slingshots to fire marbles at police, shone lasers at them and at times thrown bricks and firebombs.  Having fired tear gas to disperse protesters in the streets, and at one point in a subway station, police are warning that they could get tougher.  Although their stations have been attacked scores of times during the crisis, they have so far refrained from deploying water cannon, armoured cars or the dog squad.  They have made some 750 arrests, charging some protesters with rioting, which can attract a 10-year jail term.         But many remain on the side of the demonstrators.      Yu, a secondary school music teacher in her 40s, said she was determined to show support for protesting students, even though she did not agree with all their actions:  “I do appreciate their courage and caring about Hong Kong ... they are definitely braver than our government.” 	Reuters

The police said that they interviewed two men in relation to “unlawful assault” and released them pending summons, after pushing and shoving took place at the rally organized in support of the Hong Kong protesters. Australian media reported the rally attracted 600 people at its peak.  No injuries were reported.   On Saturday, more than 100 people gathered in downtown Melbourne for another rally in support of protesters in Hong Kong. The Guardian reported that a handful of people began shouting at the group but police escorted them from the rally.

I don’t know when though.”   Alibaba’s Hong Kong listing is also sensitive for China, which has been working to give mainland investors a bigger role in funding the country’s fast-growing tech sector.  Officials are conscious that capital controls and the U.S. listing preference of most of China’s first-generation tech giants mean that international shareholders have profited far more from their success than local investors.  Mainland investors can buy Hong Kong shares through the so-called Stock Connect, which allows investors in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong to trade shares listed on each others’ exchanges.  But the inclusion of Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares in the Stock Connect is not guaranteed because the scheme does not yet allow mainland buying of companies which have weighted their voting rights in favor of founders, such as smartphone maker Xiaomi (1810.HK) and Meituan Dianping (3690.HK), the online food delivery-to-ticketing firm. Both took advantage last year of another Hong Kong rule change to float in Hong Kong with weighted voting rights structures.   While Alibaba has a single class of shares with equal votes, its governance is not considered standard since its board is controlled by a self-selecting group of company insiders.  Chinese regulators have said they will allow local investors to trade companies with weighted voting rights, but have not yet set a date for doing so.  Alibaba’s deal must also overcome one other technical hurdle: it must gain the approval of the city’s listing committee, a 27-strong independent group of industry professionals whose consent is needed for all first-time share sales.  The company has been in discussions with the committee but has not yet appeared before the group at one of its regular Thursday hearings for formal approval, according to three sources.   So far only Credit Suisse and CICC, the Chinese investment bank, have been mandated for the mega-listing, sources said, although several other banks are jockeying for a role on the deal, they added.   All are expected to be urging caution on the listing given the size of the deal and the political and market considerations.  One senior banker not involved said it made no sense to move too quickly.  “Why would Alibaba rush to kick it off?” he asked. 	Reuters

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong’s political unrest is posing a dilemma for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) on the timing of its planned $15 billion listing in the city, with sources saying China’s biggest e-commerce company is now considering several timetables.  New York-listed Alibaba was most likely to launch the offer - potentially the world’s biggest of the year - as early as the third quarter, sources have said, and late August, after its first-quarter earnings, was widely viewed as the most likely window.  In preparation for the giant offer, bankers advising other large listings in Hong Kong have been careful to avoid planning their launches around that period, fearing that a clash of timing would crowd out their offerings.  But not a word was mentioned by Alibaba on the Hong Kong listing when it released estimate-beating earnings on Thursday nor did the offer come up in the hour-long discussion with analysts after the results.  Two sources involved in the deal and one other briefed on Alibaba’s discussions described the company’s thinking on the deal as “fluid” and said Alibaba was considering several timetables.  Alibaba declined to comment.  The Hong Kong listing deal was estimated at up to $20 billion, but is more likely, according to sources close to the deal, to raise between $10-$15 billion.   The listing was always expected to be a complex affair because of China’s tight control of cross-border share trading, but Hong Kong’s unrest has taken the complexity several notches higher.  More than 10 weeks of confrontations between police and pro-democracy protesters have plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997 and presented President Xi Jinping with his biggest popular challenge since taking power in 2012.  Tear gas has been used frequently by police while more than 700 people have been arrested.  This week protesters effectively closed the city’s airport on two successive days, disrupting tens of thousands of travelers and posing a practical problem to any company considering launching a deal roadshow in Hong Kong.  Under the circumstances, when Alibaba lists becomes crucial as it sends a signal to the rest of the world on the state of Hong Kong as a business and financial center and provides a window into China’s reading of the situation.  “How do you think Beijing feels about giving Hong Kong a $15 billion gift like this, right now?” asked one capital markets professional not involved in the Alibaba deal.  A listing by Alibaba is a big deal for Hong Kong, which loosened its rules last year specifically to lure overseas-listed Chinese tech giants to list closer to home.  Alibaba would be the first to test the new system.   Asked this week whether Hong Kong’s turmoil would affect its listing, Hong Kong stock exchange chief executive Charles Li avoided directly acknowledging the company’s application, which is still technically confidential.   But Li added: “I am confident that companies like that ultimately will find a home here, because this is home and I think they will come. I don’t know when though.”   Alibaba’s Hong Kong listing is also sensitive for China, which has been working to give mainland investors a bigger role in funding the country’s fast-growing tech sector.

571	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1V60PM	August 16, 2019 /  9:01 AM / in 8 months	Special Report: Rudderless rebellion - Inside the Hong Kong protesters' anarchic campaign against China	HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ah Lung spends his days working as a clerk for a Hong Kong shipping firm. At night, he dons a mask, black helmet and body armor, and heads out into the streets to face off against the city’s riot police.  The 25-year-old activist has been a constant presence at the often violent protests that have rocked Hong Kong this summer, rallying comrades, building barricades and rushing from district to district in a frantic game of cat-and-mouse with police.  Ah Lung, who would only identify himself by his nickname, which means “dragon” in Cantonese, is representative of a growing number of discontented young Hong Kongers who are fueling a protest movement that, unlike its predecessors, is taking aim directly at Beijing.  It is a movement without clearly discernible leaders or structure, making it difficult for the authorities to effectively target — and increasingly hard for the protesters themselves to manage.   While it has the support of established pro-democracy groups, the amorphous movement is fueled by activists like Ah Lung – young Hong Kongers who operate independently or in small groups and adapt their tactics on the run.  “We’re not so organized,” Ah Lung said. “Every day changes, and we see what the police and the government do, then we take action.”  “My dream is to revive Hong Kong, to bring a revolution in our time,” Ah Lung said. “This is the meaning of my life now.”  Through interviews with dozens of protesters like Ah Lung and reporting from dozens of protests, Reuters has pieced together a picture of how this movement functions and the mindset driving it.  The protests, which started as a peaceful rebuke of the Hong Kong government back in April, have evolved into a direct challenge to Communist Party rule over this former British colony.   With slogans such as “Free Hong Kong” and “Hong Kong is not China,” Ah Lung and his fellow protesters have made clear they reject a future in which Hong Kong is inexorably absorbed into the mainland giant, eventually becoming just another Chinese city.  Protesters are provocatively calling the demonstrations an “era of revolution,” a formulation that has infuriated a ruling Chinese Communist Party determined to crush any challenge to its monopoly on power.  Scenes once unthinkable in Hong Kong are now commonplace: The city’s international airport being shut down this week after a prolonged occupation by protesters; a Chinese official publicly suggesting that aspects of some of the protests were terrorism; the legislature stormed and ransacked by protesters; police officers repeatedly baton-charging crowds of protesters and unleashing torrents of tear gas in famed shopping districts.  On Tuesday, protesters who managed to shut down the airport also attacked a Chinese man for being a suspected undercover agent. He was identified as a reporter for the Global Times, a tabloid controlled by Beijing, highlighting how activists are making the Chinese government the target of their protests.   It also brought another issue into focus: the risks of waging a  leaderless rebellion. Demonstrators later apologized for the disruptions at the airport, apparently concerned that their chaotic protests might alienate broader sections of the Hong Kong public who had been supporting them.  “The movement has a large degree of self-restraint and solidarity, but of course that’s very conditional,” said Samson Yuen, a political scientist at Lingnan University in Hong Kong who has conducted surveys of protesters to understand their motives and support base.   “If certain actions spin out of control, if say someone dies from it, then that might be a game-changer.”  ONE-COUNTRY, TWO-SYSTEMS  Under the “one-country, two-systems” formula, China promised Hong Kong it would enjoy autonomy for 50 years after its handover from Britain in 1997.   Unlike those who negotiated the deal, for young protesters born after the handover that deadline will fall in the middle of their lives. And, as Beijing tightens its grip on Hong Kong, the future they see careening toward them is that of an authoritarian mainland China with curbs on the freedoms and rights they now enjoy.  “In 2047, if it returns to China, real Hong Kongers will leave and emigrate from Hong Kong,” said Ah Lung, speaking in a small apartment in the Sham Shui Po neighborhood as he prepared for a night of protests that quickly descended into violence.  “By then, it won’t be Hong Kong anymore, but Xiang Gang,” he said, referring to the name commonly used on the mainland for Hong Kong.  Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has said that protesters’ calls for a revolution to “liberate” Hong Kong are illegal acts that challenge the authority of the central government in Beijing.   In response to questions from Reuters about the protests, a spokesman for Lam referred to her promise to address income disparities in the city once the violence subsides.  The Hong Kong Liaison Office, Beijing’s main representative arm in the city, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond to questions from Reuters.  The Hong Kong police did not respond to questions from Reuters. During the protests, police spokesmen have repeatedly defended the use of force and have pointed to escalating violence by protesters that has included throwing bricks and fire bombs.  The protesters’ mantra – “Be water!” – epitomizes the movement’s tactics. A phrase borrowed from the Hong Kong movie star Bruce Lee, who used it to describe his kung fu philosophy, it is a call for flexibility and creativity, moving forward to press an advantage and pulling back when a strategic retreat is needed.  Its latest manifestation is the series of wildcat protests that have spread across the city in recent weeks. When police turn up in numbers at one protest, the activists often engage them, tying down officers before melting away and reappearing to stage a fresh protest in another area.  Pro-democracy protests that paralyzed much of downtown Hong Kong in 2014 involved blocking several key roads for more than two months. The more fluid tactics now being deployed by protesters, often masked to avoid surveillance and dressed in black, present a greater challenge for the police. Frontline officers speak of exhaustion, saying they never know where the activists will strike next.  Protesters say their movement is leaderless. In some ways, that’s a reaction to the 2014 demonstrations in which many of the leaders were arrested and given prison terms.   Unlike those protests, when leaders like Joshua Wong became globally recognized names, frontline activists like Ah Lung are deliberately staying under the radar, using pseudonyms and appearing at protests with their faces obscured by masks and sunglasses.  The leaderless nature of the protest movement is made possible, to a large extent, by social media.  Protesters take their cues from more than 100 groups on the instant messaging app Telegram, dozens of Instagram sites and online forums like LIHKG. The groups are used to post everything from news on upcoming protests to tips on dousing tear gas canisters fired by the police to the identities of suspected undercover police and the access codes to buildings in Hong Kong where protesters can hide.  It’s not an issue of having “no leader, it simply means that everyone is a leader,” said one 22-year-old Hong Kong student based in Britain who helps run “antielabhk,” an Instagram page that includes details about protests that has amassed more than 50,000 followers. The student asked not to be named.  Ma, a 28-year-old university student who would only give her surname, said at a recent protest in the volatile Mongkok district that she had come after seeing recruitment appeals in a Telegram group. “We were only notified or briefed today – like an hour ago,” said Ma, as she handed out water to protesters.  A feature of the protests in recent weeks has been the sight of ordinary activists like Ah Lung, the shipping clerk, rallying other protesters.  In Sham Shui Po on Sunday, Ah Lung joined other masked “frontliners” as the protest began. Some used wrenches to loosen bolts on roadside fences, which were then shaken loose, bound with nylon ties, and formed into makeshift barricades against the police.   Ah Lung, brandishing a Star Wars light saber he had bought at a toy shop, called out instructions on where to position the barricades. As they worked, other masked protesters used hand-held telescopes to track police movements.  The improvised, bottom-up nature of the protest movement is further evident in the scores of medics, some of them medical staff from local hospitals, who say they have turned up unprompted at protest sites to treat the wounded and administer saline solution to tear gas victims.  Kay, a 28-year-old medic who works in information technology and would only give her first name, said she prepared an emergency kit, including  iodine, bandages, tourniquets and saline solution before every protest.   “I was hit by a tear gas canister one time and then when I retreated to a safe spot, some people helped me. I felt touched, and I wanted to help some people back.”  While the protest movement may not have clearly identifiable leaders, it does have the backing of prominent pro-democracy activists and groups who have organized some of the demonstrations. In the past, they have led smaller, more orderly demonstrations that were not aimed so pointedly at the leadership in Beijing.  Reuters reporting shows there is a high degree of coordination among a small circle of these activists, many of whom participated in the 2014 protests that were sparked by Beijing’s refusal to grant Hong Kong universal suffrage.  For instance, members of Demosisto, a party that advocates for greater democracy in Hong Kong, have been behind a number of demonstrations, some of which ended in violent clashes with riot police, according to the group’s members.  Last month, Tobias Leung, a member of the party’s standing committee, applied for police permission to stage a rally in the suburban district of Sha Tin. Leung’s link to the protest wasn’t immediately clear because he applied under the name of a local community group, according to Wong, the leader of Demosisto.  Wong and other prominent activists have been present at various demonstrations, sometimes close to the front lines. But they have struggled to impose leadership on the streets, with the protesters debating amongst themselves and consulting their phone groups on what action to take.  Along with other prominent democrats in the city, Wong has been seen at protests by Reuters being shouted down by activists who say they don’t want the movement hijacked by any single leader or group.  “I’m quite happy people are saying we should not rely on any specific political leader to lead this movement,” Wong told Reuters.   Jailed independence activist Edward Leung, who is revered by many of the protesters, is currently serving a six-year sentence for rioting stemming from a protest in 2016.  Francis Lee, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who has written a book on Hong Kong social movements, describes the protests as an “open source” movement. Protesters often aggregate the best ideas in online groups and vote on courses of action, he said.  China has accused foreign countries of being behind the protests. Both Western and Asian diplomats in the city monitor the protests closely and some have been seen at events. Diplomats say this is part of their routine work.   The protests erupted in late April over a bill proposed by Lam that would have allowed the extradition of defendants from Hong Kong to mainland China. Unlike the demand for universal suffrage, which fueled the 2014 protests, the extradition bill was seen as a specific, tangible threat by many Hong Kongers, galvanizing hundreds of thousands of people.      Facing huge protests, Lam announced on June 15 that she was freezing the bill.   That wasn’t enough for many Hong Kong residents, many of whom flooded onto the streets in one of the largest protest marches ever seen in the city, largely organized by a coalition of civil society groups. The march brought together a diverse cross-section of Hong Kong society, including members of the city’s politically conservative middle class.  A major turning point in the protests was an assault on July 21 on Beijing’s Central Government Liaison Office – the most prominent symbol of China’s authority in Hong Kong.   Black-clad activists arrived at dusk at the glass-steel skyscraper that bears the red state seal of China above its entrance. As the crowd quickly swelled to thousands, some protesters hurled eggs at the building. Others used spray paint to scrawl the words “Revolution of Our Time” on the walls.  Some tried to neutralize surveillance cameras by targeting them with laser pointers. To roars of approval, protesters then lobbed black paint at the state seal of China.  “Carrie Lam has refused to listen to our concerns about Communist Party interference,” said one 27-year-old protester who would only give his name as Paul, as he attached vials of anti-tear gas fluid onto his military style backpack. “Now we have to send our message to the communists directly.”  The Liaison Office has since become the target of repeated protests.  Nick Tsang, a protester clad in a black balaclava and black clothes, was in a crowd that began congregating in a Hong Kong park on the afternoon of July 28.   Tsang checked out a Telegram group to see where other protesters were going. One group of protesters splintered off and headed to the city’s police headquarters, while another group branched out in the direction of the Causeway Bay shopping district. Later on, some backtracked toward the Liaison Office. Tsang followed them.  This time, the building was fortified with water-filled plastic barriers, and several battalions of riot police and other elite units. Liaison Office staff, meanwhile, had replaced the sullied state seal with a new one and encased it in a plexiglass box.  Following several hours of heated clashes in the streets around the Liaison Office, a rearguard of protesters, including Tsang, found themselves surrounded by police. With tear gas swirling, they made a run for the Hong Kong subway system and escaped onto a train.  “We can’t retreat or the authoritarianism will worsen,” said Tsang, referring to the Chinese government.  “This is not about me. This is for Hong Kong, my home city.”  (Multimedia package on Hong Kong protests : here) 	Reuters

The Hong Kong protests started as a peaceful rebuke of the government in April but have evolved into a direct challenge to Communist Party rule over this former British colony.  China detained two Canadian men shortly after police arrested Huawei Technologies Co Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. warrant in Vancouver in December.     “The two leaders... discussed relations with China, including the continued arbitrary detention of two Canadians and ongoing developments in Hong Kong,” the statement said.  Canada’s dispute with China has been a nagging headache for Trudeau, and there have been no signs that it will go away before the October national election.  Further mass demonstrations in Hong Kong are expected over the weekend. China has likened the increasingly violent protests to terrorism and warned it could use force to quell them. Trump has urged Chinese President Xi Jinping to meet protesters to defuse the tension.   Trudeau and Trump also reaffirmed their support for the new North American free trade agreement and welcomed work toward its ratification, the statement said. 	Reuters

The corporate upheaval comes ahead of a weekend where further protests are planned, including what could be a large gathering on Sunday that could test whether a movement that has enjoyed broad support can retain it, even as violence escalates.  Demonstrators say they are fighting the erosion of the “one country, two systems” arrangement that has enshrined some autonomy for Hong Kong since China took it back from Britain in 1997.  Several thousand protesters gathered peacefully at a downtown park on Friday for the “Stand with Hong Kong, Power to the People” rally, which had received police permission. Other protests planned for the weekend do not have police permission.   A rally set for Sunday by the Civil Human Rights Front, which organized million-strong marches in June, has only been allowed permission for an assembly in Victoria Park on Hong Kong island, though not a march, due to safety concerns.  The group is appealing against the police decision.  A ban on a march in Kowloon’s Hung Hom district on Saturday was overturned on Friday.  Ten weeks of confrontations between police and protesters have plunged Hong Kong into turmoil, and present the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.  Police tactics against protesters have been hardening.  Nearly 750 people have been arrested since the protests began in June, and tear gas has frequently been used by police in attempts to disperse protests across the city.      China has likened the increasingly violent protests to terrorism and warned it could use force to quell them, as U.S. President Donald Trump urged Xi meet protesters to defuse the tension.  Chinese paramilitary troops have been training this week in Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, in a clear warning to the protesters. Hong Kong police reiterated on Friday that they are capable of maintaining law and order on their own.  Cathay Pacific, an emblem of the city, was blindsided last week when China’s aviation regulator demanded it suspend staff supporting a movement that has mushroomed from opposition to a legal change in Hong Kong into wider calls for democracy.  The abrupt departure of Chief Executive Rupert Hogg, a move the company said was “to take responsibility ... in view of recent events,” shows just how much pressure Beijing is piling on corporate giants and the city as it seeks to snuff out the protests.  Cathay (0293.HK) became embroiled in the confrontation after one of its pilots was arrested at a demonstration in July.  China’s aviation regulator demanded any staff involved or supportive of the protests be removed from duty on flights to or over mainland airspace.  The company, whose chairman had initially said, before the demand, that it “wouldn’t dream” of telling staff what to think, later acceded to the request, firing two pilots and saying  “overly radical” staff would be suspended from mainland duties.  Hogg said these had been “challenging weeks” for the airline and it was right for him, and the company’s chief customer officer who also abruptly quit, to take responsibility.  “Cathay Pacific is fully committed to Hong Kong under the principle of ‘one country, two systems,’” the airline said in a statement.  The protests began as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to mainland China. They have swelled since and demands have broadened.  Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that promised wide-ranging freedoms denied to citizens in mainland China. Many in the city believe Beijing has been eroding those freedoms.  The tenor of clashes intensified this week. Thousands of flights were canceled amid ugly scenes at the city’s airport, when protesters set upon men they suspected were Chinese agents.  At the downtown park, Friday night’s protest was peaceful as demonstrators, ranging from bankers to a retired nurse, held up posters reading “Power to the People”, while police looked on.  In Australia, hundreds turned out in Sydney and Melbourne in support of the Hong Kong protesters, with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reporting some scuffles with pro-Beijing demonstrators in Melbourne.  Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-Shing, urged people to “love China, love Hong Kong and love yourself” in newspaper advertisements that marked his first comments on the crisis.  But Li, 91, and a fixture of Hong Kong business who founded CK Asset Holdings Ltd (1113.HK) and chaired CK Hutchison Holdings (0001.HK), stopped short of explicitly backing the Hong Kong government, as many business leaders have done.  He made no reference to supporting the government or its embattled leader, Carrie Lam, in the advertisements, which encouraged freedom, tolerance and the rule of law.  “I think the government heard the messages from the protesters loud and clear and is diligently racking their brains now for solutions,” Li said.  He warned, “The best cause can lead to the worst results.” 	Reuters

The main index rose 0.7% with all sectors in the black, while the FTSE 250 index outperformed with a 1% rise owing to gains in the local currency. Both indexes recouped some of the steep declines suffered in the last two sessions.  The outage, which was the longest in eight years and delayed trading for almost two hours, came during a volatile week for global financial markets, which were hit by worries about an impending recession and a prolonged U.S.-China trade spat.  Shares of LSE rose 1.9%.  The FTSE 100’s weekly run, which had dragged the index to six-month lows at one point, has placed it on course for its worst month in nearly four years.  On Friday, however, the index was boosted by shares of financial companies, particularly those with a bigger exposure to Asia, after China’s state planner said it would roll out a plan to boost disposable income for 2019-2020 to revive consumption as the economy slows.  U-TURN FROM RECESSION  A report that Germany would be prepared to ditch its balanced budget rule and take on new debt to counter a possible recession also helped the banks break a 5-day losing streak and rise 1.6%. The index has been pressured recently amid the Hong Kong protests.  “Working on the hopeful assumption that central banks are going to step in and try and force the global economy into a U-turn away from a recession, the markets were fairly uniform in their gains,” Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell said.  Precious metals miner Fresnillo, however, fell 1.1% as gold prices fell on investors locking in profits after a strong run.  At home, growing momentum among politicians to stop Britain from crashing out of the European Union without any agreement has buoyed the pound, in turn aiding the domestically-focussed FTSE 250 index.  Among news-driven moves, Mr Kipling owner Premier Foods added 1.2% after Sky News reported overnight that former Reckitt Benckiser CFO Colin Day was among leading contenders to become Premier Foods chairman.  Prudential inched 1% lower after a UK High Court blocked the transfer of 12 billion pounds in annuities from the insurer to Rothesay Life. 	Reuters

Thousands of flights were canceled amid ugly scenes at the city’s airport, when protesters set upon men they suspected were Chinese agents.  At the downtown park, Friday night’s protest was peaceful as demonstrators, ranging from bankers to a retired nurse, held up posters reading “Power to the People”, while police looked on.  In Australia, hundreds turned out in Sydney and Melbourne in support of the Hong Kong protesters, with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reporting some scuffles with pro-Beijing demonstrators in Melbourne.  Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-Shing, urged people to “love China, love Hong Kong and love yourself” in newspaper advertisements that marked his first comments on the crisis.  But Li, 91, and a fixture of Hong Kong business who founded CK Asset Holdings Ltd (1113.HK) and chaired CK Hutchison Holdings (0001.HK), stopped short of explicitly backing the Hong Kong government, as many business leaders have done.  He made no reference to supporting the government or its embattled leader, Carrie Lam, in the advertisements, which encouraged freedom, tolerance and the rule of law.  “I think the government heard the messages from the protesters loud and clear and is diligently racking their brains now for solutions,” Li said.  He warned, “The best cause can lead to the worst results.” 	Reuters

Chief Executive Rupert Hogg and one of his top deputies abruptly resigned on Friday after the company spent a week scrambling to quell a mainland backlash related to Hong Kong protests. The shakeup occurs at an especially bad time for the carrier.  Cathay cryptically cited “safety and security” reasons for replacing Hogg and Paul Loo, the chief customer and commercial officer. The $5 billion airline’s latest struggles, however, relate to employees involved with anti-government demonstrations in Hong Kong. Rebukes and demands from China’s civil aviation officials led to two pilots being sacked, deferential statements from Hogg and new protocols for crews flying in and over the country’s airspace.  Yet the pressure persisted. Beijing-backed enterprises initiated boycotts of Cathay, Hong Kong’s flagship carrier for decades. Analysts at state-owned ICBC put a “strong sell” rating on the stock because of what it called “poor crisis management”. State carrier Air China’s,  near-30% stake in Cathay is smaller than that owned by conglomerate Swire Pacific, but Beijing’s sway looks bigger. Chinese broadcaster CCTV disseminated news of Hogg’s departure before it landed officially at the Hong Kong bourse.  New boss Augustus Tang, who resigned as a director at Swire in 2017, arrives at a dicey moment. It’s not obvious why he is better suited to contend either with the unrest in Hong Kong, including airport clashes that caused hundreds of flights to be cancelled this week, or with slower economic growth in the mainland. The airline is also nearing the end of a three-year turnaround plan that depends on growing revenue. Cathay’s cargo division has been battered by the U.S.-China trade war and the protests have hit forward bookings.  The apparent exertion of boardroom influence means that the idea of Air China taking over Cathay is also no longer unthinkable. And other big companies in the former British colony, including HSBC  and Jardine Matheson, will be on high alert about their dealings with Beijing. If there were any lingering doubt before about the influence of government officials, there can be none left now.    Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The sudden departure signals growing pressure on the corporate sector in the Chinese-controlled former British colony, home to multinationals such as HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) and Jardine Matheson Holdings (JARD.SI), to support Beijing.  Cathay Pacific, which has already terminated two pilots for engaging in illegal protests at the behest of the Chinese aviation regulator, named Augustus Tang as its new CEO.  Tang is the head of Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company - which like Cathay is managed by Swire Pacific Ltd (0019.HK).  The airline also said Paul Loo had resigned as chief customer and commercial officer, to be replaced by the head of its low-cost arm Hong Kong Express, Ronald Lam.   Cathay Chairman John Slosar said recent events had called into question Cathay’s commitment to flight safety and security and put its reputation and brand under pressure.  “This is regrettable as we have always made safety and security our highest priority,” he said in a statement. “We therefore think it is time to put a new management team in place who can reset confidence and lead the airline to new heights.”  Cathay whose strong British links make it a symbol of Hong Kong’s colonial past, has emerged as the highest-profile corporate target as Beijing looks to quell protests in the territory that have gone on for 10 straight weeks.  Hogg, who is British and was appointed CEO in May 2017, said it was right for Loo and him to take responsibility as leaders of the company.  “This is a grave and critical time for our airlines,” Hogg said in an email to staff on Friday evening seen by Reuters. “There is no doubt that our brand and reputation are under immense pressure and this pressure has been growing for some weeks, particularly in the all-important market of mainland China.”  He said in hindsight, he and Loo could have managed the crisis differently, but he did not elaborate in the email.  Hogg’s resignation was first announced by Chinese state television, CCTV. It was unclear, however, if it would help revive the company’s reputation on the mainland.   “The roots are rotten. It doesn’t make a difference no matter who’s leading the company,” a Chinese social media user said on the Twitter-like Weibo platform in a post liked more than 2,000 times.  Cathay has said it is fully committed to Hong Kong under the principle of “One Country, Two Systems” and was confident Hong Kong would have a great future.  “Cathay’s change in management could be a positive in the short term as it provides the company with a ‘clean slate’ so to speak,” BOCOM International analyst Luya You said.   “In the meantime, the focus for Cathay right now is still damage control for its branding. Its reputation among mainland passengers continues to falter, which could lead to more long-lasting damage that is harder and takes longer to rebound from.”   The airline, 30% owned by Air China (601111.SS), became embroiled in crosswinds between Beijing and pro-democracy groups in the Asian financial hub after some of its employees took part in the Hong Kong protests.   Cathay shares plumbed 10-year lows on Tuesday, but rebounded the next day after the airline condemned the protests, vowed to follow Chinese aviation regulations and terminated the employment of two pilots.  Cathay this week canceled 272 flights, affecting more than 55,000 passengers, as its home airport was shutdown by protests.   The carrier is also seeing a drop in forward bookings due to the local unrest, it said last week after swinging to a first-half profit based on a turnaround plan led by Hogg, a highly regarded executive in the aviation industry.  “It is disappointing to learn of his resignation particularly given this current challenging period,” said an analyst, who was not authorized to speak publicly about personnel changes.

(For more Reuters DEALTALKS, click on)  * HK listing likely to raise $10 bln-$15 bln-sources  * Company considering several different timetables-sources  * In talks with HKEX listing group, hasn’t appeared for hearing-sources  By Jennifer Hughes and Julie  Zhu  HONG KONG, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Hong Kong’s political unrest is posing a dilemma for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd on the timing of its planned $15 billion listing in the city, with sources saying China’s biggest e-commerce company is now considering several timetables.  New York-listed Alibaba was most likely to launch the offer - potentially the world’s biggest of the year - as early as the third quarter, sources have said, and late August, after its first-quarter earnings, was widely viewed as the most likely window.  In preparation for the giant offer, bankers advising other large listings in Hong Kong have been careful to avoid planning their launches around that period, fearing that a clash of timing would crowd out their offerings.  But not a word was mentioned by Alibaba on the Hong Kong listing when it released estimate-beating earnings on Thursday nor did the offer come up in the hour-long discussion with analysts after the results.  Two sources involved in the deal and one other briefed on Alibaba’s discussions described the company’s thinking on the deal as “fluid” and said Alibaba was considering several timetables.  Alibaba declined to comment.  The Hong Kong listing deal was estimated at up to $20 billion, but is more likely, according to sources close to the deal, to raise between $10-$15 billion.  The listing was always expected to be a complex affair because of China’s tight control of cross-border share trading, but Hong Kong’s unrest has taken the complexity several notches higher.  More than 10 weeks of confrontations between police and pro-democracy protesters have plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997 and presented President Xi Jinping with his biggest popular challenge since taking power in 2012.  Tear gas has been used frequently by police while more than 700 people have been arrested.  This week protesters effectively closed the city’s airport on two successive days, disrupting tens of thousands of travellers and posing a practical problem to any company considering launching a deal roadshow in Hong Kong.  Under the circumstances, when Alibaba lists becomes crucial as it sends a signal to the rest of the world on the state of Hong Kong as a business and financial centre and provides a window into China’s reading of the situation.  “How do you think Beijing feels about giving Hong Kong a $15 billion gift like this, right now?” asked one capital markets professional not involved in the Alibaba deal.  A listing by Alibaba is a big deal for Hong Kong, which loosened its rules last year specifically to lure overseas-listed Chinese tech giants to list closer to home.  Alibaba would be the first to test the new system.  Asked this week whether Hong Kong’s turmoil would affect its listing, Hong Kong stock exchange chief executive Charles Li avoided directly acknowledging the company’s application, which is still technically confidential.  But Li added: “I am confident that companies like that ultimately will find a home here, because this is home and I think they will come. I don’t know when though.”  Alibaba’s Hong Kong listing is also sensitive for China, which has been working to give mainland investors a bigger role in funding the country’s fast-growing tech sector.  Officials are conscious that capital controls and the U.S. listing preference of most of China’s first-generation tech giants mean that international shareholders have profited far more from their success than local investors. Mainland investors can buy Hong Kong shares through the so-called Stock Connect, which allows investors in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong to trade shares listed on each others’ exchanges.  But the inclusion of Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares in the Stock Connect is not guaranteed because the scheme does not yet allow mainland buying of companies which have weighted their voting rights in favour of founders, such as smartphone maker Xiaomi and Meituan Dianping, the online food delivery-to-ticketing firm. Both took advantage last year of another Hong Kong rule change to float in Hong Kong with weighted voting rights structures.  While Alibaba has a single class of shares with equal votes, its governance is not considered standard since its board is controlled by a self-selecting group of company insiders.  Chinese regulators have said they will allow local investors to trade companies with weighted voting rights, but have not yet set a date for doing so.  Alibaba’s deal must also overcome one other technical hurdle: it must gain the approval of the city’s listing committee, a 27-strong independent group of industry professionals whose consent is needed for all first-time share sales.  The company has been in discussions with the committee but has not yet appeared before the group at one of its regular Thursday hearings for formal approval, according to three sources.  So far only Credit Suisse and CICC, the Chinese investment bank, have been mandated for the mega-listing, sources said, although several other banks are jockeying for a role on the deal, they added.  All are expected to be urging caution on the listing given the size of the deal and the political and market considerations.  One senior banker not involved said it made no sense to move too quickly. 	Reuters
580	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N25C22Y	August 16, 2019 /  9:01 AM / in 8 months	Special Report: Rudderless rebellion - Inside the Hong Kong protesters' anarchic campaign against China	HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ah Lung spends his days working as a clerk for a Hong Kong shipping firm. At night, he dons a mask, black helmet and body armor, and heads out into the streets to face off against the city’s riot police.  The 25-year-old activist has been a constant presence at the often violent protests that have rocked Hong Kong this summer, rallying comrades, building barricades and rushing from district to district in a frantic game of cat-and-mouse with police.  Ah Lung, who would only identify himself by his nickname, which means “dragon” in Cantonese, is representative of a growing number of discontented young Hong Kongers who are fueling a protest movement that, unlike its predecessors, is taking aim directly at Beijing.  It is a movement without clearly discernible leaders or structure, making it difficult for the authorities to effectively target — and increasingly hard for the protesters themselves to manage.   While it has the support of established pro-democracy groups, the amorphous movement is fueled by activists like Ah Lung – young Hong Kongers who operate independently or in small groups and adapt their tactics on the run.  “We’re not so organized,” Ah Lung said. “Every day changes, and we see what the police and the government do, then we take action.”  “My dream is to revive Hong Kong, to bring a revolution in our time,” Ah Lung said. “This is the meaning of my life now.”  Through interviews with dozens of protesters like Ah Lung and reporting from dozens of protests, Reuters has pieced together a picture of how this movement functions and the mindset driving it.  The protests, which started as a peaceful rebuke of the Hong Kong government back in April, have evolved into a direct challenge to Communist Party rule over this former British colony.   With slogans such as “Free Hong Kong” and “Hong Kong is not China,” Ah Lung and his fellow protesters have made clear they reject a future in which Hong Kong is inexorably absorbed into the mainland giant, eventually becoming just another Chinese city.  Protesters are provocatively calling the demonstrations an “era of revolution,” a formulation that has infuriated a ruling Chinese Communist Party determined to crush any challenge to its monopoly on power.  Scenes once unthinkable in Hong Kong are now commonplace: The city’s international airport being shut down this week after a prolonged occupation by protesters; a Chinese official publicly suggesting that aspects of some of the protests were terrorism; the legislature stormed and ransacked by protesters; police officers repeatedly baton-charging crowds of protesters and unleashing torrents of tear gas in famed shopping districts.  On Tuesday, protesters who managed to shut down the airport also attacked a Chinese man for being a suspected undercover agent. He was identified as a reporter for the Global Times, a tabloid controlled by Beijing, highlighting how activists are making the Chinese government the target of their protests.   It also brought another issue into focus: the risks of waging a  leaderless rebellion. Demonstrators later apologized for the disruptions at the airport, apparently concerned that their chaotic protests might alienate broader sections of the Hong Kong public who had been supporting them.  “The movement has a large degree of self-restraint and solidarity, but of course that’s very conditional,” said Samson Yuen, a political scientist at Lingnan University in Hong Kong who has conducted surveys of protesters to understand their motives and support base.   “If certain actions spin out of control, if say someone dies from it, then that might be a game-changer.”  ONE-COUNTRY, TWO-SYSTEMS  Under the “one-country, two-systems” formula, China promised Hong Kong it would enjoy autonomy for 50 years after its handover from Britain in 1997.   Unlike those who negotiated the deal, for young protesters born after the handover that deadline will fall in the middle of their lives. And, as Beijing tightens its grip on Hong Kong, the future they see careening toward them is that of an authoritarian mainland China with curbs on the freedoms and rights they now enjoy.  “In 2047, if it returns to China, real Hong Kongers will leave and emigrate from Hong Kong,” said Ah Lung, speaking in a small apartment in the Sham Shui Po neighborhood as he prepared for a night of protests that quickly descended into violence.  “By then, it won’t be Hong Kong anymore, but Xiang Gang,” he said, referring to the name commonly used on the mainland for Hong Kong.  Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has said that protesters’ calls for a revolution to “liberate” Hong Kong are illegal acts that challenge the authority of the central government in Beijing.   In response to questions from Reuters about the protests, a spokesman for Lam referred to her promise to address income disparities in the city once the violence subsides.  The Hong Kong Liaison Office, Beijing’s main representative arm in the city, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond to questions from Reuters.  The Hong Kong police did not respond to questions from Reuters. During the protests, police spokesmen have repeatedly defended the use of force and have pointed to escalating violence by protesters that has included throwing bricks and fire bombs.  The protesters’ mantra – “Be water!” – epitomizes the movement’s tactics. A phrase borrowed from the Hong Kong movie star Bruce Lee, who used it to describe his kung fu philosophy, it is a call for flexibility and creativity, moving forward to press an advantage and pulling back when a strategic retreat is needed.  Its latest manifestation is the series of wildcat protests that have spread across the city in recent weeks. When police turn up in numbers at one protest, the activists often engage them, tying down officers before melting away and reappearing to stage a fresh protest in another area.  Pro-democracy protests that paralyzed much of downtown Hong Kong in 2014 involved blocking several key roads for more than two months. The more fluid tactics now being deployed by protesters, often masked to avoid surveillance and dressed in black, present a greater challenge for the police. Frontline officers speak of exhaustion, saying they never know where the activists will strike next.  Protesters say their movement is leaderless. In some ways, that’s a reaction to the 2014 demonstrations in which many of the leaders were arrested and given prison terms.   Unlike those protests, when leaders like Joshua Wong became globally recognized names, frontline activists like Ah Lung are deliberately staying under the radar, using pseudonyms and appearing at protests with their faces obscured by masks and sunglasses.  The leaderless nature of the protest movement is made possible, to a large extent, by social media.  Protesters take their cues from more than 100 groups on the instant messaging app Telegram, dozens of Instagram sites and online forums like LIHKG. The groups are used to post everything from news on upcoming protests to tips on dousing tear gas canisters fired by the police to the identities of suspected undercover police and the access codes to buildings in Hong Kong where protesters can hide.  It’s not an issue of having “no leader, it simply means that everyone is a leader,” said one 22-year-old Hong Kong student based in Britain who helps run “antielabhk,” an Instagram page that includes details about protests that has amassed more than 50,000 followers. The student asked not to be named.  Ma, a 28-year-old university student who would only give her surname, said at a recent protest in the volatile Mongkok district that she had come after seeing recruitment appeals in a Telegram group. “We were only notified or briefed today – like an hour ago,” said Ma, as she handed out water to protesters.  A feature of the protests in recent weeks has been the sight of ordinary activists like Ah Lung, the shipping clerk, rallying other protesters.  In Sham Shui Po on Sunday, Ah Lung joined other masked “frontliners” as the protest began. Some used wrenches to loosen bolts on roadside fences, which were then shaken loose, bound with nylon ties, and formed into makeshift barricades against the police.   Ah Lung, brandishing a Star Wars light saber he had bought at a toy shop, called out instructions on where to position the barricades. As they worked, other masked protesters used hand-held telescopes to track police movements.  The improvised, bottom-up nature of the protest movement is further evident in the scores of medics, some of them medical staff from local hospitals, who say they have turned up unprompted at protest sites to treat the wounded and administer saline solution to tear gas victims.  Kay, a 28-year-old medic who works in information technology and would only give her first name, said she prepared an emergency kit, including  iodine, bandages, tourniquets and saline solution before every protest.   “I was hit by a tear gas canister one time and then when I retreated to a safe spot, some people helped me. I felt touched, and I wanted to help some people back.”  While the protest movement may not have clearly identifiable leaders, it does have the backing of prominent pro-democracy activists and groups who have organized some of the demonstrations. In the past, they have led smaller, more orderly demonstrations that were not aimed so pointedly at the leadership in Beijing.  Reuters reporting shows there is a high degree of coordination among a small circle of these activists, many of whom participated in the 2014 protests that were sparked by Beijing’s refusal to grant Hong Kong universal suffrage.  For instance, members of Demosisto, a party that advocates for greater democracy in Hong Kong, have been behind a number of demonstrations, some of which ended in violent clashes with riot police, according to the group’s members.  Last month, Tobias Leung, a member of the party’s standing committee, applied for police permission to stage a rally in the suburban district of Sha Tin. Leung’s link to the protest wasn’t immediately clear because he applied under the name of a local community group, according to Wong, the leader of Demosisto.  Wong and other prominent activists have been present at various demonstrations, sometimes close to the front lines. But they have struggled to impose leadership on the streets, with the protesters debating amongst themselves and consulting their phone groups on what action to take.  Along with other prominent democrats in the city, Wong has been seen at protests by Reuters being shouted down by activists who say they don’t want the movement hijacked by any single leader or group.  “I’m quite happy people are saying we should not rely on any specific political leader to lead this movement,” Wong told Reuters.   Jailed independence activist Edward Leung, who is revered by many of the protesters, is currently serving a six-year sentence for rioting stemming from a protest in 2016.  Francis Lee, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who has written a book on Hong Kong social movements, describes the protests as an “open source” movement. Protesters often aggregate the best ideas in online groups and vote on courses of action, he said.  China has accused foreign countries of being behind the protests. Both Western and Asian diplomats in the city monitor the protests closely and some have been seen at events. Diplomats say this is part of their routine work.   The protests erupted in late April over a bill proposed by Lam that would have allowed the extradition of defendants from Hong Kong to mainland China. Unlike the demand for universal suffrage, which fueled the 2014 protests, the extradition bill was seen as a specific, tangible threat by many Hong Kongers, galvanizing hundreds of thousands of people.      Facing huge protests, Lam announced on June 15 that she was freezing the bill.   That wasn’t enough for many Hong Kong residents, many of whom flooded onto the streets in one of the largest protest marches ever seen in the city, largely organized by a coalition of civil society groups. The march brought together a diverse cross-section of Hong Kong society, including members of the city’s politically conservative middle class.  A major turning point in the protests was an assault on July 21 on Beijing’s Central Government Liaison Office – the most prominent symbol of China’s authority in Hong Kong.   Black-clad activists arrived at dusk at the glass-steel skyscraper that bears the red state seal of China above its entrance. As the crowd quickly swelled to thousands, some protesters hurled eggs at the building. Others used spray paint to scrawl the words “Revolution of Our Time” on the walls.  Some tried to neutralize surveillance cameras by targeting them with laser pointers. To roars of approval, protesters then lobbed black paint at the state seal of China.  “Carrie Lam has refused to listen to our concerns about Communist Party interference,” said one 27-year-old protester who would only give his name as Paul, as he attached vials of anti-tear gas fluid onto his military style backpack. “Now we have to send our message to the communists directly.”  The Liaison Office has since become the target of repeated protests.  Nick Tsang, a protester clad in a black balaclava and black clothes, was in a crowd that began congregating in a Hong Kong park on the afternoon of July 28.   Tsang checked out a Telegram group to see where other protesters were going. One group of protesters splintered off and headed to the city’s police headquarters, while another group branched out in the direction of the Causeway Bay shopping district. Later on, some backtracked toward the Liaison Office. Tsang followed them.  This time, the building was fortified with water-filled plastic barriers, and several battalions of riot police and other elite units. Liaison Office staff, meanwhile, had replaced the sullied state seal with a new one and encased it in a plexiglass box.  Following several hours of heated clashes in the streets around the Liaison Office, a rearguard of protesters, including Tsang, found themselves surrounded by police. With tear gas swirling, they made a run for the Hong Kong subway system and escaped onto a train.  “We can’t retreat or the authoritarianism will worsen,” said Tsang, referring to the Chinese government.  “This is not about me. This is for Hong Kong, my home city.”  (Multimedia package on Hong Kong protests : here) 	Reuters

He was identified as a reporter for the Global Times, a tabloid controlled by Beijing, highlighting how activists are making the Chinese government the target of their protests.  It also brought another issue into focus: the risks of waging a  leaderless rebellion. Demonstrators later apologized for the disruptions at the airport, apparently concerned that their chaotic protests might alienate broader sections of the Hong Kong public who had been supporting them.  “The movement has a large degree of self-restraint and solidarity, but of course that’s very conditional,” said Samson Yuen, a political scientist at Lingnan University in Hong Kong who has conducted surveys of protesters to understand their motives and support base.  “If certain actions spin out of control, if say someone dies from it, then that might be a game-changer.”  ONE-COUNTRY, TWO-SYSTEMS  Under the “one-country, two-systems” formula, China promised Hong Kong it would enjoy autonomy for 50 years after its handover from Britain in 1997.  Unlike those who negotiated the deal, for young protesters born after the handover that deadline will fall in the middle of their lives. And, as Beijing tightens its grip on Hong Kong, the future they see careening towards them is that of an authoritarian mainland China with curbs on the freedoms and rights they now enjoy.  “In 2047, if it returns to China, real Hong Kongers will leave and emigrate from Hong Kong,” said Ah Lung, speaking in a small apartment in the Sham Shui Po neighborhood as he prepared for a night of protests that quickly descended into violence.  “By then, it won’t be Hong Kong anymore, but Xiang Gang,” he said, referring to the name commonly used on the mainland for Hong Kong.  Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has said that protesters’ calls for a revolution to “liberate” Hong Kong are illegal acts that challenge the authority of the central government in Beijing.  In response to questions from Reuters about the protests, a spokesman for Lam referred to her promise to address income disparities in the city once the violence subsides.  The Hong Kong Liaison Office, Beijing’s main representative arm in the city, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond to questions from Reuters.  The Hong Kong police did not respond to questions from Reuters. During the protests, police spokesmen have repeatedly defended the use of force and have pointed to escalating violence by protesters that has included throwing bricks and fire bombs.  The protesters’ mantra – “Be water!” – epitomizes the movement’s tactics. A phrase borrowed from the Hong Kong movie star Bruce Lee, who used it to describe his kung fu philosophy, it is a call for flexibility and creativity, moving forward to press an advantage and pulling back when a strategic retreat is needed.  Its latest manifestation is the series of wildcat protests that have spread across the city in recent weeks. When police turn up in numbers at one protest, the activists often engage them, tying down officers before melting away and reappearing to stage a fresh protest in another area.  Pro-democracy protests that paralyzed much of downtown Hong Kong in 2014 involved blocking several key roads for more than two months. The more fluid tactics now being deployed by protesters, often masked to avoid surveillance and dressed in black, present a greater challenge for the police. Frontline officers speak of exhaustion, saying they never know where the activists will strike next.  Protesters say their movement is leaderless. In some ways, that’s a reaction to the 2014 demonstrations in which many of the leaders were arrested and given prison terms.  Unlike those protests, when leaders like Joshua Wong became globally recognized names, frontline activists like Ah Lung are deliberately staying under the radar, using pseudonyms and appearing at protests with their faces obscured by masks and sunglasses.  The leaderless nature of the protest movement is made possible, to a large extent, by social media.  Protesters take their cues from more than 100 groups on the instant messaging app Telegram, dozens of Instagram sites and online forums like LIHKG. The groups are used to post everything from news on upcoming protests to tips on dousing tear gas canisters fired by the police to the identities of suspected undercover police and the access codes to buildings in Hong Kong where protesters can hide.  It’s not an issue of having “no leader, it simply means that everyone is a leader,” said one 22-year-old Hong Kong student based in Britain who helps run “antielabhk,” an Instagram page that includes details about protests that has amassed more than 50,000 followers. The student asked not to be named.  Ma, a 28-year-old university student who would only give her surname, said at a recent protest in the volatile Mongkok district that she had come after seeing recruitment appeals in a Telegram group. “We were only notified or briefed today – like an hour ago,” said Ma, as she handed out water to protesters.  A feature of the protests in recent weeks has been the sight of ordinary activists like Ah Lung, the shipping clerk, rallying other protesters.  In Sham Shui Po on Sunday, Ah Lung joined other masked “frontliners” as the protest began. Some used wrenches to loosen bolts on roadside fences, which were then shaken loose, bound with nylon ties, and formed into makeshift barricades against the police.  Ah Lung, brandishing a Star Wars light saber he had bought at a toy shop, called out instructions on where to position the barricades. As they worked, other masked protesters used hand-held telescopes to track police movements.  The improvised, bottom-up nature of the protest movement is further evident in the scores of medics, some of them medical staff from local hospitals, who say they have turned up unprompted at protest sites to treat the wounded and administer saline solution to tear gas victims.  Kay, a 28-year-old medic who works in information technology and would only give her first name, said she prepared an emergency kit, including  iodine, bandages, tourniquets and saline solution before every protest.  “I was hit by a tear gas canister one time and then when I retreated to a safe spot, some people helped me. I felt touched, and I wanted to help some people back.”  While the protest movement may not have clearly identifiable leaders, it does have the backing of prominent pro-democracy activists and groups who have organized some of the demonstrations. In the past, they have led smaller, more orderly demonstrations that were not aimed so pointedly at the leadership in Beijing.  Reuters reporting shows there is a high degree of coordination among a small circle of these activists, many of whom participated in the 2014 protests that were sparked by Beijing’s refusal to grant Hong Kong universal suffrage.  For instance, members of Demosisto, a party that advocates for greater democracy in Hong Kong, have been behind a number of demonstrations, some of which ended in violent clashes with riot police, according to the group’s members.  Last month, Tobias Leung, a member of the party’s standing committee, applied for police permission to stage a rally in the suburban district of Sha Tin. Leung’s link to the protest wasn’t immediately clear because he applied under the name of a local community group, according to Wong, the leader of Demosisto.  Wong and other prominent activists have been present at various demonstrations, sometimes close to the front lines. But they have struggled to impose leadership on the streets, with the protesters debating amongst themselves and consulting their phone groups on what action to take.  Along with other prominent democrats in the city, Wong has been seen at protests by Reuters being shouted down by activists who say they don’t want the movement hijacked by any single leader or group.  “I’m quite happy people are saying we should not rely on any specific political leader to lead this movement,” Wong told Reuters.  Jailed independence activist Edward Leung, who is revered by many of the protesters, is currently serving a six-year sentence for rioting stemming from a protest in 2016.  Francis Lee, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who has written a book on Hong Kong social movements, describes the protests as an “open source” movement. Protesters often aggregate the best ideas in online groups and vote on courses of action, he said.  China has accused foreign countries of being behind the protests. Both Western and Asian diplomats in the city monitor the protests closely and some have been seen at events. Diplomats say this is part of their routine work.  The protests erupted in late April over a bill proposed by Lam that would have allowed the extradition of defendants from Hong Kong to mainland China. Unlike the demand for universal suffrage, which fueled the 2014 protests, the extradition bill was seen as a specific, tangible threat by many Hong Kongers, galvanizing hundreds of thousands of people.  Facing huge protests, Lam announced on June 15 that she was freezing the bill.  That wasn’t enough for many Hong Kong residents, many of whom flooded onto the streets in one of the largest protest marches ever seen in the city, largely organized by a coalition of civil society groups. The march brought together a diverse cross-section of Hong Kong society, including members of the city’s politically conservative middle class.  A major turning point in the protests was an assault on July 21 on Beijing’s Central Government Liaison Office – the most prominent symbol of China’s authority in Hong Kong.  Black-clad activists arrived at dusk at the glass-steel skyscraper that bears the red state seal of China above its entrance. As the crowd quickly swelled to thousands, some protesters hurled eggs at the building. Others used spray paint to scrawl the words “Revolution of Our Time” on the walls.  Some tried to neutralize surveillance cameras by targeting them with laser pointers. To roars of approval, protesters then lobbed black paint at the state seal of China.  “Carrie Lam has refused to listen to our concerns about Communist Party interference,” said one 27-year-old protester who would only give his name as Paul, as he attached vials of anti-tear gas fluid onto his military style backpack. “Now we have to send our message to the communists directly.”  The Liaison Office has since become the target of repeated protests.  Nick Tsang, a protester clad in a black balaclava and black clothes, was in a crowd that began congregating in a Hong Kong park on the afternoon of July 28.  Tsang checked out a Telegram group to see where other protesters were going. One group of protesters splintered off and headed to the city’s police headquarters, while another group branched out in the direction of the Causeway Bay shopping district. Later on, some backtracked towards the Liaison Office. Tsang followed them.  This time, the building was fortified with water-filled plastic barriers, and several battalions of riot police and other elite units. Liaison Office staff, meanwhile, had replaced the sullied state seal with a new one and encased it in a plexiglass box.  Following several hours of heated clashes in the streets around the Liaison Office, a rearguard of protesters, including Tsang, found themselves surrounded by police. With tear gas swirling, they made a run for the Hong Kong subway system and escaped onto a train.  “We can’t retreat or the authoritarianism will worsen,” said Tsang, referring to the Chinese government.

The greenback was on course for a weekly gain against safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, pointing to some respite for frayed nerves after fears of recession and protests in Hong Kong rattled financial markets.  During Asian trading the dollar briefly extended gains and the yen fell as Japanese stocks erased early losses to trade higher and as U.S. Treasury yields rose slightly. The move quickly faded, however, partly reflecting thin treading due to the summer holiday season.  Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar index edged higher to 98.218. Since hitting a three-week low on Aug. 9, the dollar index has recovered, rising around 1%.  Data showing American consumers continued to splurge in July came as a relief to investors after the U.S. bond market sounded alarms of a recession.  Yet, the fragile calm in markets is unlikely to last, traders said.  This week’s inversion in the U.S. Treasury yield curve, which has historically preceded several past U.S. recessions, has stoked fresh worries about the economic impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war.  China on Thursday vowed to counter the latest U.S. tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods, but U.S. President Donald Trump said any pact would have to be on America’s terms, suggesting a resolution to the trade war remains elusive.  Trump, who is seeking re-election in 2020 and had made the economy and his tough stance on China a key part of his 2016 campaign for the White House, said any agreement must meet U.S. demands.  More protests are also expected in Hong Kong over the weekend, which could become a new geopolitical flashpoint and further complicate the U.S.-China trade war.  Ten weeks of clashes between police and pro-democracy protesters, angered by a perceived erosion of freedoms, have plunged the Asian financial hub into its worst crisis since it came under Chinese rule from Britain in 1997.  “The most important point is there are more signs of a global economic slowdown,” said Tsutomu Soma, general manager of fixed income business solutions at SBI Securities in Tokyo.  “Rates will continue to fall, and investors will pull back from risk, which means money will leave emerging markets and go to Treasuries, the Swiss franc, gold, and the yen.”  The dollar was little changed at 106.18 yen in Asian trading after rising 0.2% on Thursday.  For the week, the greenback was up 0.5% against the Japanese currency, its biggest gain since the week ended July 26.  The dollar rose 0.3% to 0.9787 Swiss franc,, on course for a 0.6% weekly gain.  A day after inverting, the U.S. yield curve steepened a little. Curve inversion, which occurs when long-term yields dip below short-term yields.  Sterling was marginally higher, on course for its first weekly gain since mid-July, as positive data on retail sales and consumer pries showed the British economy is in better shape than some investors had feared.  The pound traded at $1.2088, close to a one-week high of $1.2150. 	Reuters

Hundreds of China’s People’s Armed Police (PAP) on Thursday conducted exercises at a sports stadium in Shenzhen that borders Hong Kong a day after the U.S. State Department said it was “deeply concerned” about the movements, which have prompted worries that the troops could be used to break up protests.  Trump told reporters on Thursday he did not want to see a resort to violence to quell the protests in Hong Kong and reiterated that he wanted to see China “humanely solve the problem.”  “I am concerned. I wouldn’t want to see a violent crackdown,” Trump said, speaking in Morristown, New Jersey. “If he (Xi) sat down with the protesters - a group of representative protesters - I’d bet he’d work it out in 15 minutes. ... I know it’s not the kind of thing he does, but I think it wouldn’t be a bad idea.”  Trump said he had a call with Xi scheduled “soon.”  Ten weeks of confrontations between police and protesters have plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis since it reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997, and have presented the biggest popular challenge to Xi in his seven years in power.  The Civil Human Rights Front, which organized million-strong marches in June, has scheduled another protest for Sunday.  China’s ambassador to London warned that Beijing could use its power to quell the Hong Kong protests if the situation deteriorated further and repeating charges that some protesters had shown “signs of terrorism.”  “The central government will not sit on its hands and watch,” the ambassador, Liu Xiaoming, told reporters. “We have enough solutions and enough power within the limits of (the) Basic Law to quell any unrest swiftly,” Liu said, referring to Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, which states that the Hong Kong government can ask the Chinese garrison in the city to help maintain order.  “The central government of China will never allow a few violent offenders to drag Hong Kong down a dangerous road, down a dangerous abyss,” Liu said.   The Friday edition of China’s state-controlled Global Times tabloid also warned that China had the option to “forcefully intervene” and lashed out at what Beijing describes as U.S. interference in Hong Kong.  “If Hong Kong cannot restore the rule of law on its own and the riots intensify, it’s imperative then for the central government to take direct actions based on the Basic Law,” it said, saying the Shenzhen PAP deployment was “a clear warning.”  The paper said the situation in Hong Kong “won’t be a repeat of the June 4th political incident in 1989,” referring to the bloody military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square 30 years ago.  White House national security adviser John Bolton warned against a repeat of Tiananmen in an interview on Wednesday.  On Wednesday, Trump tied a U.S. trade deal with China to a humane resolution of the protests.  Trump has been seeking a major deal to correct trade imbalances with China ahead of his 2020 re-election bid and has faced criticism from Congress and elsewhere for not taking a stronger public line on Hong Kong and for his characterization of the protests earlier this month as “riots” that were a matter for China to deal with.  Trump’s tougher stance on Hong Kong followed a debate within his administration over whether Washington was looking too compliant while China appeared to be preparing for a crackdown, a source familiar with the deliberations said.  On Thursday, China’s Foreign Ministry said Beijing had noted Trump’s comment that Beijing needed to resolve the Hong Kong crisis on its own.  Western governments have stepped up calls for restraint following chaotic scenes at Hong Kong’s airport this week that forced cancellation of nearly 1,000 flights and saw protesters set upon two men they suspected of being government sympathizers.  France called on city officials to renew talks with activists, while Canada said China should handle the protests with tact.  Two opposition lawmakers from Hong Kong visiting the United States on Thursday urged the outside world to stay focused on developments.  “For the international community to speak up for Hong Kong is extremely important, and we see that across the American political establishment,” Dennis Kwok of the liberal-democratic Civic Party said at the Asia Society thinktank in New York. He and fellow party member Alvin Yeung were to meet with U.S. lawmakers.  The airport, one of the world’s busiest, was returning to normal on Thursday but under tight security after thousands of protesters jammed its halls on Monday and Tuesday nights.  Late on Wednesday night, police and protesters faced off again on the streets, with riot officers quickly firing tear gas.   Seventeen people were arrested on Wednesday, bringing the total detained since June to 748, police told a news conference, adding that police stations have been surrounded and attacked 76 times during the crisis.  Despite the Shenzhen deployments, several Western and Asian diplomats in Hong Kong said they believed China had little appetite for putting its forces onto Hong Kong’s streets, and    a U.S. official said on Wednesday the PAP activities appeared aimed at intimidating the protesters.  The U.S. State Department warned on Wednesday that continued erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy put at risk the preferential economic status it enjoys under U.S. law and leading members of the U.S. Congress have warned that a crackdown could be met by U.S. sanctions.  Research firm Capital Economics said the protests could push Hong Kong into a recession and risked “an even worse outcome if a further escalation triggers capital flight.” Hong Kong’s property market, one of the world’s most expensive, would be hit hard in that scenario, it added.  Financial Secretary Paul Chan unveiled a series of measures worth HK$19.1 billion ($2.44 billion) on Thursday to tackle economic headwinds, but he said it was not related to political pressure from the protests.   Some business and citizens’ groups have posted newspaper advertisements backing Hong Kong’s government.  The head of Macau casino operator Galaxy Entertainment (0027.HK), Lui Che-woo, urged talks to restore harmony. The protests have affected the neighboring Chinese territory of Macau, with some visitors avoiding the world’s biggest gambling hub amid transport disruptions and safety concerns.  	Reuters

585	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1V51LR	August 15, 2019 /  2:17 PM / 8 months ago	Trump urges China's Xi to meet Hong Kong protesters	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday urged Chinese President Xi Jinping to meet personally with the protesters in Hong Kong, saying it would lead to an end to tensions that have seized the territory for weeks.  “If President Xi would meet directly and personally with the protesters, there would be a happy and enlightened ending to the Hong Kong problem. I have no doubt!” Trump tweeted.  Trump’s tweet came a day after he tied a U.S. trade deal with China to a humane resolution of the weeks of protests wracking Hong Kong. He made that comment hours after the State Department said it was “deeply concerned” about reports of movement of Chinese paramilitary forces along the Hong Kong border.  Trump, who has been seeking a major deal to correct trade imbalances with China ahead of his 2020 re-election bid, has faced criticism from Congress and elsewhere for not taking a stronger public line on Hong Kong and for his characterization of the protests earlier this month as “riots” that were a matter for China to deal with.  His apparently tougher stance on Wednesday followed an internal debate within the White House and State Department over whether the United States was looking too compliant as the Chinese appeared to be preparing for a crackdown.  A source familiar with the deliberations, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that while an even-handed approach was smart, it was not the right signal to send in this case.  A statement from China’s foreign ministry on Thursday said Beijing had noted Trump’s comment that Beijing needs to resolve the crisis in Hong Kong on its own.  Trump said last month that Xi had acted “very responsibly” in dealing with the protests. The Financial Times newspaper reported earlier in July that the U.S. president had agreed with Xi at the Group of 20 summit in June to tone down criticism of China’s handling of the crisis.  On Wednesday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross appeared to back this approach in a CNBC interview.  “The president has made clear that he is watching very carefully what’s happening,” Ross said. “The question of it is what role is there for the U.S. in that manner? This is an internal matter.”  White House national security adviser John Bolton told the Voice of America later on Wednesday he understood the mood in Congress was “very volatile” with regard to the Hong Kong issue, and warned that “a misstep by the Chinese government, I think, would cause an explosion on Capitol Hill.”  The State Department warned on Wednesday that continued erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy put at risk the preferential economic status it enjoys under U.S. law.  Bolton said around 60 percent of investment into mainland China went through Hong Kong, because of the former British colony’s trustworthy judicial system.  “If Hong Kong loses that reputation because of a bad decision by the Chinese government, they’ll have significant economic consequences in China this time,” he said, adding that Americans still remembered Tiananmen Square in 1989.”They remember the picture of the man standing in front of the line of tanks, they remember the statue of Lady Liberty, they remember voices of the Chinese people asking for freedom and democracy, and they remember the repression of the Chinese government in 1989,” he said.  “It would be a big mistake to create a new memory like that in Hong Kong.” 	Reuters

Western governments, including the United States, have stepped up calls for restraint, following ugly and chaotic scenes at the city’s airport this week, which forced the cancellation of nearly 1,000 flights and saw protesters set upon two men they suspected of being government sympathisers.  The airport, one of the world’s busiest, was returning to normal but under tight security after thousands of protesters had jammed its halls on Monday and Tuesday nights, part of a protest movement Beijing has likened to terrorism.  Across a bridge linking Hong Kong’s rural hinterland with the booming mainland city of Shenzhen, hundreds of members of the paramilitary People’s Armed Police conducted exercises at a sports complex in what was widely seen as a warning to protesters in Hong Kong.  The police could be seen carrying out crowd-control exercises, and more than 100 dark-painted paramilitary vehicles filled the stadium’s parking lots.  Chinese state media had first reported on the exercises on Monday, prompting U.S. concerns they could be used to break up the protests. However, several western and Asian diplomats in Hong Kong told Reuters Beijing has little appetite for putting the PAP or the People’s Liberation Army onto Hong Kong’s streets.  Ten weeks of increasingly violent confrontations between police and protesters have plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis since it reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997, and police tactics have been toughening.  The protests represent the biggest populist challenge for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012 and show no immediate signs of abating.  Late on Wednesday night, police and protesters faced off again on the streets of the financial hub, with riot officers quickly firing tear gas.  Seventeen people were arrested on Wednesday, bringing the total detained since June to 748, police told a news conference, adding that police stations have been surrounded and attacked 76 times during the crisis.  U.S. President Donald Trump tied a U.S.-China trade deal to Beijing resolving the unrest “humanely”, and suggested he was willing to meet Xi to discuss the crisis.  “I have ZERO doubt that if President Xi (Jinping) wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem, he can do it. Personal meeting?” Trump said on Twitter.  The U.S. State Department said it was deeply concerned over reports that Chinese police forces were gathering near the border with Hong Kong and urged the city’s government to respect freedom of speech.  It also issued a travel advisory urging U.S. citizens to exercise caution in Hong Kong. China has frequently warned against what it regards as outside interference in an internal issue.  Other foreign governments urged calm. France called on city officials to renew talks with activists, while Canada said China should handle the protests with tact.  The Civil Human Rights Front, which organised million-strong marches in June, has scheduled another protest for Sunday.  The protesters have five demands, including the complete withdrawal of a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent for trial in mainland Chinese courts.  Opposition to the extradition bill has developed into wider concerns about the erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula put in place after Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule in 1997.  It was not yet clear whether the airport clashes had eroded the broad support the movement has so far attracted in Hong Kong, despite adding to the city’s faltering economy.  The protests could push Hong Kong into a recession, research firm Capital Economics said, and risked “an even worse outcome if a further escalation triggers capital flight”.  Hong Kong’s property market, one of the world’s most expensive, would be hit hard in that scenario, it added.  Financial Secretary Paul Chan unveiled a series of measures worth HK$19.1 billion ($2.44 billion) on Thursday to tackle economic headwinds, but he said it was not related to political pressure from the protests.  Business and citizens’ groups have been posting full-page newspaper advertisements that denounce the violence and back Hong Kong’s government. 	Reuters

They have also presented the biggest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping in his seven years in power.  China’s ambassador accused unidentified foreign forces of fomenting violent protests in Hong Kong, warning them that their “conniving” efforts had been noticed and that they would end up damaging themselves.  “Foreign forces must stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs,” he said. “Stop conniving in violent offences - they should not misjudge the situation and go down the wrong path otherwise they will lift the stone only to drop it on their own feet.”  He added: “evidence shows the situation would not have deteriorated so much had it not been for the interference and incitement of foreign forces. Hong Kong is part of China. No foreign country should interfere in Hong Kong’s internal affairs.”   Liu also accused Western media of being unbalanced in their reporting and of confusing right and wrong.  	Reuters

The United States said it was “deeply concerned” at news of Chinese paramilitary police movement near the border, urged Hong Kong’s government to respect freedom of speech, and issued a travel advisory urging caution when visiting the city.    By nightfall, police and protesters were again facing off on the streets, with riot officers shooting tear gas almost immediately as their response to demonstrators toughens.  Ten weeks of increasingly violent confrontation between police and protesters have plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis since it reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997.  Flights resumed on Wednesday amid heightened security at Hong Kong airport, one of the world’s busiest. This followed two days of disruptions sparked by protesters swarming the airport, where, late on Tuesday, they detained two men they suspected opposed them.  China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing called the behavior at the airport no different to terrorism and said it must be severely punished.  “We’re deeply sorry about what happened yesterday,” read a banner held up by a group of a few dozen demonstrators in the airport arrivals hall in the morning.  “We were desperate and we made imperfect decisions. Please accept our apologies,” the banner said.  In chaotic scenes that would once have been unthinkable for Hong Kong, a peaceful sit-in at the airport turned violent late on Tuesday as protesters confronted and held a man they believed was an undercover Chinese agent.  Busloads of riot police arrived in response, clashing with furious demonstrators before withdrawing once the man was removed, and leaving the terminal briefly in control of activists who then briefly detained a reporter from China’s Global Times newspaper, a nationalistic tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily.  It was not clear whether the scenes of violence might have eroded the broad support the movement has so far attracted in Hong Kong, a major financial hub. The protests have also hit the city’s faltering economy.  “We promise to reflect and to improve,” protesters said in one message distributed on social media app Telegram.  “Sorry we were too reckless ... we are only afraid of losing your support to the whole movement due to our mistake, and that you give up on fighting.”   There has been little sign of a letup in the protests, which began in opposition to a now-suspended bill that would have allowed the extradition of suspects for trial in mainland China, but have swelled into wider calls for democracy.  Hundreds attended a demonstration in the residential area of Sham Shui Po, where police arrived and quickly used tear gas after protesters pointed lasers at the police station.  China used its strongest language yet after Tuesday’s incidents. The People’s Daily called for “using the sword of the law” to restore order, and mainland social media users lauded the detained reporter as a hero.  The U.S. State Department called for restraint, and a spokeswoman warned that continued erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy put at risk the privileged status it enjoys under U.S. law.  Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that promised wide-ranging freedoms denied to citizens in mainland China, and it enjoys preferential U.S. treatment in trade and economics.   The U.S. spokeswoman reiterated a U.S. call for all sides to refrain from violence and said it was important for the Hong Kong government to respect “freedoms of speech and peaceful assembly” and for Beijing to adhere to its commitments.  Another U.S. official said Beijing had stationed large numbers of paramilitary People’s Armed Police (PAP) “near and further out from Hong Kong,” but there had been no sign they were moving toward the border.  The U.S. official said it appeared to be an effort to intimidate the protesters, but the protests had yet to reach a level that would compel Beijing to send them in.  The Global Times reported on Monday that People’s Armed Police had been assembling in Shenzhen, a city bordering Hong Kong, “in advance of apparent large-scale exercises.”  It cited video it had obtained showing numerous armored personnel carriers (APCs), trucks and other vehicles on expressways heading in the direction of Shenzhen over the weekend. It noted that the role of the PAP was “dealing with rebellions, riots, serious violent and illegal incidents, terrorist attacks and other social security incidents.”  Satellite images made available to Reuters on Wednesday from Maxar Technologies showed dozens of vehicles, including what appeared to be APCs, at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre across from Hong Kong.  On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been seeking a major deal to correct trade imbalances with China, described the Hong Kong situation as “tricky” but said he hoped it would work out for everybody, including China, and “for liberty” without anyone getting hurt or killed.   China has accused the United States of having a hand in the protests and has denied a request for two U.S. Navy warships to visit Hong Kong in the coming weeks, U.S. officials said.  France urged Hong Kong authorities to renew dialogue with protesters to find a peaceful solution.  At Hong Kong airport, which was designed by renowned British architect Norman Foster, blood, debris and signs of the scuffle were scrubbed away during the night, and cleaners and protesters themselves removed anti-government posters from the walls.  Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific Airways (0293.HK) said a total of 272 departures and arrivals had been canceled because of the disturbances, affecting more than 55,000 passengers.  China’s aviation regulator demanded last week that Cathay suspend personnel supporting protests in Hong Kong from staffing flights entering its airspace. On Wednesday, the carrier said it had fired two pilots.  Forward Keys, a flight data firm, said the crisis had driven a 4.7 percent fall in long-haul bookings to Hong Kong between June 16 and Aug. 9 compared with the same period last year.  “I think the local events clearly are having a profound impact, probably in ways that we haven’t necessarily clearly articulated yet,” Charles Li, chief executive of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, told reporters on Wednesday.  Protesters vowed to press on.  “All the people here are very scared,” Ann, a 21-year-old teacher, told Reuters at the airport as she carefully took down anti-government posters, folding them for re-use.  “But we are more scared that we do not have our freedoms anymore, and so that is why we continue our protests,” she said.  “We feel that our ideas are bulletproof.” 	Reuters

596	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1V41FW	August 14, 2019 /  1:54 PM / 8 months ago	Breakingviews - Western luxury brands’ China dilemma will worsen	LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Western luxury is binge-eating humble pie. In the last few days, storied brands - including Swarovski, Versace and Givenchy - have submitted grovelling apologies for offending Chinese sensibilities. With Hong Kong protests against the mainland getting worse, it’s the thin end of a potentially very awkward wedge.  The brands’ decision to bow down to Beijing will be noted by Hong Kong citizens sympathetic to the protesters. But the humility is hardly surprising. Economic reality is a powerful incentive. China accounted for 33% of all luxury goods sold globally last year, according to Bain, and 2018 was the second consecutive year in which the domestic market grew by 20%. Asia provided a third of Versace’s $207 million revenue in the first quarter, and Greater China represented 22% of Coach’s global sales.  Also, the brands got their facts wrong. Swarovski’s website and products by the likes of Givenchy, Coach and Versace have implicitly represented Hong Kong as a country. Foreign executives based there may feel like they live in a different country, and many residents may not want their system to merge with China’s, but Hong Kong has been a special administrative region of the People’s Republic for decades. The political mislabelling may not be quite as insulting as Dolce & Gabbana’s crass advertising campaign last year that featured a Chinese woman struggling to eat pizza with chopsticks. Still, domestic politicians and social media have reason to cry foul.  So far, so easy. But what if Beijing acts on its thinly veiled threats to stifle Hong Kong’s protests with military force? Blood on the streets would shock the growing band of investors who are guided by environmental, social and governance standards. Luxury is especially exposed to pressure. It represents foreign goods which bring no prized technology, obvious targets for renewed nationalism. Western bosses could have to choose between virtuously condemning human rights abuses and profit-harming boycotts proposed by Chinese stakeholders on huge social media networks like Weibo and WeChat. Dolce & Gabbana’s brand is struggling to recover from last year’s run-in with national pride. Even gorging on humble pie may still leave luxury peers hungry for profits.

597	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1V40SC	August 14, 2019 /  8:49 AM / in 8 months	Prudential to split by year-end; monitoring Hong Kong protests	LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s biggest insurer Prudential (PRU.L) will complete a planned break-up of the company by the end of the year, with its UK-focused fund and insurance business set to list as M&G Plc.  The Asia and U.S.-focused rump of the company will continue to trade as Prudential and be listed in the UK, but will be subject to the regulator in Hong Kong - where Prudential said it was “carefully monitoring” current violent protests in the city.  “We expect to complete the demerger of M&GPrudential in the fourth quarter of 2019, and preparations are complete for Prudential Plc’s move to group-wide supervision by the Hong Kong Insurance Authority,” Chief Executive Mike Wells said in a statement.  “We believe that the demerger will enable both businesses to maximize their potential performance.”  Prudential said last year it planned to split into two companies, a route followed by insurance and asset management peers including Old Mutual and Standard Life Aberdeen.  The process has been slow, though, due to the need for a court process to complete a transfer of 12 billion pounds  ($14.5 billion) in annuities to insurer Rothesay Life. Prudential agreed the sale of the book of closed policies to Rothesay last year.      While splitting the two companies had been a complex task, Wells said it would allow both to perform better and had been done from a “position of strength”.  John Foley, the chief executive of M&GPrudential and post-demerger of M&G Plc, said the split would open “many doors” for the company and help it tap growing global demand to save for retirement.  “An independent M&GPrudential will be in a far stronger position to seize the many opportunities we see out there,” he said.  While it would keep the Prudential brand for savings and insurance customers in the UK and Europe, and for asset management in South Africa, M&G would be the asset management brand globally.  Total assets under management rose 6% in January-June from a year earlier to more than 341 billion pounds, Foley said, although like most of its major fund rivals, the bulk of that came from market moves more than offsetting net outflows of client cash.  At 1123 GMT, shares in Prudential were down 1.3%.  The split will enable the part of the group focused on Asia and the United States to be regulated in Hong Kong, where capital rules are considered less onerous.  Prudential, which has a substantial business in mainland China and Hong Kong, has seen its shares hit hard by the long-running trade tussle between China and the United States, but Wells said business had not been impacted.  Sales of insurance in mainland China jumped 45% in the first half from a year earlier, beating peers, Wells said, and the company now had a network of 231 sales offices in 89 cities.   Wells declined to comment on the political situation in Hong Kong but said the company was “obviously taking appropriate precautions for our employees”, without elaborating.  The former British colony has been rocked by around 10 weeks of increasingly violent clashes between police and pro-democracy protesters in the worst crisis since the territory reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997.          Stripping out the performance of its M&GPrudential unit over the period, Prudential saw a 14% rise in half-year operating profit to 2.02 billion pounds, driven by robust growth in its Asian business.  “The group’s performance has again been driven by our Asian business, where we have delivered double-digit growth across our key metrics of operating profit,” Wells said in a statement.  “We are benefiting from growing demand for health, protection and savings across the region.”  New business profit in Asia rose 10% over the six months to the end of June, while assets under management at its Asia-focused fund unit Eastspring grew 12% to 169.5 billion pounds.

598	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N25A2LR	August 14, 2019 /  8:49 AM / in 8 months	Prudential to split by year-end; monitoring Hong Kong protests	LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s biggest insurer Prudential (PRU.L) will complete a planned break-up of the company by the end of the year, with its UK-focused fund and insurance business set to list as M&G Plc.  The Asia and U.S.-focused rump of the company will continue to trade as Prudential and be listed in the UK, but will be subject to the regulator in Hong Kong - where Prudential said it was “carefully monitoring” current violent protests in the city.  “We expect to complete the demerger of M&GPrudential in the fourth quarter of 2019, and preparations are complete for Prudential Plc’s move to group-wide supervision by the Hong Kong Insurance Authority,” Chief Executive Mike Wells said in a statement.  “We believe that the demerger will enable both businesses to maximize their potential performance.”  Prudential said last year it planned to split into two companies, a route followed by insurance and asset management peers including Old Mutual and Standard Life Aberdeen.  The process has been slow, though, due to the need for a court process to complete a transfer of 12 billion pounds  ($14.5 billion) in annuities to insurer Rothesay Life. Prudential agreed the sale of the book of closed policies to Rothesay last year.      While splitting the two companies had been a complex task, Wells said it would allow both to perform better and had been done from a “position of strength”.  John Foley, the chief executive of M&GPrudential and post-demerger of M&G Plc, said the split would open “many doors” for the company and help it tap growing global demand to save for retirement.  “An independent M&GPrudential will be in a far stronger position to seize the many opportunities we see out there,” he said.  While it would keep the Prudential brand for savings and insurance customers in the UK and Europe, and for asset management in South Africa, M&G would be the asset management brand globally.  Total assets under management rose 6% in January-June from a year earlier to more than 341 billion pounds, Foley said, although like most of its major fund rivals, the bulk of that came from market moves more than offsetting net outflows of client cash.  At 1123 GMT, shares in Prudential were down 1.3%.  The split will enable the part of the group focused on Asia and the United States to be regulated in Hong Kong, where capital rules are considered less onerous.  Prudential, which has a substantial business in mainland China and Hong Kong, has seen its shares hit hard by the long-running trade tussle between China and the United States, but Wells said business had not been impacted.  Sales of insurance in mainland China jumped 45% in the first half from a year earlier, beating peers, Wells said, and the company now had a network of 231 sales offices in 89 cities.   Wells declined to comment on the political situation in Hong Kong but said the company was “obviously taking appropriate precautions for our employees”, without elaborating.  The former British colony has been rocked by around 10 weeks of increasingly violent clashes between police and pro-democracy protesters in the worst crisis since the territory reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997.          Stripping out the performance of its M&GPrudential unit over the period, Prudential saw a 14% rise in half-year operating profit to 2.02 billion pounds, driven by robust growth in its Asian business.  “The group’s performance has again been driven by our Asian business, where we have delivered double-digit growth across our key metrics of operating profit,” Wells said in a statement.  “We are benefiting from growing demand for health, protection and savings across the region.”  New business profit in Asia rose 10% over the six months to the end of June, while assets under management at its Asia-focused fund unit Eastspring grew 12% to 169.5 billion pounds.      While there has been speculation Prudential may seek to sell off Jackson, its U.S. business, Wells said the company remained committed to the region and was actively targeting the growing number of ‘Baby Boomers’ set to retire in the coming years.  However, he said he wanted the unit to accelerate its diversification and cash-flow generation, after reporting a 14% rise in first-half operating profit. 	Reuters

Ten weeks of increasingly violent clashes between police and pro-democracy protesters, angered by a perceived erosion of freedoms, are posing one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.   Demonstrators and riot police clashed at Hong Kong’s airport late on Tuesday after flights were canceled for a second day. Protesters at one point held a man who Chinese media have said was a reporter from China’s Global Times newspaper.  A front-page commentary on the overseas edition of the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily newspaper said on Wednesday Hong Kong had reached a critical juncture.   “Using the sword of the law to stop violence and restore order is overwhelmingly the most important and urgent task for Hong Kong!” it said.  Another commentary by a Shenzhen University researcher, published by the China Daily, said the central government should deal with Hong Kong issues more decisively.  Demonstrators say they are fighting the erosion of the “one country, two systems” arrangement that enshrined some autonomy for Hong Kong after China took it back from Britain in 1997.  U.S. President Donald Trump said on Twitter overnight the Chinese government was moving troops to the border with Hong Kong and urged calm.  However, Chinese state media has stopped short of calling for military action to deal with the protests.   “Extreme political ideas have found frequent expression in Hong Kong, with some even raising ‘Hong Kong independence’ slogans recently. Which means the ‘one country, two systems’ principle faces a new challenge,” said Li Peiwen, author of the China Daily commentary.   Police said a large group at the airport had “harassed and assaulted a visitor and a journalist”. Some protesters said they believed one of those men was an undercover Chinese agent, while another was confirmed as a reporter from China’s Global Times, a tabloid published by the People’s Daily.  The incident involving the reporter, named by his newspaper as Fu Guohao, has particularly hit a nerve, with the reporter’s name trending as a hashtag on the Twitter-like Weibo on Wednesday.   A short video clip of Fu, with his hands tied behind his head, has also gone viral on WeChat, China’s ubiquitous messaging system, and Weibo. “I support Hong Kong police, you can hit me now,” Fu yells in the clip.  Netizens shared stylized images of Fu with the quote, as well as one posted by Global Times that read “Shame for Hong Kong.”  One of the most widely circulated images came from a comic artist, Shituzi. He drew an image of a man with his hands tied and Fu’s words, posting on Weibo, “I’m so angry I can’t sleep, you can share this image without any attribution.”  Fu’s words were even made into a t-shirt, sold for 98 yuan  ($13.98) on Alibaba’s (BABA.N) online shopping platform Taobao.com.   “He’s a real man, our homeland and citizens will remember you,” said one user on Wechat, commenting on the clip posted by Global Times.  “Fu Guohao is a real hero!” said another.   In the early weeks of the Hong Kong protests, little news or footage made their way into the mainland through official channels as censors worked to remove any mentions of the demonstrations. Hong Kong now dominates the news in the mainland.  But state broadcaster CCTV has started regularly airing interviews with pro-police demonstrators in recent weeks.   On Monday, it said a female protester, who was hit by a pellet round in the right eye during clashes with the police, had been blinded by a fellow protester although there have been conflicting claims online over how she got hurt. On Wednesday, it showed interviews with stranded travelers at the Hong Kong airport.  Online, official media has also posted messages of support for the Hong Kong police, describing what was happening in the city as “a shame”. Such posts were the most-discussed topics on China’s social media platforms on Wednesday.   “We support the Hong Kong police too!” said a post on the People’s Daily’s official Twitter-like Weibo account that was reposted more than 500,000 times.   Netizens have been closely watching what Beijing might do next after China this week condemned some protesters for using dangerous tools to attack police and said the clashes showed “sprouts of terrorism.”  The Global Times reported on Monday that China’s People’s Armed Police assembled in the southeastern city of Shenzhen, fuelling speculation of a possible intervention in Hong Kong.   Some reactions on China’s social media platforms called for Beijing to intervene while many others urged calm.

Balfour has sought to shore up cash and profitability in Britain as the infrastructure sector gets fewer contracts since the country voted to leave the European Union.    The company also increased its annual cash forecast, supported by lower costs, higher margin projects and a rare encouraging outlook in the beleaguered industry.   Construction activity in Britain shrank for a third month in a row in July as Brexit worries hit building projects, heightening concerns that the slowdown could spill over into other areas of the economy, a survey showed.   The FTSE 250 listed company increased its annual cash forecast by about 50 million pounds to between 280 million pounds and 300 million pounds and said pretax profit rose to 64 million pounds ($77.17 million) for the six months ended June 28 from 56 million pounds a year earlier.  “At UK Construction, there is plenty of disheartening data but Balfour, like Costain (COSG.L), is there for the survivor’s photo,” Liberum analysts said.  Infrastructure firm Costain (COSG.L) expects lower full-year revenue as it had been hit by delays in contracts starts, but its order book grew, helped by new project wins.  London-based Balfour, which is working on projects that are part of expanding Heathrow Airport and the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, said underlying profit from operations at its domestic construction business rose to 17 million pounds ($20.49 million)from 5 million pounds a year earlier.  Balfour worked on projects including a M4 Smart Motorway contract, the A14 in Cambridgeshire - UK’s largest current road project, HS2 and Hinkley Point C.  Balfour’s total order book rose 5% to 13.2 billion pounds.     It said decisions to proceed with the HS2 high-speed rail network and Heathrow airport expansion would significantly improve its outlook.   “Investors in embattled construction firm Kier (KIE.L) or those unlucky enough to be shareholders in Carillion when it went bust must be looking at today’s first half results from rival Balfour Beatty and turning green with envy,” AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.  Mould added that growth was pinned on the infrastructure developments projects.   Balfour shares rose 8.9% to 219.8 pence at 0921 GMT.     Balfour will stockpile housing materials to battle Brexit-driven delays and has a “Brexit clause” in contracts, Chief Executive Officer Leo Quinn told Reuters.  “Our contracts take into account the fact that the likes of Brexit could cause delays, which could have a financial impact ... we don’t remain liable for any financial consequences associated with Brexit delay,” he said.    The company, which operates a 50-50 joint venture based in Hong Kong, said there could be slight administrative delays in delivering contracts because of the clashes between police and pro-democracy protesters.  The company also said it would not currently change short term financial forecasts after allegations of falsified maintenance records at two U.S. air force bases. 	Reuters

The boost from the U.S. announcement overnight eclipsed a raft of unexpectely weak data from China which pointed to a further loss of economic momentum, including the weakest industrial output growth in more than 17 years.  The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index advanced as much as 0.5% in early trade, also supported by strong gains in CSL Ltd after the biotech giant reported record earnings for 2019. The market eased slightly to 6,575.10, up 6.6 points by 0150 GMT.  The index closed 0.3% lower on Tuesday on concerns about a number of geopolitical events, including the trade war, Hong Kong protests and Argentina’s peso crash.  U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to selectively delay tariffs on certain imports that were set to go into effect on Sept. 1 was seen by many as possibly dialling down immediate frictions that have been at the forefront over the last week.  RBC Economists Nathan Janzen and Claire Fan said in a note that the postponement provides some respite but not an end to the uncertainty over trade policy, noting the issue was “moving back closer to a simmer than a boil.”  Major miners Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group jumped as much as 4.8% and 5.5%, respectively.  Australian miners are particularly exposed to the trade war as the Asian giant is the country’s largest trading partner.  CSL, Australia’s fourth-largest listed company, provided the biggest boost to the benchmark on the back of its strong 2019 results. CSL climbed as much as 7.4% to an all-time high.  At the other end of the market, gold stocks, which have been in favour with investors as a safe haven amid trade tensions, sank lower. Newcrest Mining dropped 3.6%, while Evolution Mining fell 6.5%.  Overall gains were also capped by a 3.2% fall in Australia’s top lender Commonwealth Bank of Australia as it traded ex-dividend.  National Australia Bank, the third largest lender by market value, fell 0.3% after reporting flat growth in its third-quarter cash profit and flagged more expenses related to customer remediation in the second half of fiscal 2019.  New Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index edged 0.1% higher to 10,864.07.  Vista Group, which supplies software to the global movie industry, led the gains with a 2% rise, while Synlait Milk rose 1.9%. 	Reuters

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the situation in Hong Kong was tricky, but he hoped it would work out for everybody, including China, and “for liberty” without anyone getting hurt or killed.  Trump cited U.S. intelligence as saying that China’s government was moving troops to its border with Hong Kong, and urged calm as clashes continued between protesters and authorities in the former British colony.  It was not immediately clear whether Trump was reporting fresh troop movements or movements near the border already reported in the media. “Our Intelligence has informed us that the Chinese Government is moving troops to the Border with Hong Kong. Everyone should be calm and safe!” he tweeted.  “The Hong Kong thing is a very tough situation - very tough,” Trump told reporters earlier during a visit to Morristown, New Jersey. “We’ll see what happens.”  “It’s a very tricky situation. I think it will work out and I hope it works out, for liberty. I hope it works out for everybody, including China,” Trump said. “I hope it works out peacefully. I hope nobody gets hurt. I hope nobody gets killed.”  The U.S. State Department, meanwhile, said U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi “had an extended exchange of views on U.S.-China relations” on Tuesday. It did not elaborate.   China’s state media reported this week that China has been assembling the People’s Armed Police and conducting exercises in the neighboring Chinese city of Shenzhen, adding to fears that Beijing might directly intervene to quell the protests.  The People’s Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong also recently released a video showing troops conducting anti-riot exercises against protesters, as its top commander in the city warned violence is “absolutely impermissible”  Demonstrators protesting a perceived erosion of civil liberties under Chinese rule clashed with police at Hong Kong’s international airport late on Tuesday, plunging the former British colony deeper into turmoil after 10 weeks of increasingly violent clashes.  The protests present Chinese President Xi Jinping with one of his biggest challenges, and Hong Kong legal experts say Beijing might be paving the way to use anti-terrorism laws to try to quell the demonstrations.  A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “Freedoms of expression and assembly are core values that we share with the people of Hong Kong and these freedoms should be protected.”  Trump, who has been seeking a major deal to correct trade imbalances with China, drew criticism this month after he described the Hong Kong protests as “riots,” and said they were a matter for China and Hong Kong to deal with as the territory was part of China.  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned China on Monday that any violent crackdown on protests in Hong Kong would be “completely unacceptable,” while Trump administration officials urged all sides to refrain from violence.  On Tuesday, China’s state media said an official with the foreign ministry office in Hong Kong denounced the “arrogance and biases of some U.S. politicians,” adding that McConnell’s remarks sent protesters a “seriously mistaken signal.”  In a statement later on Tuesday, China’s foreign ministry told Washington to stay out of its internal affairs after some U.S. lawmakers, including House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, condemned what they called acts of violence by police against protesters in Hong Kong.  Washington has denied Chinese suggestions that it has a hand in the unrest. But Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the lawmakers’ comments “provided new and powerful evidence to the world.”  “They have disregarded the facts, turned what’s black into white, and characterized violent crimes as a beautiful fight for human rights and freedom,” Hua said in a statement.  On Monday, Pelosi, a Democrat, tweeted that she was alarmed to see the Hong Kong police, “with support from Beijing, intensify their use of force against the protesters and label them violent criminals.”  Pelosi added, in an apparent reference to Trump’s prioritizing of trade talks with China: “If we don’t speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interests, we lose all moral authority to speak out elsewhere.”  In his comment to reporters, Trump also said that a phone call between senior Chinese and U.S. trade officials on Tuesday had been very productive and his administration had decided to delay tariffs on some Chinese imports until mid-December to avoid hurting U.S. shoppers heading into the Christmas holiday.      Last week, State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus called China a “thuggish regime” for disclosing photographs and personal details of a U.S. diplomat who met with Hong Kong’s student leaders. On Friday, she said the reports had “gone from irresponsible to dangerous” and must stop.  On Monday, the State Department repeated calls for Beijing to adhere to its commitments after its 1997 handover from British rule to allow Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy and said it was important to respect freedoms of speech and assembly.

Online trading platform Plus500 soared on a buy-back plan.  The FTSE 100, which had started off the session in the red amid Hong Kong protests and the U.S.-China trade worries, ended 0.3% higher. The midcap index rose 0.5%.  The United States delayed imposing a 10% import tariff on laptops, cell phones, video game consoles and some other products made in China that had been scheduled to start next month, in an abrupt pull-back from a hardline stance on Chinese trade.  That had taken focus off the worries over protests in Hong Kong, which had recently weighed on shares in the FTSE 100’s Asia-focussed financials such as HSBC and Standard Chartered.  Still, the Hong Kong protests’ impact on Asia-focussed financials including HSBC, as well as pressure from simmering U.S.-China trade tensions have placed the FTSE 100 on track for its biggest monthly fall since October 2018.  “With worries about a recession brewing in Germany, political uncertainty in Italy and violent scenes in Hong Kong, the easing up of hostilities between the US and China has been a welcome change to the doom and gloom of the past few days,” CMC Markets analyst David Madden said.  On the midcap index, Plus500 surged 21%, erasing one-third of its year-to-date losses, after its new share buyback plan offset a more than 50% slump in first-half earnings.  Luxury carmaker Aston Martin, on the other hand, lost 4% after Credit Suisse downgraded its rating and slashed its price target by more than two-thirds. A Financial Times report also said hedge funds had taken short positions in the company.

Earlier, Bachelet had urged Hong Kong to exercise restraint and investigate evidence of its forces firing tear gas at protesters in ways banned by international law.  China’s mission to the U.N. in Geneva said in a statement that Hong Kong protesters had smashed public facilities, paralyzed the airport, blocked public transport and used lethal weapons, “showing a tendency of resorting to terrorism”.

Adding pressure to U.S. stock index futures was a Labor Department report that showed the consumer price index rose 0.3% last month, in line with expectations, with core CPI rising 2.2% in the 12 months through July.  “Core CPI was a bit higher-than-expected and anything that decreases the odds of the Fed being aggressive in cutting rates is going to be viewed as a negative,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.  Financial markets have fully priced in a rate cut at the U.S. central bank’s September meeting following a recent escalation in the bruising trade war between the United States and China, which led to an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve and raised the risk of a recession.  The benchmark S&P 500 is now about 5% away from its all-time high hit last month that was driven mainly by hopes that the Federal Reserve would adopt a looser monetary policy to impede the impact of the trade war.  Protests in Hong Kong and a crash in Argentina’s currency and its stock market have driven up demand for safe-haven gold and the Japanese yen.  “The situations in Argentina and Hong Kong have been unsettling and while they are not critical by themselves to global growth, it’s adding to the negative sentiment.”  At 8:34 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 78 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 e-minis were down 9 points, or 0.31% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 29.25 points, or 0.39%.

If that wasn’t enough, Europe’s bourses and the euro were given an additional shove lower by an alarming German sentiment survey after some heavy falls in China, Hong Kong, Japan had also whacked down Asia overnight.  MSCI’s main 47-country world index has dropped nearly 4% this month already and with Wall Street futures pointing to a 0.2% start in the red for New York, those hoping for a rebound were left tallying up the worries.  Hong Kong’s airport, the world’s busiest cargo hub, had been forced to suspend check-ins again as the mood remained febrile after weeks of increasingly violent demonstrations in the Chinese-ruled territory.  Investors were also still assessing the damage caused by Monday’s crash in Argentina after its President Mauricio Macri became the latest pro-free market, pro-reform leader to be given a beating at the polls by a populist rival.  Battered local markets were struggling to decide which way to go. Government bond price and bank stocks were showing tentative signs of stabilisation, but nothing compared to what was lost in Monday’s mauling.  The peso dropped 15%, equities had crumbled 48% in dollar terms - the second-biggest one-day slump anywhere since 1950 - while a 100-year bond that investors had gobbled up recently tumbling 20% as fears of yet another default spiked.  “Yes, Argentina is a small economy. However, the last thing global markets want to see is another market-friendly government fall to populism and/or geopolitics,” said Rabobank strategist Michael Every.  He added the “wall of worry” also now includes: the trade war, Brexit, China, Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Kashmir, North Korea, South China Sea, Turkey, and Venezuela. “Did I miss anything with tired eyes?”  With so much uncertainty around, Europe’s traditional safety play, the 10-year German government bond, saw yields hit a new record low of -0.6%  The dismal data had driven that too showing that economic sentiment among German investors had slumped far more than expected last month and to the lowest level since the euro debt crisis was ratcheting up in late 2011.  Equivalent U.S. Treasury yields were straining for their lowest in almost three years too, gold climbed to a fresh six-year high and the yen stayed within a whisker of a seven-month peak versus the dollar.  ING analysts said the yen was benefiting “from the best of both worlds”, pointing to general risk aversion and a rush to price in more interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. They think the yen, at 105.10 in Europe, will rally to 102 or 103 per dollar later this year.  The Swiss franc, also viewed as a safe haven, rose 0.1% to a two-year high against the euro of 1.0862 francs though that was largely down to another dip from the euro as it backpedalled to $1.1204 against the dollar.  While there was a danger the moves were be being exaggerated by low northern hemisphere summer trading volumes, there was no shortage of gloomy news for investors looking to catch their breath from several months of market ructions.  The weeks-long protests in Hong Kong began in opposition to a bill allowing extraditions to mainland China but have quickly morphed into the biggest challenge to China’s authority over the city since it took Hong Kong back from Britain in 1997.  A state of “panic and chaos” now exists, the city’s embattled leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday, defying fresh calls to quit.  As she spoke, the benchmark Hang Seng index hit a seven-month low. By the close, it had dropped 2.1%, dragging down markets across Asia and taking its losses since the protests began in June past 6%.  MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares skidded 1.2% as Chinese stocks and the Nikkei in Tokyo both fell around 1% too though at least the yuan remained quiet.  The dive for safety pushed gold up another 0.5% to $1.523 per ounce and its latest six-year high.  Oil prices meanwhile held their ground as expectations that major producers will continue to reduce supplies balanced out worries about sluggish economic growth.  Brent crude inched up to $58.74 while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were flat at $54.81 a barrel.  It comes too with Saudi Arabia repushing plans to float its national oil company Saudi Aramco in what could be the world’s largest initial public offering (IPO).  “With Saudi Aramco reportedly eyeing an IPO once again, there is some support to the idea that Saudi Arabia has a heightened interest in strong crude prices and will cut its own output accordingly,” Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy said.

Sathya Narayanan  Aug 13 (Reuters) - Gold hit a more than six-year high on Tuesday as unrest in Hong Kong and a rout in the Argentine peso drove investors already spooked by the U.S.-China trade war into havens such as bullion at the expense of riskier assets such as stocks.  Spot gold was up 1% at $1,525.99 per ounce as of 1123 GMT, off a day high of $1,534.31 - its highest level since April 2013.  U.S. gold futures was up 1.3% to $1,537 an ounce.  “Bond yields and equities are down which are the main reason for gold to be higher. There is a bit of safe-haven (interest),” ABN Amro analyst Georgette Boele said. “People are nervous about Hong Kong again, and that’s why Asian markets were down.”  Share markets slid for a third day on Tuesday as investors were spooked by fears of a drawn-out global trade war, the Hong Kong protests and a crash in the peso.  In Hong Kong, pro-democracy protesters on Monday managed to shut down the city’s airport, the world’s busiest air cargo hub.  Elsewhere, Argentina’s peso collapsed on Monday, losing roughly 15% of its value against dollar after crumbling to an all-time low.  Fears of a possible return to interventionist policies of the previous government have gripped the Argentine market since market-friendly President Mauricio Macri lost a primary election by a bigger-than-expected margin.  Bullion, along with the Japanese yen and U.S. Treasuries, is seen as a relatively safe investment in times of political and financial uncertainty.  The yen rose to a seven-month high against the dollar in the previous session, while U.S. 30-year bond yields extended Monday’s losses to slip to their lowest since July 2016.  Analysts said negative debt yields around the globe were further supporting bullion. Non-interest bearing gold tends to benefit when yields on other assets are low.  Market focus is now on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s annual symposium next week for clues on the future trajectory of interest rates. Traders see a 69% chance of a 25 basis-point rate cut by the U.S. central bank this September.  On the technical front, “a solid breakout and daily close above the $1525 level is likely to inject gold bulls with enough inspiration to challenge $1,550,” FXTM analyst Lukman Otunuga said in a note.  Holdings in the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust, jumped 0.9% to 847.77 tonnes on Monday.  Among other precious metals, silver climbed 2% to $17.40 per ounce, having touched its highest since January 2018. Platinum rose 1.4% to $864.77, while palladium gained 0.5% to $1,434.68 an ounce.

The euro briefly extended an earlier decline after a survey showed German sentiment deteriorated more than expected.  Investors have flocked to the yen amid an escalating trade war between China and the United States and worries about a global economic slowdown. The Japanese currency, along with the dollar and Swiss franc, is a safe haven in times of uncertainty.  The yen got a fresh boost from growing unrest in Hong Kong and surprise election results in Argentina that led to a rout in the country’s currency, the peso, and stocks and bonds.  ING analysts said the yen was benefiting “from the best of both worlds”, pointing to general risk aversion and a rush to price in more interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. They think the yen will rally to 102 or 103 per dollar later this year.  U.S. Treasury yields have declined steadily recently, and the spread between U.S. and Japanese benchmark 10-year yields has shrunk to its narrowest since November 2016.  The yen fell as much as 0.2% to 105.1 per dollar. It reached 105.05 on Monday, a seven-month high and, excluding the January flash crash, its strongest since early 2018.  The dollar rose 0.2% against a basket of other currencies, its index reaching 97.563 before giving up some of those gains.  The Swiss franc, also viewed as a safe haven, rose 0.1% to a two-year high against the euro of 1.0862 francs.  The euro was last down 0.1% at $1.1204 against the dollar, having fallen as low as $1.1182.  The offshore Chinese yuan <CNH=EBS was little changed at 7.104 after the People’s Bank of China set a midpoint rate at an 11-year low that was still stronger than expected.  A senior official at the People’s Bank of China told Reuters on Tuesday that the yuan was at an appropriate level .  Argentina’s peso lost more than 15% to 52.15 per dollar on Monday after brushing a record low of 61.99 .  Argentina’s president, Mauricio Macri, lost in presidential primaries by a wider margin than expected, triggering worries about a return to interventionist policies under a populist winner.  Commerzbank strategist Antje Praefcke said that the reaction elsewhere to the Argentine primary result was a “sign of just how jittery markets are”.  Sterling bounced around $1.2080, not far from the $1.2015 it touched on Monday, its lowest in more than two years, as fears of a no-deal Brexit dominated trading. 	Reuters

The world is watching.”  Increasingly violent demonstrations in Hong Kong have plunged the Chinese-ruled territory into its most serious crisis in decades, presenting Chinese leader Xi Jinping with one of his biggest popular challenges and raising fears of direct intervention by Beijing.  Some Hong Kong legal experts say official descriptions of some protesters’ actions as terrorism could lead to the use of extensive anti-terror laws and powers against them.  China’s People’s Armed Police have also assembled in the neighboring city of Shenzhen for exercises, the Chinese state-backed Global Times newspaper said.  On Tuesday, China’s state media said an unidentified official with the Foreign Ministry office in Hong Kong denounced the “arrogance and biases of some U.S. politicians”, adding that McConnell’s remarks sent protesters a “seriously mistaken signal”.  Republican U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been seeking a major deal to correct trade imbalances with China, drew  criticism this month after he described the Hong Kong protests as “riots” and said they were a matter for China and Hong Kong to deal with as the territory was part of China.  On Monday a senior Trump administration official and a State Department spokeswoman urged all sides to refrain from violence, while stressing support for democracy.   The senior official reiterated Trump’s remark that it was a matter between Hong Kong and China, “with the understanding that ‘they’re looking for democracy and I think most people want democracy.’  “Societies are best served when diverse political views are respected and can be freely and peacefully expressed. The United States urges all sides to refrain from violence,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  A State Department spokeswoman repeated calls for Beijing to adhere to its commitments after its 1997 handover from British rule to allow Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy. She said it was important for the Hong Kong government to respect freedoms of speech and assembly  “We condemn violence and urge all sides to exercise restraint, but remain staunch in our support for freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly in Hong Kong,” she said.  “The ongoing demonstrations in Hong Kong reflect the sentiment of Hongkongers and their broad concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy,” she added. “Freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly are core values that we share with Hong Kong; these freedoms must be vigorously protected.”  While some commentators have accused Trump of all but giving China a green light for a crackdown, Beijing has accused Washington of encouraging the protests and angrily denounced July meetings between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence and Hong Kong publisher and democracy activist Jimmy Lai.  Trump has drawn criticism even from some normally supportive media. On Aug. 3, the conservative Washington Examiner called his Hong Kong remarks “a bizarre regurgitation of mainland Chinese propaganda” and added: “We hope this is Trump speaking off the cuff and not him selling out Hong Kong.”  On Monday, Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton told reporters on a visit to London he had talked about Hong Kong with British officials “as part of a general discussion about China.”  He rejected Chinese allegations that a U.S. diplomat was a “black hand” in the demonstrations as “ridiculous” and said it was “incumbent on the Chinese to live up to their obligations” on Hong Kong.  A spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlier that Britain was concerned about the latest violence in Hong Kong and called for calm from all sides.  Last week, State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus called China a “thuggish regime” for disclosing photographs and personal details of a U.S. diplomat who met with Hong Kong’s student leaders. On Friday, she said the reports had “gone from irresponsible to dangerous” and must stop.   Hong Kong’s airport canceled all flights on Monday, blaming demonstrators for the disruptions. China said the anti-government protests that have roiled the city through two summer months had begun to show “sprouts of terrorism.” 	Reuters

The Hang Seng Index .HSI fell 2.1% to 25,281.30 points on Tuesday, down 16% from the year's peak, and is at lows last seen in early January.  It has fallen over 8% since June 12, when street clashes escalated between anti-government demonstrators and the police.   Now into their third month, those protests ground Hong Kong’s airport to a halt this week and forced flight cancellations even as both protester and police tactics turned increasingly violent.  Concerns over China’s slowdown, as the Sino-U.S. trade war remains unresolved, have also dragged on Hong Kong’s economy. The Hang Seng is Asia’s second-worst performer after South Korea’s this quarter.  Other risk indicators in markets are flashing red.   The Hong Kong dollar HKD=D3, pegged to the greenback at 7.75-7.85, was trading at 7.8465.  “The recent mounting social unrest was fuelling political risk and in turn capital outflow pressure,” Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank, said in a note on Tuesday. “We do not rule out HKD falling to 7.85 level again.”  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam pleaded on Tuesday for a stop to the protests, having warned of an economic “tsunami” engulfing the city last week.  The protests have angered Beijing, which called them “sprouts of terrorism”.  “Dropping the ‘T’ word is particularly disturbing as it does suggest a more aggressive mainland response, which triggered a wave of risk aversion across global markets,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner at VM Markets in Singapore, referring to Beijing’s response.  In the forex options market, risk reversal spreads were at their highest since 2016 on Monday in favor of dollar calls, suggesting investors are paying a high premium to bet on the Hong Kong dollar’s drop. HKD3MRR= HKD6MRR=  A CSOP Asset Management ETF that allows investors to bet against the Hang Seng (7500.HK) jumped to its highest on Tuesday since launching in May.  The product broke its record in turnover of HK$916.2 million ($116.8 million) on Aug. 6, one day after protesters gridlocked Hong Kong with a general strike and the Chinese yuan CNY=CFXS fell to the weaker side of 7-per-dollar.   Local interbank rates HIBOR= have not moved much but a key gauge of cash levels in Hong Kong, banks’ aggregate balances held with the central bank, stood at HK$54.4 billion as of Tuesday - an 87% decline from its 2015 peak, when the city attracted foreign inflows as global central banks kept interest rates at historic lows.

Early 0.3%-0.6% drops from Europe’s main indexes after some heavy falls in China, Hong Kong, Japan and other parts of Asia left MSCI’s main 47-country world index down nearly 4% for August so far.  Hong Kong’s airport, the world’s busiest cargo hub, had reopened after protests closed it the previous day, but the mood remained febrile after weeks of increasingly violent demonstrations in the Chinese-ruled territory.  Investors were also still assessing the wider damage caused by Monday’s crash in Argentina after its President Mauricio Macri became the latest pro-free market, pro-reform leader to be given a beating at the polls by a populist rival.  The response was brutal.

The yen got a fresh boost from growing unrest in Hong Kong and surprise election results in Argentina that led to a rout in the country’s currency, the peso, and stocks and bonds.  ING analysts said the yen was benefiting “from the best of both worlds”, pointing to general risk aversion and a rush to price in more interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. They think the yen will rally to 102 or 103 per dollar later this year.  U.S. Treasury yields have declined steadily recently, and the spread between U.S. and Japanese benchmark 10-year yields has shrunk to its narrowest since November 2016.  The yen was unchanged by 0720 GMT at 105.32 per dollar. It reached 105.05 on Monday, a seven-month high and, excluding the January flash crash, its strongest since early 2018.  The dollar rose 0.2% against a basket of other currencies, its index reaching 97.563.  The euro weakened 0.2% to $1.1196. German inflation data in line with forecasts did little to support it.  The offshore Chinese yuan <CNH=EBS was little changed at 7.104 after the People’s Bank of China set a midpoint rate at an 11-year low that was still stronger than expected.  A senior official at the People’s Bank of China told Reuters on Tuesday that the yuan was at an appropriate level .  Argentina’s peso lost roughly 15% to 52.15 per dollar on Monday after brushing a record low of 61.99.  Fears of a possible return to interventionist policies, and by extension a possible debt default, gripped the market after conservative Argentina President Mauricio Macri lost in presidential primaries by a margin much wider than expected .  Commerzbank strategist Antje Praefcke said that the reaction elsewhere to the Argentine primary result was a “sign of just how jittery markets are”.  Sterling slipped 0.2% to $1.2052, near the $1.2015 it touched on Monday, its lowest in more than two years, as fears of a no-deal Brexit dominated trading.

Spot gold rose 0.7% to $1,521.98 per ounce as of 0715 GMT, its highest since April 2013.  U.S. gold futures rose 1% to $1,533 an ounce.  “It is a pretty straight forward case of risk aversion. Crisis in Argentina and political deterioration in Hong Kong; underlying all of this, global growth is slowing,” said Ilya Spivak, senior currency strategist with DailyFx.  “Central banks can only do so much because a lot of them are at near record low interest rates. There is not a lot of ammunition to deploy as counter measures to the slowdown in global growth.”  Protesters managed to shut down Hong Kong’s airport, the world’s busiest cargo airport, on Monday. The protests, which started as opposition to an extradition bill to mainland China, have expanded into wider calls for democracy.  On the other side of the globe, fears of a possible return to interventionist policies gripped the Argentine market after market-friendly President Mauricio Macri lost by a much bigger-than-expected margin in presidential primaries.  These uncertainties alongside fears of a drawn out Sino-U.S. trade war rattled financial markets, spurring investors to safe-haven assets.  Bullion, along with the Japanese yen and U.S. Treasuries, is seen as a relatively safe investment in times of political and financial uncertainty. The yen stood near a seven-month high against the dollar.  Investors are focused on the Federal Reserve’s annual symposium next week. Traders see a 74% chance of a 25 basis-point rate cut by the Fed this September.  Lower interest rates decrease the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion and weigh on the dollar, making gold cheaper for investors holding other currencies.  “Heightened geopolitical risks from Hong Kong protests along with global growth concerns remain largely supportive towards safe haven flows,” brokerage Phillip Futures said in a note.  “Gold prices must hold above $1,500 for an extension of the bullish wave in the current term.”  Reflecting increased investor interest in gold, holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, jumped 0.9% to 847.77 tonnes on Monday from Friday.  Spot gold may test a resistance at $1,524 per ounce, a break above which could lead to a gain to $1,546, said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.  Among other precious metals, silver climbed 1.8% to $17.36 per ounce. During the session, it hit its highest since January 2018 at $17.42.  Platinum rose 1.3% to $863.83 and palladium gained 0.7% to $1,437.98 an ounce. 	Reuters

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan skidded 1%. Chinese stocks fell 1%, while Hong Kong’s main market index tumbled 1.7% to a seven-month low.  “The protests in Hong Kong are negative for stocks, which were already in an adjustment phase because there is talk that the trade war will trigger a recession,” said Kiyoshi Ishigane, chief fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co.  Hong Kong’s airport, the world’s busiest cargo airport, reopened on Tuesday after protesters managed to close it down the previous day. The mood remained cautious as the increasingly violent demonstrations have plunged the Chinese-ruled territory into its most serious crisis in decades.  The weeks-long protests began in opposition to a bill allowing extraditions to mainland China but have quickly morphed into the biggest challenge to China’s authority over the city since it took Hong Kong back from Britain in 1997.  Japan’s Nikkei was also hit hard, down a sharp 1.2% and on course for its biggest daily decline in a week.  In early European trade, the pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures were unchanged.  U.S. stock futures were 0.23% higher in Asia, but that did little to calm the fragile mood.  Stocks in Singapore shed 1.1% to reach their lowest since June 6 after the government slashed its full-year economic growth forecasts. The city state is often seen as a bellwether for global growth because of its importance as a key trade hub.  The selling in regional markets came as Wall Street stocks took a beating on Monday, with the S&P 500 losing 1.23%.  Sentiment was already weak due to increasing signs that the United States and China will not quickly resolve their year-long trade war. Markets were hit with further turbulence after protesters managed to close down Hong Kong’s airport on Monday.  Traders were also on edge after market-friendly Argentine President Mauricio Macri suffered a mauling in presidential primaries, increasing the risk of a return to interventionist economic policies.  Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were near the lowest in almost three years, gold was pinned close to six-year highs, and the yen was within a whisker of a seven-month peak versus the dollar in a sign of the heightened anxiety in financial markets already battered by global growth woes.  “Long-term rates will continue to fall, and stocks will adjust lower, but this is temporary. Major central banks are cutting rates, which will eventually provide economic support,” Mitsubishi UFJ’s Ishigane said.  Analysts said that trading could be subdued as many investors are off for summer holidays. Yet, there was no shortage of gloomy news for investors looking to catch their breath from several months of market ructions.  Argentina’s peso collapsed on Monday, losing roughly 15% of its value to 52.15 per dollar after crumbling to an all-time low of 61.99 earlier. Voters snubbed Macri by giving the opposition a surprisingly bigger-than-expected victory in Sunday’s primary election.  The Merval stock index <.MERV > crashed 30% and declines of between 18-20 cents in Argentina’s benchmark 10-year bonds left them trading at around 60 cents on the dollar or even lower.  Refinitiv data showed Argentine stocks, bonds and the peso had not recorded this kind of simultaneous fall since the South American country’s 2001 economic crisis and debt default.  The grim backdrop was enough to push investors into safe-havens, and U.S. Treasury yields dropped across the board on Monday as trade worries and political tensions supported safe-haven assets.  In Asia on Tuesday benchmark 10-year Treasuries yields fell to 1.6403%. On August 7 yields had skidded to 1.5950%, the lowest since October 3, 2016.  Spot gold rose 0.47% to $1.518.43 per ounce, near the highest in six years.  The yen last fetched 105.41 per dollar, and was within striking distance of 105.03, its strongest since the January 3 flash crash.  Oil prices edged slightly lower in Asian trading as expectations that major producers will continue to reduce supplies ran into worries about sluggish economic growth.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures fell 0.22% to $54.81 a barrel. 	Reuters

U.S. 30-year bond yields slid to their lowest since July 2016. U.S. long-term yields have fallen in six of the past nine sessions, reflecting investors’ diminished risk appetite.       European bond yields were also lower on the day.  The U.S. yield curve has also flattened significantly, suggesting mounting anxiety. The yield spread between U.S. 2-year and 10-year notes, a closely watched metric, narrowed to 5.3 basis points, the smallest difference since at least 2010, according to Refinitiv data.  The bond rally was triggered by protests in Hong Kong over the weekend, which originally stemmed from opposition to a bill allowing extradition to the mainland. That crippled Hong Kong’s airport, while in Argentina the defeat of President Mauricio Macri during primary elections added to global stress.  “The Hong Kong demonstrations and their ability to shut down the airport and the surprise in Argentina took the wind out of the sails of the stock market,” said Jim Vogel, interest rates strategist at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee.  “We’re back to worrying that things are still unsettled and so there’s no need to push stocks higher, and without that optimism, without that ‘things-are-getting-better’ impulse  behind stocks, Treasury yields are moving to the lower middle of the range,” he added.  Italy also had political problems after the League party last week filed a no-confidence motion against its own governing coalition. The party’s populist chief Matteo Salvini hopes that the motion move will trigger early elections and have him installed as the new leader.  Concern about the U.S.-China trade conflict persisted. A week ago, China allowed the yuan CNY=CFXS to break through the key 7-per-dollar level for the first time since 2008, prompting Washington to label Beijing a currency manipulator and sparking market turmoil.  Analysts also said Monday’s bond rally was exaggerated by a slew of holidays in Asia, particularly Japan, Singapore and India.  In afternoon trading, U.S. benchmark 10-year note yields fell to 1.64% US10YT=RR, from 1.734% late on Friday.  Since the beginning of the year, 10-year yields have fallen more than a hundred basis points, on track for its steepest drop in eight years.  Yields on 30-year bonds slid to 2.13% US30YT=RR, from 2.247% on Friday. Earlier, they fell to a more than three-year low of 2.119%.  At the short end of the curve, two-year yields slipped to 1.581%, from Friday’s 1.63% US2YT=RR.  “As long as there is global political tension, we’re going to get downward pressure on U.S. yields,” Stan Shipley, fixed income strategist, at Evercore ISI in New York, said.

The FTSE 100 index ended 0.4% lower, while the midcap index dropped 0.9% as concerns about the health of the British economy, the world’s fifth-largest, lingered after data on Friday showed a surprise downturn in the last quarter.  CMC Markets analyst David Madden said investors fretted not only over the disappointing numbers but about what lies ahead as Brexit looms.  “Many traders / fund managers are on holiday and given it is a sideways-to-down day, the less liquid areas such as the (FTSE) 250 vs the FTSE 100 will tend to underperform,” Raymond James analyst Chris Bailey pointed out.  Both the UK indexes had earlier jumped about 0.6% on the back of gains in China, but the FTSE 100’s Asia-exposed financials including HSBC took a turn for the worse after China said the anti-government protests in Hong Kong had begun to show “sprouts of terrorism”.  “Hong Kong has kind of been under the radar of most traders but increasingly I feel like this has the potential to spiral into a bigger market worry,” Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said.  “Today’s moves highlight the risks.”  The main index, which was also hurt by U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments last Friday that he was not ready to make a trade deal with China, is on course for its second monthly fall this year. It recorded its first monthly fall in May, when tensions between the world’s two biggest economies flared up.  China reacted to another $300 billion tariff threat by letting its currency fall below a key 7-per-dollar level for the first time in more than a decade earlier this month.  Rolls-Royce, which supplies engines to planemaker Boeing, also weighed with a 3.6% fall after media reports that fragments of an engine fell from a Norwegian Boeing 787 Dreamliner near Rome, Italy. (bit.ly/2YZBFwN)  Among smallcaps, Thomas Cook, the world’s oldest travel company, tanked nearly 18.3% after saying its existing shareholders were expected to be “significantly diluted” as part of its rescue plan.  Tullow Oil was among a handful of gainers on the FTSE 250 with a 20% jump after saying it had made a major oil discovery in Guyana, which raised expectations that it would move to develop a field in the oil-rich South American country.  Burford Capital, whose shares have plummeted under attack from short-seller Muddy Waters, lost another 11.2% after saying it had identified evidence consistent with illegal market manipulation of its shares.

Increasingly violent protests since June have plunged Hong Kong into its most serious crisis in decades and are one of the biggest popular challenges to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.  Cathay became embroiled on Friday when China’s civil aviation regulator demanded the airline suspend personnel who engaged in or supported illegal protests in Hong Kong from staffing flights into its airspace, citing safety concerns.  The airline moved fast to comply with the demand from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), suspending a pilot arrested during anti-government protests in Hong Kong and firing two airport employees citing misconduct on Saturday.   It also said it would bar “overly radical” staff from crewing flights to the mainland, and analysts said the tighter oversight, along with the impact the protests could have on traffic, could affect the airline’s bottom line.  “Not only is this likely to affect direct China flights, but also flights to Europe and, to a lesser extent, to the U.S., given that they fly over China airspace,” Jefferies analyst Andrew Lee said.  Passenger traffic in mainland China, Europe and North America accounted for over 50% of all Cathay’s traffic in the first half of this year, according to Jefferies data.  Cathay was also on Monday among airlines affected by the Hong Kong airport’s decision to cancel all flights. The airline warned passengers in a travel advisory that the impact could last until Tuesday morning.  This would affect about 130 departure flights for Cathay, and in turn over 32,800 passengers, according to travel data specialist Cirium.   Shares in the company tumbled to HK$9.80, their lowest level since the 2009 financial crisis.   Cathay’s largest shareholder is Swire Pacific Ltd (0019.HK), with a 45% stake, followed by China’s flagship carrier, Air China Ltd (0753.HK)(601111.SS) which owns 30%, according to the airline’s latest annual report.   The company, which in March reported its first profit in three years, has seen a decline in forward bookings for travel to Hong Kong due to the Hong Kong protests.   It was not immediately clear how the regulator’s directive would affect flight staffing. Cathay CEO Rupert Hogg told staff the company would report to the CAAC by Thursday on how it would improve flight safety, according to a copy of a letter seen by Reuters.  Cathay did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on staffing, but said that crew lists were being sent in advance of all operations in China. It said the information was no different to what it had always provided to jurisdictions and was being sent in the same general declaration format.   “The only difference is that such information is being sent earlier than in the past in advance of all operations in mainland China,” it said in an e-mailed statement.   The Hong Kong Cabin Crew Federation, a union representing airline employees, has criticized the regulator.    In a statement on Saturday, it said the CAAC should have “respected Hong Kong people’s rights and freedoms” on the basis of the “one country, two systems” principle, which guarantees the former British colony a high degree of autonomy from Beijing.

Anti-government protests were planned in different locations in the Asian financial hub, including one at the city’s international airport for a third day.  On Saturday, police fired volleys of teargas to disperse protesters after activists rallied across the city, with thousands occupying the airport arrivals hall.  Increasingly violent protests have plunged Hong Kong into its most serious political crisis for decades, posing a serious challenge to the central government in Beijing who has taken an increasingly tough line on the protests.  Police said on Sunday they had arrested 16 people during the protests on Saturday for charges including unlawful assembly and possession of an offensive weapon. Authorities have arrested over 600 people since the protests began in June.  China has said the central government would not sit idly by and let the situation continue. Hong Kong’s government has also said the violence and illegal protests were pushing the city to an extremely dangerous edge.  China has also targeted the city’s corporate giants, demanding that the city’s flagship carrier Cathay Pacific Airways suspend staff involved in the demonstrations.  The airline told staff on Saturday it would bar any “overly radical” employees from crewing flights to the mainland and said it had removed a pilot who was arrested at protests last week from duty.  The former British colony of Hong Kong is roiling from months of protests that began against a proposed bill to allow people to be extradited to stand trial in mainland China and have developed into calls for greater democracy.  Police have not given permission for Sunday’s two protests planned in the city’s working class Sham Shui Po district in Kowloon or for North Point on Hong Kong Island.  Several leisure and public facilities have planned to close during the afternoon when the protests are expected.  Protesters have increasingly adopted flash tactics, playing a cat and mouse game with police to evade capture.  Young people have been at the forefront of recent protests, worried about the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong, while also concerned with issues such as wealth disparities in the city.  Elderly people have also been appearing. On Saturday in two separate protests, small groups of elderly Hong Kongers and families marched near the financial centre’s business districts. Both marches and the airport protests were peaceful. 	Reuters

The move followed China’s aviation regulator demanding the airline prevent staff involved in some of the protests in Hong Kong from operating flights to China, describing it as a safety issue.  The broadside poses a major commercial challenge to Cathay, which already reported tumbling bookings last week as a result of the anti-government protests gripping Hong Kong.  The airline said on Saturday in response to customer queries that the pilot had been removed from duties on July 30 “in line with our standard process” and had not flown since July 15.  “We express no view whatsoever on the subject matter of any proceedings to which he may be subject,” the company added in a statement.  For the past two months Hong Kong has been embroiled in increasingly violent anti-government street protests, which a Chinese official described last week as the greatest crisis since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997.  The Cathay pilot, whom the company did not name, was among over 40 people charged with rioting, during clashes with police near Beijing’s main representative office in the city.  In a separate memo on Saturday, Cathay Pacific CEO Rupert Hogg told staff that in order to comply with the new regulatory demands it would not allow any crew supporting protests in Hong Kong to staff flights to the mainland from midnight on Aug. 10.  “Cathay Pacific Group employees who support or take part in illegal protests, violent actions, or overly radical behavior shall be immediately suspended from any activity involving flights to the mainland,” he said.  The memo added that the airline would submit identification details of all crews flying to or over mainland China to authorities there for approval.  “Cathay Pacific Group’s operations in mainland China are key to our business,” he said.

China, whose rule over the city is being challenged by the protests, meanwhile demanded Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways (0293.HK) suspend staff involved in the demonstrations. One of its pilots was arrested last week.   The pair of warnings — one aimed at residents planning more marches still and the other at a business emblematic of the city’s colonial past — mark a toughening stance by authorities as they grapple with Hong Kong’s deepest crisis in decades.      Flanked by business leaders, Chief Executive Lam told reporters that companies in the Asian financial hub were “very worried” about the economic fallout from the protests, which began in June and have become increasingly violent.   “We have had two months of political dispute,” she said after meeting business representatives and senior officials, warning that a downturn “is coming very quickly”.   “Some people have described it as coming like a tsunami ... the economic recovery will take a long time,” Lam said.       What started as an angry response to a now-suspended measure for criminal suspects to be extradited for trial in China has rapidly broadened to encompass calls for more democracy, Lam’s resignation, and even keeping out mainland tourists.  The protests represent a populist challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, just as an escalating trade war between China and the United States also hammers Hong Kong’s economy.  China’s warning on Cathay, saying crew who engaged in the protests pose a threat to safety and should be suspended from staffing flights to the mainland, follows the pilot’s arrest and tumbling bookings.  Cathay has said it is taking the directive seriously, though when asked about staff participating in protests last week, Chairman John Slosar said the company “wouldn’t dream” of telling staff “what to think about something”.  Dozens of other Hong Kong companies have warned of faltering earnings, while city officials caution daily that the protests are hurting livelihoods and could help trigger a recession.  Lam said the city’s Executive Council would next week resume meetings suspended in mid-June to prepare a policy response that would consider “daring measures”.  “For Hong Kong’s society to recover the foundation is the same (as that of the economy),” she said. “We must stop the widespread violence.”  She urged landlords to ease rents on hard-pressed retailers, but dismissed demands for an inquiry into police behavior at demonstrations.  “I disagree with (establishing) an independent inquiry that targets police work,” she said. “I don’t think we should just sort of make concessions in order to silence the violent protesters.”       Young people have been at the forefront of the protests, worried about China encroaching on Hong Kong’s freedoms but also concerned with issues such as sky-high living costs and what many see as an unfair housing policy favoring the wealthy.      Soaring property prices have pushed up rents and had a knock-on effect on prices of goods and services. Last year, Oxfam said the city’s income inequality was at its highest in more than four decades.  Hong Kong’s property developers spoke out for the first time on Friday, urging calm in a statement signed by 17 companies, including CK Asset Holdings Ltd (1113.HK), founded by property tycoon Li Ka-shing, the city’s richest man.  At the airport, protesters sang “Do You Hear the People Sing?” from the musical “Les Miserables” and chanted: “Democracy now” and “Hong Kongers, add oil!” — a popular exhortation in Cantonese.  There was no visible police presence. Seeking to engage tourists, activists handed out anti-government leaflets and waved banners in a dozen languages.     “It will be a peaceful protest as long as the police do not show up,” Charlotte Lam, 16, told Reuters.  “We have made stickers, banners in over 16 languages, ranging from Japanese to Spanish. We want to spread our message internationally. We are not rioters, we are a group of Hong Kong people fighting for human rights and freedom.”  Marches are planned across Hong Kong, Kowloon and the New Territories over the weekend, where protesters could see a shift in police tactics.      To help deal with the protests, Hong Kong has recalled from retirement a police commander who oversaw the response to pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014.      Alan Lau Yip-shing will handle large public events, including activities to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1, the government said in a statement.  The escalating violence has already prompted travel warnings from countries including the United States and Australia, although the airport demonstration did not prompt complaints.  “I don’t really know what to think about the protest,” said Joyce, a New Zealander.   “Right now I just hope it won’t delay my flight. But at the same time, as long as you’re making a point without making too much trouble, it’s OK.” 	Reuters

Hong Kong has been embroiled in increasingly violent anti-government street protests for the past two months, which a top Chinese official described this week as the greatest crisis since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997.  Last week, a Cathay pilot was among over 40 people charged with rioting for allegedly taking part in violent clashes with the police near Beijing’s main representative office in the city.  On Friday night, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said that Cathay crew who have engaged in the protests pose a threat to aviation safety in mainland China, according to a statement on its website.  The aviation authority ordered Cathay to provide identification information for its crew on mainland-bound flights.   Crew members that have not gained the authority’s approval will not be allowed into its airspace, including on flights bound for other destinations.  The airline has also been ordered to draw up proposals to strengthen safety and security, said the statement.  In response, a Cathay Pacific spokesperson said: “We have received the directive and are studying it very carefully. We are treating it seriously and are following up accordingly.”  “The safety of our passengers is always the top priority of Cathay Pacific. There is zero tolerance for any inappropriate and unprofessional behavior that may affect aviation safety. We deal with these incidents very seriously.”  Cathay said on Thursday it respects “everyone’s right to express themselves in a peaceful and respectful manner,” while insisting it “recognizes that Hong Kong SAR is a part of China”.  “We do not condone any activities that jeopardize the stability of Hong Kong,” it said.   On Monday aviation workers joined a strike that gridlocked Hong Kong, forcing airlines, including Cathay, to cancel hundreds of flights.  Responding to a question on the protests at a press conference earlier this week, Cathay chairman John Slosar said the company respects its staff’s opinions.  “We certainly wouldn’t dream of telling them what they have to think about something.

China, whose rule over the city is being challenged by the protests, meanwhile demanded Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways (0293.HK) suspend staff involved in the demonstrations. One of its pilots was arrested last week.   The pair of warnings — one aimed at residents planning more marches still and the other at a business emblematic of the city’s colonial past — mark a toughening stance by authorities as they grapple with Hong Kong’s deepest crisis in decades.      Flanked by business leaders, Chief Executive Lam told reporters that companies in the Asian financial hub were “very worried” about the economic fallout from the protests, which began in June and have become increasingly violent.   “We have had two months of political dispute,” she said after meeting business representatives and senior officials, warning that a downturn “is coming very quickly”.   “Some people have described it as coming like a tsunami ... the economic recovery will take a long time,” Lam said.       What started as an angry response to a now-suspended measure for criminal suspects to be extradited for trial in China has rapidly broadened to encompass calls for more democracy, Lam’s resignation, and even keeping out mainland tourists.  The protests represent a populist challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, just as an escalating trade war between China and the United States also hammers Hong Kong’s economy.  China’s warning on Cathay, saying crew who engaged in the protests pose a threat to safety and should be suspended from staffing flights to the mainland, follows the pilot’s arrest and tumbling bookings.  Cathay has said it is taking the directive seriously, though when asked about staff participating in protests last week, Chairman John Slosar said the company “wouldn’t dream” of telling staff “what to think about something”.  Dozens of other Hong Kong companies have warned of faltering earnings, while city officials caution daily that the protests are hurting livelihoods and could help trigger a recession.  Lam said the city’s Executive Council would next week resume meetings suspended in mid-June to prepare a policy response that would consider “daring measures”.  “For Hong Kong’s society to recover the foundation is the same (as that of the economy),” she said. “We must stop the widespread violence.”  She urged landlords to ease rents on hard-pressed retailers, but dismissed demands for an inquiry into police behavior at demonstrations.  “I disagree with (establishing) an independent inquiry that targets police work,” she said. “I don’t think we should just sort of make concessions in order to silence the violent protesters.”       Young people have been at the forefront of the protests, worried about China encroaching on Hong Kong’s freedoms but also concerned with issues such as sky-high living costs and what many see as an unfair housing policy favoring the wealthy.      Soaring property prices have pushed up rents and had a knock-on effect on prices of goods and services. Last year, Oxfam said the city’s income inequality was at its highest in more than four decades.  Hong Kong’s property developers spoke out for the first time on Friday, urging calm in a statement signed by 17 companies, including CK Asset Holdings Ltd (1113.HK), founded by property tycoon Li Ka-shing, the city’s richest man.  At the airport, protesters sang “Do You Hear the People Sing?” from the musical “Les Miserables” and chanted: “Democracy now” and “Hong Kongers, add oil!” — a popular exhortation in Cantonese.  There was no visible police presence. Seeking to engage tourists, activists handed out anti-government leaflets and waved banners in a dozen languages.     “It will be a peaceful protest as long as the police do not show up,” Charlotte Lam, 16, told Reuters.  “We have made stickers, banners in over 16 languages, ranging from Japanese to Spanish. We want to spread our message internationally. We are not rioters, we are a group of Hong Kong people fighting for human rights and freedom.”  Marches are planned across Hong Kong, Kowloon and the New Territories over the weekend, where protesters could see a shift in police tactics.      To help deal with the protests, Hong Kong has recalled from retirement a police commander who oversaw the response to pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014.      Alan Lau Yip-shing will handle large public events, including activities to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1, the government said in a statement.  The escalating violence has already prompted travel warnings from countries including the United States and Australia, although the airport demonstration did not prompt complaints.  “I don’t really know what to think about the protest,” said Joyce, a New Zealander.   “Right now I just hope it won’t delay my flight. But at the same time, as long as you’re making a point without making too much trouble, it’s OK.” 	Reuters

Hong Kong has been embroiled in increasingly violent anti-government street protests for the past two months, which a top Chinese official described this week as the greatest crisis since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997.  Last week, a Cathay pilot was among over 40 people charged with rioting for allegedly taking part in violent clashes with the police near Beijing’s main representative office in the city.  On Friday night, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said that Cathay crew who have engaged in the protests pose a threat to aviation safety in mainland China, according to a statement on its website.  The aviation authority ordered Cathay to provide identification information for its crew on mainland-bound flights.  Crew members that have not gained the authority’s approval will not be allowed into its airspace, including on flights bound for other destinations.  The airline has also been ordered to draw up proposals to strengthen safety and security, said the statement.  In response, a Cathay Pacific spokesperson said: “We have received the directive and are studying it very carefully. We are treating it seriously and are following up accordingly.”  “The safety of our passengers is always the top priority of Cathay Pacific. There is zero tolerance for any inappropriate and unprofessional behaviour that may affect aviation safety. We deal with these incidents very seriously.”  Cathay said on Thursday it respects “everyone’s right to express themselves in a peaceful and respectful manner,” while insisting it “recognises that Hong Kong SAR is a part of China”.  “We do not condone any activities that jeopardise the stability of Hong Kong,” it said.  On Monday aviation workers joined a strike that gridlocked Hong Kong, forcing airlines, including Cathay, to cancel hundreds of flights.  Responding to a question on the protests at a press conference earlier this week, Cathay chairman John Slosar said the company respects its staff’s opinions.  “We certainly wouldn’t dream of telling them what they have to think about something. They’re all adults, they’re all service professionals. We respect them greatly,” he said.

It can be said that Hong Kong is now facing the most severe situation since its handover,” he said.  Hong Kong has seen months of sometimes violent protests that began with opposition to a now-suspended extradition law and which have evolved into a direct challenge to the government of embattled leader Carrie Lam and calls for full democracy.  Hong Kong’s protests pose a major challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping who is grappling with a trade war with the United States and a slowing economy.  Zhang held a forum on Wednesday to discuss the political crisis in Hong Kong which included Hong Kong delegates to China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress and China’s main consultative body, the CPPCC. No opposition democratic figures or protest representatives were invited.  Speaking after the meeting, several attendees said Zhang cited speeches by former Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in 1984 and 1987 in which he said if “turmoil” occurs in Hong Kong, “the central government must intervene”.  No specific mention, however, was made of deploying the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), which has a garrison in Hong Kong, to quell the unrest, with Zhang cited as saying Beijing remained confident in the Hong Kong government and local police.  “We note with concern the Chinese government’s statements,” a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said, without citing which of the comments Washington considered problematic.  “We urge Beijing to adhere to its commitments in the Sino-British Joint Declaration to allow Hong Kong to exercise a high degree of autonomy,” the spokeswoman said.” We urge all sides to exercise restraint and refrain from violence.”  Elsie Leung, a former justice secretary, said she felt that even if the PLA were deployed it would not conflict with Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” by which it has been governed since 1997. “One country, two systems would continue,” she said.  In China’s sharpest rebuke yet of the protesters, the government warned them on Tuesday not to “play with fire” and called on Hong Kong citizens to protect their homeland.  The Global Times, a Chinese tabloid published by the Communist Party’s People’s Daily, showed a video on its official Twitter feed of thousands of police officers taking part in an anti-riot training drill in Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong.   The protests have drawn millions onto the streets in opposition to an extradition bill that would see suspects tried in mainland courts controlled by the Communist Party. Many feared it would undermine Hong Kong’s independent judiciary and was another step towards full mainland control of Hong Kong.  Several thousand Hong Kong lawyers dressed in black, marched in silence on Wednesday to call on the government to safeguard the independence of the city’s department of justice.  The city’s lawyers fear the justice department’s prosecutions of arrested protesters are taking on an increasingly political slant with over 500 arrests, many charged with rioting, an offence that carries a 10-year jail term.  A female lawyer who declined to be named said she was marching “to make sure the government knows that within the legal sector, we will not allow judicial independence to be compromised by politics or pressure from the Chinese government”.  A group of unidentified government prosecutors published an open letter last week accusing Secretary of Justice Teresa Cheng of putting politics above legal principles.  “All we want is justice and all we want is consistency,” said prominent lawyer Kevin Yam, who also protested. “We don’t want to see thugs get away while the best of our youth get prosecuted. We uphold the rule of law and we ask for justice.”  Protesters are demanding a complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, an independent inquiry into the crisis, an investigation into what they say is excessive use of force by police, and for Hong Kong leader Lam to step down.  A brazen attack by an armed mob on protesters at a train station in Yuen Long on the night of July 21 that left 45 people injured, has so far seen 23 people arrested for the relatively light charge of unlawful assembly. Protesters say police were slow to protect them.  Police fired tear gas in Sham Shui Po late on Tuesday, as protesters gathered outside a police station to demand the release of Keith Fong, a student union leader from Baptist University, who they say was unlawfully arrested by several plain-clothes police for buying laser pointers on the grounds that he possessed offensive weapons.  Protesters have sometimes aimed lasers, which are widely available in shops, at police during recent clashes. 	Reuters

Unlike similar unrest in 2014, investors are getting anxious. Trade tensions and economic weakness in China have helped to erase the Hang Seng Index’s gains this year, but local indicators like real estate and retail are cooling too. Beijing may not mind that protests squeeze business, if the rising cost of resistance divides the movement. That means there could be more disruption to price in.  A rare general strike on Monday halted traffic and shuttered shops across the territory, which has endured both peaceful marches and violent clashes for two months now. Police have retaliated with tear gas and rubber bullets, while pro-Beijing and anti-Beijing factions have assaulted each other on streets and in subway stations. Protesters want a controversial bill allowing extradition to China to be withdrawn, but have other demands too, including universal suffrage.   Despite the drama, the stock market was open. Hong Kong shareholders rarely flinch at political crises: they held steady when protesters occupied the financial hub’s central business district in 2014. But this time could be different.  Markets are frazzled. A depreciating yuan, a trade war, and slowing Chinese demand all hurt Hong Kong’s open economy. While the S&P 500 is up by double digits year-to-date, the Hang Seng Index is flat. Local firms that earn most of their revenue in the special administrative region are particularly hard hit. Property group Sino Land is down more than 10% for the period, and cosmetics seller Sa Sa has lost a third of its market capitalisation. Retailers from luxury group Richemont to high-street pharmacy Watsons reported flagging sales. Tourism numbers are growing more slowly than last year, and the volume of home purchases fell in June, according to Midland Property. Across the board, companies in the city’s benchmark are priced at around 13 times future earnings – peers in the S&P 500 are valued closer to 20 times.   So far staid bond and credit default swap markets have shown little reaction to the rapid decay of the city’s status quo. That might not last. Neither the territory’s nominal leader Carrie Lam nor her backers in the central government appear open to compromise. Escalation would further spook markets: unfortunately that seems more and more likely.  Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

There is also some weakness in outbound traffic, Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Paul Loo said, adding that transfer traffic had been hit less but that the overall situation was placing pressure on average fares.  His comments came after Cathay swung to its first profit for the January-June period since 2016 and said the second half was likely to be better.  The airline reported an HK$1.347 billion ($171.84 million) net profit for the six months ended June 30, compared with an HK$263 million loss for the first half of 2018.  Rising passenger revenue and lower fuel costs helped to offset a decline in the air cargo market linked to the U.S.-China trade war.  Cathay is a bellwether for Hong Kong’s economy, which grew less than expected in the second quarter as mass anti-government protests rocked the territory.  The airline said widespread protests had reduced inbound passenger traffic in July and were adversely impacting forward bookings. The carrier canceled dozens of flights on Monday due to a general strike.     Chairman John Slosar said people were taking a “wait and see” attitude before booking flights.  “The fact forward bookings are down doesn’t mean those bookings are gone,” he told reporters. “People just aren’t booking as far out as they were before.”  However, Cathay said it normally achieved better financial results over July-December and, despite headwinds and other uncertainties, it expected that to be the case in 2019.   “We believe this removes a key earnings concern,” Jefferies analyst Andrew Lee said in a note, maintaining a “buy” rating.  Over a 10-year period, Cathay’s second-half profit has averaged double or more than the first half due to seasonal differences, Slosar said.  Cathay is forecast to report a full-year profit of HK$4.3 billion, according to an average of 18 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.  Cathay’s first-half revenue rose 0.9% to HK$53.55 billion at a time when passenger capacity increased by 6.7%.   Passenger yields, a measure of the average fare per kilometer flown, fell 0.9% in the first half due to competition in premium classes and long-haul economy class.  Cargo revenue fell 11.4%.  Hong Kong is the world’s largest air freight hub and Cathay receives a higher proportion of revenue from cargo than peers like Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI) and Qantas Airways (QAN.AX).   The International Air Transport Association in June slashed its 2019 profit forecast for global airlines by 21%, partly due to the impact of the trade war on cargo revenue.  Cathay last month completed the purchase of low-cost airline Hong Kong Express from cash-strapped Chinese conglomerate HNA Group [HNAIRC.UL], giving Cathay its first foothold in a rapidly growing budget travel market in Asia.  Loo said Hong Kong Express could look to add destinations and lease or buy more planes but no firm plans had been set. 	Reuters

China’s consul general in Auckland praised the “spontaneous patriotism” of some Chinese students who opposed a group hanging Hong Kong independence posters at the University of Auckland.       Police said they were investigating the incident.  Foreign ministry officials met China’s representatives in New Zealand on Monday to reiterate that freedom of expression would be upheld and maintained, the website Newsroom said.  “The government has rebuked China over its recent comments and actions where it sought to suppress freedom of speech and voiced support for violent opposition to Hong Kong protesters in New Zealand,” it added.  A New Zealand foreign ministry spokeswoman confirmed the meeting but declined further comment. “Discussions took place,” she said in an email to Reuters.  China’s embassy in New Zealand and the foreign affairs ministry in Beijing did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.  Hong Kong is embroiled in its worst political crisis in decades after two months of increasingly violent protests that pose one of the gravest challenges to the Communist Party in Beijing.  Last week, the pro-Hong Kong students who held the protest at the University of Auckland got into an altercation with some mainland Chinese students, Newsroom reported, adding that one student from Hong Kong was pushed.  Protests in support of Hong Kong’s independence movement were held on other New Zealand campuses.  A statement posted on the Chinese consulate’s website last week condemned activities that were “demonizing the images of China” and “inciting anti-China sentiment”.  Asked about the incident on Monday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said academic freedom was very important and would be upheld “without interference from foreign entities or from government”.  New Zealand has had a rocky relationship with top trading partner China in recent months after it criticized Beijing’s lending to Pacific islands and its security agency blocked Chinese tech giant Huawei from the country’s first 5G network.

Millions have taken to Hong Kong streets in anti-government protests that have intensified since mid-June, at times forcing banks, stores, shopping malls, restaurants and even government buildings to close as the demonstrations degenerated into violent clashes between police and activists.  Hong Kong’s flagship airline, Cathay Pacific, said on Wednesday the protests reduced inbound passenger traffic in July and travelers were weighing on forward bookings, as it reported it swung to a half-year profit.  Thousands of protesters descended on the Chinese-ruled city’s airport in July, where some chanted “free Hong Kong” and others handed out flyers explaining the city’s crisis to tourists.  Protesters plan to rally at the airport again this weekend, potentially causing further disruptions after a strike on Monday saw more than 200 flights canceled.   The Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd (0045.HK), owner of the opulent Peninsula hotel in the bustling shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui, said it too was worried about the impact of the protests on tourist arrivals as well as the broader economy.  “We are concerned about the effect this political uncertainty may have on our results, especially given the proportion of our income which is earned in Hong Kong,” said Clement Kwok, CEO of the hotel group, in an earnings statement on Wednesday.  In June, Hong Kong-based cosmetic and healthcare products chain operator Bonjour Holdings Ltd (0653.HK) issued a profit warning which it partly blamed on the protests.   What started as an angry response to a now-suspended extradition bill, which would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial, now includes demands for greater democracy and the resignation of Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam.  Hong Kong retail sales, a key part of the city’s economy, felt a growing impact in June from the mass protests, falling 6.7% from a year earlier in the biggest decline since February.  Many businesses in Hong Kong are already facing strains from China’s economic slowdown, a weak Chinese yuan and fallout from the Sino-U.S. trade war.

Millions have taken to Hong Kong streets in anti-government protests that have intensified since mid-June, at times forcing banks, stores, shopping malls, restaurants and even government buildings to close as the demonstrations degenerated into violent clashes between police and activists.  Hong Kong’s flagship airline, Cathay Pacific, said on Wednesday the protests reduced inbound passenger traffic in July and travelers were weighing on forward bookings, as it reported it swung to a half-year profit.  Thousands of protesters descended on the Chinese-ruled city’s airport in July, where some chanted “free Hong Kong” and others handed out flyers explaining the city’s crisis to tourists.  Protesters plan to rally at the airport again this weekend, potentially causing further disruptions after a strike on Monday saw more than 200 flights canceled.   The Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd (0045.HK), owner of the opulent Peninsula hotel in the bustling shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui, said it too was worried about the impact of the protests on tourist arrivals as well as the broader economy.  “We are concerned about the effect this political uncertainty may have on our results, especially given the proportion of our income which is earned in Hong Kong,” said Clement Kwok, CEO of the hotel group, in an earnings statement on Wednesday.  In June, Hong Kong-based cosmetic and healthcare products chain operator Bonjour Holdings Ltd (0653.HK) issued a profit warning which it partly blamed on the protests.   What started as an angry response to a now-suspended extradition bill, which would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial, now includes demands for greater democracy and the resignation of Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam.  Hong Kong retail sales, a key part of the city’s economy, felt a growing impact in June from the mass protests, falling 6.7% from a year earlier in the biggest decline since February.  Many businesses in Hong Kong are already facing strains from China’s economic slowdown, a weak Chinese yuan and fallout from the Sino-U.S. trade war.

Hong Kong has suffered weeks of sometimes violent protests that began with opposition to a now-suspended extradition law, which would have allowed suspects to be tried in mainland courts.  But the protests have swelled into a broader backlash against the government of the Asian financial hub, fueled by many residents’ fear of eroding freedoms under the increasingly tight control of the Communist Party in Beijing.  “I would like to warn all of the criminals: don’t ever misjudge the situation and mistake our restraint for weakness,” the Chinese government’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said in a document issued during a briefing in Beijing.  A small group of violent radicals were at the forefront of the protests, with “some kind-hearted citizens who have been misguided and coerced to join,” according to the document attributed to two officials, Yang Guang and Xu Luying.   It said anti-China forces were the “behind-the-scenes masterminds” who had “openly and brazenly emboldened” the protesters.  “We would like to make clear to the very small group of unscrupulous and violent criminals and the dirty forces behind them: those who play with fire will perish by it,” the office said.  “At the end of the day, they will eventually be punished.”  China has been quick to label U.S. officials as “black hands” instigating unrest in Hong Kong in an attempt to contain China’s development, but it has not provided any concrete evidence.   A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers on Friday urged the Trump administration to suspend future sales of munitions and crowd-control equipment to Hong Kong police, which have been accused of using excessive force.    Police on Monday fired tear gas at protesters in the former British colony after a general strike hit transport and the city’s Beijing-backed leader, chief executive Carrie Lam, warned its prosperity was at risk.  The protests surpassed earlier shows of dissent in scale and intensity, seemingly stoked by Lam’s refusal once again to meet any of the protesters’ demands, including for her resignation and independent inquiries into police use of force.   The protests are the greatest political threat to Hong Kong’s government since the territory returned to Chinese rule in 1997, and one of the biggest popular challenges to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.  China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in Hong Kong has remained in barracks since the protests started in April, leaving Hong Kong’s police force to deal with the massive demonstrations.   Last week, the PLA garrison there issued a video showing “anti-riot” exercises, and its top brass warned violence is “absolutely impermissible”.   Diplomats and foreign security analysts are watching the situation closely, but believe there’s little appetite in Beijing for the PLA to be deployed on the streets of Hong Kong.  So far, the central government and the PLA have said only that there are clear provisions in law covering the prospect of the force’s intervention in the city.   During the briefing, Yang called the PLA “a strong force that defends every inch of its sacred territory”, and said the central government would not allow any “turbulence” beyond the control of the Hong Kong government to threaten national unity or security.   “The PLA is a force of power but also a civilized power,” Yang said.  “As long as it has the strong support of the central government and the Chinese people, the Hong Kong government and police “are fully capable of punishing those criminal activities and restoring public order and stability”, he said.

The three activists, who declined to give their real names, held the news conference in the Mong Kok neighborhood of Hong Kong. Representatives of the protest movement have not held any news conferences since the demonstrations began two months ago.  “We call on the government to return the power back to the people and to address the demands of Hong Kong citizens,” one activist said during the news conference shown on several TV channels in Hong Kong.  The activists were speaking a day after police fired tear gas at protesters in multiple parts of Hong Kong in the most widespread and intense violence to rock the city in decades.  The news conference reflected the faceless and leaderless ethos of the protests, partly an effort by participants to avoid prosecution by the authorities.  One of the activists said that the group “was not affiliated with any political party or organization leading the movement”.  But the group said their initiative was prompted by Lam’s announcement that the police would hold daily news conferences. The aim was to provide a platform for Hong Kong citizens to voice dissatisfaction with the government and the police, they said.  Hong Kong’s government had failed to take responsibility for the outcry gripping the city, one activist said.  He urged the government to respond to the protesters’ demands: a complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as “rioting”; a waiver of charges against those arrested; an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.  The protests started over an extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial but have now morphed into a broader backlash against the city’s government and the central government of China.    The group also reiterated demands for an investigation into police actions and attacks by suspected triad gangsters on civilians on July 21.  “We strongly condemn the police for the series of violent acts and urge them and the government not to be enemies against the public,” the activist said, adding it was the police’s duty to serve and protect civilians.  In a statement on Monday, the government condemned the protesters’ acts, saying they had undermined law and order and seriously affected economic activities.

The strike comes after another weekend of violent protests, which the government said were pushing the city to “an extremely dangerous edge”.  Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said she would hold a news conference at 10 a.m. local time (0200 GMT) on Monday.  Police said on Monday they arrested 44 people after sometimes violent clashes overnight when police fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators who moved swiftly across the city in flash mob-style actions.  The Chinese-controlled city has been rocked by months of protests that began against an extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial and have since evolved into calls for greater democracy.  The protests have at times shut government offices, blocked roads and disrupted business, posing the greatest political challenge to the former British colony since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  Millions of people have taken to the streets to vent anger and frustration at the city’s government, presenting the biggest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.  Rail operator MTR Corp announced the suspension of services between the bustling shopping district of Causeway Bay and Quarry Bay on Hong Kong island. Services from Kowloon Tong to stations close to the border with mainland China were also disrupted, Hong Kong media reported.  The Labour Department urged employers to show understanding and flexibility for employees’ work arrangements due to traffic conditions. 	Reuters

U.S. President Donald Trump vowed on Thursday to slap a 10% tariff on $300 billion of Chinese imports from next month, sharply escalating a trade dispute between the world’s biggest economies.  In unusually blunt remarks for a United Nations’ diplomat from China, Zhang Jun described Trump’s move as “an irrational, irresponsible act” and urged Washington to “come back to the right track.” He also said Beijing was prepared to take countermeasures.  “China’s position is very clear that if U.S. wishes to talk, then we will talk, if they want to fight, then we will fight,” Zhang said. “We definitely will take whatever necessary countermeasures to protect our fundamental right, and we also urge the United States to come back to the right track in finding the right solution through the right way.”  Zhang served as an assistant minister for foreign affairs in Beijing before beginning his role as U.N. ambassador this week. He spoke to a small group of reporters at U.N. headquarters.   When asked if China’s trade relations with the United States could harm cooperation between the countries to deal with North Korea, Zhang said it was difficult to predict.   But he added: “It will be hard to imagine that on the one hand you are seeking the cooperation from your partner, and on the other hand you are hurting the interests of your partner.”  As North Korea’s ally and neighbor, China has played a key role in agreeing to and enforcing U.N. Security Council sanctions on Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  Since Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met for the first time a year ago, China has signaled Pyongyang should be encouraged and that “at an appropriate time” sanctions should be eased. He added that China had not decided when that should be.   “You cannot simply ask DPRK to do as much as possible while you maintain the sanctions against DPRK, that definitely is not helpful,” he said, using North Korea’s official name - the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.   Zhang also said that while he was very willing to cooperate with other U.N. member states, China would never allow interference in the country’s “internal affairs, especially on issues related to Xinjiang, Tibet, and to Hong Kong.”  China has been widely condemned for setting up detention complexes in remote Xinjiang, where the U.N. says at least 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained. Beijing describes them as “education training centers” helping to stamp out extremism and give people new skills.  In Hong Kong, protests against a proposed bill that would allow people to be extradited to stand trial in mainland China have grown increasingly violent, with police accused of excessive use of force and failing to protect protesters from suspected gang attacks.  “The demonstration has gone far beyond the nature of a peaceful demonstration, it’s really turning out to be chaotic and violent and we should no longer allow them to continue this reprehensible behavior,” Zhang said.

The story, which was published late last week, was not visible on the Eikon terminal’s scrolling news feed in China on Friday. Eikon users outside China said they could still see the story. Reuters was unable to determine precisely when the story had been removed from Eikon’s scrolling news feed for clients in China or whether other stories had been blocked.  Refinitiv has a license to provide financial information in China, and a person familiar with the matter said Refinitiv’s regulator there, the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC, had said it would shut down the service unless it removed or blocked certain political stories.   The person, who asked not to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter, said Refinitiv had agreed to block some political news from its platform in mainland China.  “As a global business, we comply with all our local regulatory obligations, including the requirements of our license to operate in China,” Refinitiv said in a written statement to Reuters.  The CAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In June, Reuters reported that Refinitiv, under pressure from China’s government, had removed from Eikon several Reuters stories related to the 30th anniversary of the violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.  Refinitiv removed the Tiananmen stories after a similar warning from the CAC, people with knowledge of the action said at the time.  “Reuters reports around the world in a fair, unbiased and independent manner, in keeping with the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles, and we stand by our China coverage,” a Reuters spokesman said. “We continue to provide Refinitiv with the same scope of content that we always have, including stories relating to China, and Refinitiv’s decisions will not affect the breadth or quality of our coverage.”  In June, Reuters President Michael Friedenberg and Editor-in-Chief Steve Adler said the news organization had spoken to Refinitiv and expressed its concern about the earlier action to block Reuters stories about the Tiananmen anniversary.   In a memo to staff on Friday, they said Reuters’ position had not changed and that they stood by last week’s story.  “The story - which concerns the protests in Hong Kong - is fair and accurate, and we stand by our reporting. We have expressed our concern and disappointment to Refinitiv that this has happened again,” they said.  Refinitiv was formed last year when Reuters News’ parent company Thomson Reuters Corp (TRI.TO)(TRI.N) sold a 55% stake in its Financial & Risk (F&R) unit to a group led by private equity firm Blackstone Group LP.  On Thursday, London Stock Exchange (LSE.L) announced a $27 billion deal to buy Refinitiv.  Reuters News, a unit of Thomson Reuters, supplies news to Refinitiv under a 30-year agreement that pays Reuters a minimum of $325 million per year, making Refinitiv the news organization’s largest customer.  Reuters also provides news for media and digital clients, and their access to stories was not affected.  Censorship in China has been intensifying under President Xi Jinping, and businesses have come under growing pressure to block content that Beijing sees as sensitive.  This is an especially sensitive year for China. In addition to the June 4th Tiananmen anniversary, the country will on Oct. 1 mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.  Hong Kong has been plunged into its biggest political crisis since the former British colony’s return to Chinese rule in 1997. A wave of protests has engulfed Hong Kong since the introduction of a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party controlled courts.   The Reuters story blocked by Refinitiv reported that an official from China’s representative office had used a July 11 banquet for hundreds of villagers in Hong Kong’s rural New Territories to urge residents to protect their towns in the Yuen Long district and to drive away protesters.  On July 21, after anti-government protesters marched in central Hong Kong and defaced China’s Liaison Office, more than 100 men swarmed through Yuen Long train station, attacking black-clad protesters and others with pipes and clubs. Forty-five people were injured, one critically.  In a statement released on its website last Friday, China’s Liaison Office rejected what it called false rumors linking it to the violence in Yuen Long, although the statement did not mention Reuters directly or address the speech reported by Reuters.

The story, which was published late last week, was not visible on the Eikon terminal’s scrolling news feed in China on Friday. Eikon users outside China said they could still see the story. Reuters was unable to determine precisely when the story had been removed from Eikon’s scrolling news feed for clients in China or whether other stories had been blocked.  Refinitiv has a license to provide financial information in China, and a person familiar with the matter said Refinitiv’s regulator there, the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC, had said it would shut down the service unless it removed or blocked certain political stories.  The person, who asked not to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter, said Refinitiv had agreed to block some political news from its platform in mainland China.  “As a global business, we comply with all our local regulatory obligations, including the requirements of our license to operate in China,” Refinitiv said in a written statement to Reuters.  The CAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In June, Reuters reported that Refinitiv, under pressure from China’s government, had removed from Eikon several Reuters stories related to the 30th anniversary of the violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.  Refinitiv removed the Tiananmen stories after a similar warning from the CAC, people with knowledge of the action said at the time.  “Reuters reports around the world in a fair, unbiased and independent manner, in keeping with the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles, and we stand by our China coverage,” a Reuters spokesman said. “We continue to provide Refinitiv with the same scope of content that we always have, including stories relating to China, and Refinitiv’s decisions will not affect the breadth or quality of our coverage.”  In June, Reuters President Michael Friedenberg and Editor-in-Chief Steve Adler said the news organisation had spoken to Refinitiv and expressed its concern about the earlier action to block Reuters stories about the Tiananmen anniversary. They urged staff to “continue reporting as you always would: to pursue the truth, without fear or favour.”  Refinitiv was formed last year when Reuters News’ parent company Thomson Reuters Corp sold a 55% stake in its Financial & Risk (F&R) unit to a group led by private equity firm Blackstone Group LP.  On Thursday, London Stock Exchange announced a $27 billion deal to buy Refinitiv.  Reuters News, a unit of Thomson Reuters, supplies news to Refinitiv under a 30-year agreement that pays Reuters a minimum of $325 million per year, making Refinitiv the news organization’s largest customer.  Reuters also provides news for media and digital clients, and their access to stories was not affected.  Censorship in China has been intensifying under President Xi Jinping, and businesses have come under growing pressure to block content that Beijing sees as sensitive.  This is an especially sensitive year for China. In addition to the June 4th Tiananmen anniversary, the country will on Oct. 1 mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.  Hong Kong has been plunged into its biggest political crisis since the former British colony’s return to Chinese rule in 1997. A wave of protests has engulfed Hong Kong since the introduction of a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party controlled courts.  The Reuters story blocked by Refinitiv reported that an official from China’s representative office had used a July 11 banquet for hundreds of villagers in Hong Kong’s rural New Territories to urge residents to protect their towns in the Yuen Long district and to drive away protesters.  On July 21, after anti-government protesters marched in central Hong Kong and defaced China’s Liaison Office, more than 100 men swarmed through Yuen Long train station, attacking black-clad protesters and others with pipes and clubs. Forty-five people were injured, one critically. 	Reuters

Millions have taken to the streets in the past three months to protest against an extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.    The protests are the most serious political crisis in Hong Kong since it returned to China 22 years ago. They also pose the greatest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012 and come as Xi already grapples with a Sino-U.S. trade war and tensions in the South China Sea.   Some activists have waved the U.S. flag during the demonstrations, while Beijing has accused U.S. officials of being behind the violent chaos and warned against interference.   Trump was asked by reporters before leaving for a campaign event in Ohio on Thursday whether he was concerned by media reports that China might intervene in Hong Kong and said the city had experienced “riots for a long period of time”.  “Hong Kong is a part of China, they’ll have to deal with that themselves,” he said.  Trump’s labeling of the demonstrations as riots is certain to rile activists in the Asian financial center who have called on the city’s government to drop the use of the word to describe the protests.   On Wednesday, 44 people were charged with rioting for their role in one recent protest that turned violent when thousands of activists clashed with police near Beijing’s main representative office in the city.  Rioting is defined under Hong Kong law as an unlawful assembly of three or more people where any person commits a breach of the peace. A conviction can carry a 10-year prison sentence.  Trump said earlier this month he believed Xi had acted  responsibly with the Hong Kong protests and that “China could stop them if they wanted”.  Thousands of civil servants are planning to rally on Friday night in support of the protesters and to urge authorities to rebuild confidence in the government, with more demonstrations planned for the weekend.   What started out as protests against the extradition bill have evolved into a broader backlash against the Hong Kong government and its political master in Beijing. 	Reuters

The trade war between the world’s two largest economies has raised costs, roiled financial markets and has also triggered analyst concerns about its impact on global banks that handle the bulk of the trade finance related businesses.  Adding to the woes is the reversal in the cycle of rising interest rates, with Hong Kong, which accounts for a bulk of StanChart revenue, cutting its base rate on Thursday for the first time since 2008, after the U.S. Federal Reserve’s downward move.  “Concerns surrounding the potential escalation of trade tensions has affected sentiment and central banks’ commentary is indicating a reversal of monetary policy normalization,” said  StanChart Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford in a statement.  Pretax profit for StanChart, which focuses on Asia, Africa and the Middle East, increased 3% to $2.41 billion in the January-June period from $2.35 billion in the same period last year, the bank said in the statement to the stock exchange.  The latest profit compared with the $2.23 billion average of 11 analyst estimates compiled by Standard Chartered.  The global impact of the trade tensions will “continue to reverberate” throughout 2019, StanChart said.  CEO Bill Winters said in an earnings call that the impact of the trade friction had been “pretty limited” so far.  “But we all recognize that this could get worse, the tariffs could be expanded. Corporations in the U.S., China and elsewhere are responding to not just what’s happening but what could happen,” he said.  Citigroup (C.N) last month said trade tensions have discouraged some corporate customers from taking out loans.        U.S. and Chinese negotiators ended a brief round of trade talks on Wednesday with little sign of progress and agreed to meet again in September, prolonging an uneasy truce in a year-long trade war.  StanChart also said that “recent political protests have additionally elevated the risk” in Hong Kong, referring to a  wave of protests in the financial hub against a now suspended extradition bill that would see people sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party controlled courts.  “The Hong Kong situation obviously is more fragile at this particular point in time,” Halford said. While the bank has not seen any direct impact of that on its business, sentiment has been impacted a little bit, he added.  StanChart’s London shares rose 3% after results were unveiled, the best performer on the FTSE 350 banks index .FTNMX8350, tracking gains in its Hong Kong-listed shares.   StanChart has been making steady progress in its turnaround strategy and, in a sign of confidence about its prospects of growing revenues, the bank in April unveiled plans for an up to $1 billion share buyback, its first such in at least 20 years.  That came after Winters unveiled in February ambitious plans to double return on tangible equity and dividends in three years by cutting $700 million in costs and boosting income.  Winters’ turnaround strategy involves reducing costs, exiting low-return businesses, increasing investments on technology and sharpening focus on products and markets to become competitive and improve profitability.  The bank’s return on tangible equity rose 88 basis points to 8.4 percent at end-June, the statement showed, and StanChart said it was confident its new strategy would help deliver a full-year return on tangible equity greater than 10% in 2021.  StanChart said its core capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, fell by 68 basis points from end-December last year to 13.5% after factoring in a 39-basis points impact due to the up to $1 billion share buyback program.  It cut its operating expenses by 2.9% in the first half of the year to $5 billion, compared to the same period last year, but said second-half costs are expected to be slightly higher than the first half mainly due to technology investments.  StanChart has become the latest British firm to face protest from shareholders over executive pensions after the bank’s 2019 directors remuneration report set out plans to increase Winters’ pension allowance among other measures.  Winters on Thursday said the bank’s board was consulting with shareholders on executive compensation at StanChart, and that he would “happily accept” the result of that process. 	Reuters
660	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1UP0TK	July 30, 2019 /  8:50 AM / in 8 months	'We may lose Christmas': escalating Hong Kong protests taking bigger toll on shops, economy	HONG KONG (Reuters) - Months of increasingly violent protests in Hong Kong are taking a growing toll on the city’s economy, weighing on confidence and scaring away tourists from one of the world’s most vibrant shopping destinations.  Economists say the impact of anti-government protests over the past eight weeks is already worse than in 2014, when a so-called “Umbrella revolution” paralyzed the city’s financial district for 79 days.  Demonstrations are more spread out across the city this time and violence has been more intense, prompting local and foreign shoppers to avoid certain areas. Stores and even bank branches have been forced to close for prolonged periods.  Many businesses in the port city on the southern Chinese coast are already facing strains from China’s economic slowdown and fallout from the year-long Sino-U.S. trade war.  Various strikes are planned in coming weeks, while disruptive civil disobedience actions are taking place almost daily and look set to continue for months. On Tuesday, hundreds of protesters blocked train services, causing commuter chaos.   The main retail association has warned members expect a double-digit drop in sales in July and August. The government will release June sales data on Thursday.  “Hong Kong’s retail industry will be affected both internally and externally,” said Angela Cheng, economist at CMB International Capital Corporation Limited, adding she had revised her 2019 retail sales forecast to as much as a 10% drop, twice as deep as her previous estimate.  Brokerage CLSA downgraded local jeweler Chow Tai Fook, one of the city’s most popular brands with mainland tourists, to ‘sell’ from ‘outperform’ on July 23, saying the protests could cause permanent long-term damage.  Luxury group Richemont warned in July that protests hurt its sales, while Swiss watchmaker Swatch said political turbulence contributed to a double-digit decline in sales in Hong Kong, one of its most important markets globally.  Around the Admiralty district, where much of the protests have centered, staff at several restaurants and shops told Reuters on Monday that patrons have dropped by a third from a month earlier.   Bobby Tang, a 21-year-old sales representative at a Gucci store in the Causeway Bay shopping district, where protest barricades were raised for the first time on Sunday, supports the civil movement.   He says the government has failed to respond to any of its demands, which at first were focused on withdrawing a controversial China extradition bill, but have morphed into a much wider pro-democracy struggle.  But he also worries about his job at the French luxury group. Prior to the protests, the store had one client per minute, he said, but now it was 3-4 per hour and daily sales have fallen to HK$20,000 ($2,560) from HK$100,000.    “If the protests last until October, I worry if I can earn enough salary,” Tang said.   Shopping malls are often being used for rest breaks by protesters wearing helmets and goggles and sometimes carrying makeshift weapons.  The protesters have been largely respectful of the premises, but on one occasion one mall turned into a battle ground. As police tried to disperse crowds in the Sha Tin working class district on July 14, it ended up chasing them into a shopping center managed by Sun Hung Kai Properties.   Fighting erupted and scenes of regular shoppers with bulky bags running away while trying to maintain balance on bloody, slippery floors were broadcast worldwide.   Tourism, especially from mainland China, has dropped markedly. Britain, Japan, Singapore and others have issued travel alerts.  Hong Kong’s Federation of Trade Unions said hotel occupancy rates fell 20% in June year-on-year, and probably 40% in July.  A local tour manager who gave only his surname Yu said around two-thirds of his mainland clients have canceled bookings.  LONG-TERM RISKS      Fitch Ratings said in a note on Tuesday the unrest could damage business confidence and the quality of governance. It also raised longer-term concerns about policy paralysis and erosion of the rule of law.  A 1992 U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act allowing Washington to have a different customs regime with Hong Kong than with mainland China was also crucial for the stability of the Chinese-ruled city.  For it to stand, U.S. authorities need to see Hong Kong as sufficiently independent from Beijing, therefore they will scrutinize the latter’s every step during the protests.  Fitch affirmed Hong Kong’s AA+ rating on June 11.   “Evidence of a permanent loss of confidence in public institutions or tangible reduction of the territory’s semi-autonomy as granted under the Basic Law, would ... be grounds to review the ratings,” Fitch said.  The American Chamber of Commerce warned that international businesses were feeling pessimistic on short-term prospects and that the government should take immediate actions to address the root causes of the demonstrations.   “The protests have a chance to last until the end of the year. We may even lose on Christmas, which should be the best sales season,” said Fung, a sales assistant for a skin care company who only gave her last name. 	Reuters

Closely watched like-for-like sales rose 2.6% in the second quarter, accelerating from a 2.2% rise recorded in the three months between January and March, which marked the first increase after 10 quarters of falls.  Chief Executive Micaela Le Divelec Lemmi, a former Gucci executive appointed to head Ferragamo a year ago, has been seeking to revamp the leather goods brand by focusing on new products and digital communication.    In the first six months, total revenues increased 4.4% at constant exchange rates to 705 million euros ($786 million), a touch above analyst estimates.       Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose by 2.1% over the period to 119 million euros.  Analysts had expected 701 million euros in sales and 122 million euros in adjusted core earnings, according to Refinitiv’s SmartEstimates.  The company said on Tuesday it expected results in the second half of the year to be in line with the first half.   Chief Financial Officer Alessandro Corsi said in a conference it was “feasible” to meet forecasts it had compiled from analysts of 1.390 billion euros in revenues for 2019, up 3.2 % from a year earlier, and about 220 million for full-year EBITDA.  Refinitiv and other analysts’ estimates for the full year are slightly above these figures, at 1.4 billion for sales and around 230 million for EBITDA.  Sales growth in the first half of year was driven by Asia, Ferragamo’s main market, and in particular by China where the retail channel rose 16.3% at constant rates.  Le Divelec Lemmi said the group had seen a negative impact from protests in Hong Kong, a sensitive market for the group, at the end of June and in July. She said it was hard to estimate the demonstrations could affect regional sales.  The wholesale channel posted a strong performance in the first half of the year although U.S. department stores remained weak. In terms of product categories, handbags and fragrances outperformed footwear.  (This story was refiled to edit headline) 	Reuters

Airfares will rise by a modest 1.2% and hotel rates by 1.3% in U.S. dollar terms and an average of about 2.2% for both in local currencies, said the annual business travel forecast from Carlson Wagonlit Travel (CWT) and the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) released on Wednesday.  “We have seen over the last few years that the economy has been growing at a very stable rate. That was the case in 2018 as well,” CWT Senior Director of Asia Pacific Multinational Sales Akshay Kapoor told Reuters in an interview.   However, the outlook has become more questionable in 2019, and the economic uncertainty is expected to continue next year, he added.  Global trade expanded by just 0.5% in the first quarter of 2019, marking the slowest year-on-year pace of growth since 2012 amid signs a more significant slowdown is possible, International Monetary Fund officials said last week, lowering the growth forecast for this year and next.  The International Air Transport Association (IATA) in June forecast passenger yields, a proxy for airfares, would be flat this year after a 2.1% drop in 2018.  Germany’s Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) on Tuesday posted a decline in second-quarter earnings, hurt by price competition on short-haul routes and rising fuel costs, adding the European market would likely remain challenging until at least the year’s end.   In Asia, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (0293.HK) has also warned yields will be under pressure in the coming months as performance in North America and Europe lags expectations due to intense competition.  An anti-government campaign in Hong Kong that led to protests so far had only a minimal impact on business travel bookings, although some companies were starting to tell employees to defer non-essential travel or cancel plans to visit the city, Kapoor said.  “The businesses are in a kind of look-and-see mode at the point in time,” he said. “We are not seeing a major decline or any of that.”  The global hotel market has been hit by the same weakening in economic growth as airlines, with Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) and Wyndham Hotels and Resorts Inc (WH.N) last week lowering their forecast ranges for revenue rises in 2019.  CWT and GBTA expect a 2.3% rise in North American hotel rates next year, but a 0.4% decline in Latin America and more modest growth in Europe and Asia in U.S. dollar terms. 	Reuters

It was the first time the rioting charge has been used during protests which erupted over an extradition bill that would have allowed people in Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China for trial. Another man was charged with possession of an offensive weapon.  Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets on Sunday as they sought to defend China’s main representative office from protesters who set up road blocks and hurled bricks and sticks.  What started three months ago as rallies against the extradition bill, has evolved into a wider backlash against the city’s government and its political masters in Beijing.  The near daily protests have disrupted business, piled pressure on the city’s government and stretched its police force, which some have accused of using excessive force.  Hundreds of protesters gathered at the Kwai Chung police station where some of the activists were to be freed on bail. Clashes broke out between the protesters and police. One officer brandished a gun to ward off the crowd.  Rioting carries a maximum ten year jail term in Hong Kong. Activists say they have done nothing wrong and are only seeking justice. In the driving rain, many chanted “Liberate Hong Kong,” and “Revolution of our time”.   Besides calling for the extradition bill to be scrapped, rather than its suspension so far, protesters have also demanded the resignation of city leader Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into the police’s handling of the crisis and the unconditional release of all those arrested.  Some of the activists are due to appear in court on Wednesday.   Earlier in the day, protesters blocked train services during the morning rush hour.  “We don’t know how long we are going to stay here, we don’t have a leader, as you can see this is a mass movement now,” said Sharon, a 21-year-old masked protester who declined to give her full name.   “It’s not our intention to inconvenience people, but we have to make the authorities understand why we protest. We will continue with this as long as needed.”   By mid-morning, commuters were crammed into stations across the city, waiting to board trains that were delayed, with no service on some lines.   Hong Kong, which returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997, is embroiled in its worst political crisis for decades as the increasingly violent protests pose one of the gravest populist challenges to Communist Party rulers in Beijing.  China on Monday reiterated its support for Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam and its police and urged Hong Kong’s people to oppose violence.  Lam’s popularity has dropped to a record low, according to a survey by the independent Public Opinion Research Institute released on Tuesday.  The survey, conducted between July 17 and July 19, showed Lam scored a rating of 30.1, down from 33.4 at the beginning of the month. Her approval rate stands at 21%, while her disapproval rate is 70%.  Over the last few years, many people in Hong Kong have become concerned about the whittling away of the city’s freedoms, guaranteed under a “one country, two systems” formula established when it returned to China in 1997.  China denies interfering and has said the protests are an “undisguised challenge” to the formula under which the city is ruled, and risked damaging its economy. 	Reuters

As police tried to disperse crowds in the Sha Tin working class district on July 14, it ended up chasing them into a shopping centre managed by Sun Hung Kai Properties.  Fighting erupted and scenes of regular shoppers with bulky bags running away while trying to maintain balance on bloody, slippery floors were broadcast worldwide.  Tourism, especially from mainland China, has dropped markedly. Britain, Japan, Singapore and others have issued travel alerts.  Hong Kong’s Federation of Trade Unions said hotel occupancy rates fell 20% in June year-on-year, and probably 40% in July.  A local tour manager who gave only his surname Yu said around two-thirds of his mainland clients have cancelled bookings.  LONG-TERM RISKS  Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday the unrest could damage business confidence and the quality of governance. It also raised longer-term concerns about policy paralysis and erosion of the rule of law.  A 1992 U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act allowing Washington to have a different customs regime with Hong Kong than with mainland China was also crucial for the stability of the Chinese-ruled city.  For it to stand, U.S. authorities need to see Hong Kong as sufficiently independent from Beijing, therefore they will scrutinise the latter’s every step during the protests.  The American Chamber of Commerce warned that international businesses were feeling pessimistic on short-term prospects and that the government should take immediate actions to address the root causes of the demonstrations.

What started three months ago as rallies against an extradition bill that would have allowed people in Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China for trial, has now morphed into a wider backlash against the city’s government and its political masters in Beijing.  Protests have occurred almost daily, sometimes with little notice, disrupting business, piling pressure on Hong Kong’s beleaguered government and stretching the city’s police force, which some have accused of using excessive force.  Activists blocked train doors, playing havoc with services and forcing hundreds of people to stream out of railway stations in search of alternative transport.  “We don’t know how long we are going to stay here, we don’t have a leader, as you can see this is a mass movement now,” said Sharon, a 21-year-old masked protester who declined to give her full name. “It’s not our intention to inconvenience people, but we have to make the authorities understand why we protest. We will continue with this as long as need.”  Others chanted, “Liberate Hong Kong,” and “Revolution of our Time”.  Rail operator MTR Corp said some services had been disrupted and urged people to seek other forms of transport.  Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997, is embroiled in its worst political crisis for decades after two months of increasingly violent protests that have posed one of the gravest populist challenges to Communist Party rulers in Beijing.  China on Monday reiterated its support for Hong Kong’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, and its police and urged Hong Kong people to oppose violence.  The latest protest follows a demonstration at the Chinese-ruled city’s international airport on Friday and violent protests at the weekend when activists clashed with police who fired rubber bullets, tear gas and sponge grenades - a crowd-control weapon.  Minor scuffles broke out between protesters and commuters as some grew frustrated over the train stoppage.  “It’s so inconvenient and annoying, really. I am in hurry to work, to make a living. Will you give away your salary to me?” said a 64-year-old man surnamed Liu. 	Reuters
667	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1UO032	July 29, 2019 /  1:31 AM / in 8 months	Beijing reiterates support for Hong Kong's Lam, police	BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China reiterated on Monday its support for Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, and its police, and called on Hong Kong people to oppose violence following another weekend of clashes between protesters and police in the city.  Hong Kong bore the scars on Monday of its eighth straight weekend of violent protests, with hard hats, umbrellas and water bottles littering some central streets.  Huge crowds have taken to the streets to protest against a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to China to face trial in Communist Party-controlled courts.   The protests have at times paralyzed parts of the financial district, shut government offices and disrupted business operations across the city. Officials have also warned about the impact of the unrest on Hong Kong’s economy.  Beijing has stood by the city’s leader Lam, and the Chinese government’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, which has cabinet-level authority over the former British colony, reiterated that support at a news conference in Beijing.  “The central government firmly supports Carrie Lam leading the Hong Kong government’s administration according to law, firmly supports the Hong Kong police strictly enforcing rule of law,” Yang Guang, a spokesman for the office, told the news conference.  “We especially appreciate and empathize with Hong Kong police forces and their families for the huge pressure they are bearing,” he said.    The most important thing was for Hong Kong to handle the unrest according to the law, Yang said, blaming “irresponsible people” in the West for stirring up trouble in a bid to “contain China’s development”.  Such efforts would fail, he said.  The briefing was the first held by the office specifically to address the Hong Kong protests, and a moderator at times chided journalists who shouted out questions, telling them not to interrupt.  Yang, asked under what conditions the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) could intervene, referred, as other officials have done, to Hong Kong’s mini constitution, known as the Basic Law, which states that the Hong Kong government can ask the PLA garrison in the city to help maintain order.  Yang said Hong Kong’s government and society needed to find more effective ways to help young people address concerns over housing, employment and other issues, although officials did not announce any specific measures to address the unrest.  The protests are the most serious political crisis in Hong Kong since it returned to China 22 years ago. They also pose the greatest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.   Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that promised wide-ranging freedoms denied to citizens in mainland China.  Many fear Beijing is increasingly chipping away at those freedoms.      The past weekend saw more clashes between protesters and police, who again fired rubber bullets and tear gas as the demonstrations grow increasingly violent.   Police sought to defend China’s main representative office in Hong Kong from protesters on Sunday for the second consecutive weekend, with the building near the heart of the city fortified with barricades.  Police said they had arrested at least 49 people over Sunday’s protests for offences including unauthorized assembly and possession of offensive weapons.  What began as a movement to oppose the extradition law has taken on broader demands. They include Lam’s resignation, calls for full democracy, and an independent inquiry into what some say has been excessive force used by police against protesters.  Lam has refused to accede to any of the demands.  The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said on Monday that, according to a recent survey, international businesses were pessimistic about the short-term prospects for the city due to escalating violence and political deadlock.   Respondents reported a deepening perception within their companies and among overseas customers that Hong Kong had become less safe and a riskier place in which to conduct business, it said.  A series of protests are planned over coming weeks and the outlook is increasingly uncertain.   Labour Party lawmaker Fernando Cheung, who has tried to mediate between activists and police, told Reuters Lam needed to heed demands to withdraw the extradition bill and set up an independent commission, among other requests.   “Short of that, we would only be spiraling down toward even more violence, death, a curfew and even PLA interference,” Cheung said.

Engel said in a statement on Friday that he was “deeply concerned” by reports of police brutality in Hong Kong and criticized Beijing’s “increasingly harsh responses and propagandic depictions” of the protesters.  China’s Foreign Ministry Office in Hong Kong responded on Sunday with a sharply-worded statement, saying it “urges foreign politicians to stop sending the wrong signals over this violent behaviour”.  “What are the qualifications of American politicians to criticise Hong Kong’s human rights, freedoms and the rule of law?” it said.   It’s the latest in a series of sharp rebukes by China aimed at U.S. and UK politicians who have criticized Hong Kong authorities’ responses to the protests, as well as Beijing’s growing influence in the independently governed city.  The Hong Kong protests, which have surged again in recent days, were initially against an extradition bill that would allow people to be sent to mainland China, but have since broadened into calls for wider democratic reforms.  Protesters are also seeking independent inquiries into police use of force and are calling for the resignation of Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam.  China recently said it believes U.S. officials were behind the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and asked the United States to “withdraw their black hands”. 	Reuters

Students at Brisbane’s University of Queensland gathered this week to show support for demonstrations in Hong Kong led by pro-democracy activists who object to what they see as Beijing’s growing influence over the financial hub.  Rival students turned up to show support for Beijing, with some playing nationalistic songs and chanting “China is great”, media reported. Footage posted on social media showed some shouting between the two groups and some punches thrown.  China’s consul-general in Brisbane, Xu Jie, praised the pro-Beijing students for confronting what he said were “anti-China separatist” protesters with “ulterior motives”, the Australian newspaper reported on Saturday.  Payne said in a statement the right to free speech was protected in Australia “even on contentious and sensitive issues”.  “The government would be particularly concerned if any foreign diplomatic mission were to act in ways that could undermine such rights, including by encouraging disruptive or potentially violent behavior,” she said.  The former British colony of Hong Kong is embroiled in its worst political crisis for decades after two months of increasingly violent protests that have posed one of the gravest challenges to Communist Party rulers in Beijing.  Hong Kong returned to China under a “one country, two systems” formula in 1997, guaranteeing its freedoms, including rights to protest not enjoyed on the mainland. But many in Hong Kong resent what they see as Beijing’s creeping control.  China denies interfering in Hong Kong and has warned that the protests over a proposed law allowing extraditions to mainland China were an “undisguised challenge”.  The Chinese government has also accused outside powers of stirring up the Hong Kong protests.  Xu, the consul-general in Brisbane, praised the “spontaneous patriotic behavior” of the pro-Beijing students.  “The consulate general ... resolutely opposes the words and deeds of any separatist countries, and opposes the use of these events to create the opposition between Chinese and Hong Kong students and ­incite anti-China sentiment,” the Australian quoted Xu as saying.

The industry has so far largely shrugged off any fallout from a Beijing-Washington trade war that could potentially hit  consumer sentiment in its two biggest markets, with appetite for branded goods if anything picking among Chinese shoppers.   Hermes - along with Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (LVMH.PA) and Gucci parent Kering (PRTP.PA), which are also due to report results this week - has been one of the big beneficiaries of this benign backdrop.   The French company, best known for its pricey leather goods and squared silk scarves, said sales for the April to June period grew 14.7% on a reported basis to 1.67 billion euros ($1.87 billion), and were up 12.3% at stable exchange rates.   That marked a pick-up from the 11.6% comparable sales growth  a quarter earlier, when several analysts had expected a slightly more muted performance, citing a tougher comparison base.   Revenues expanded at a brisk pace across Asia, accelerating from the quarter before in spite of political protests in Hong Kong, a big regional shopping destination.   Hermes finance chief Eric du Halgouet told reporters the company had to close two of its Hong Kong stores at certain points in June due to the demonstrations, but that the drag on sales was minor.   Chinese shoppers, who makes up more than a third of the luxury goods industry’s client base, have been increasingly spending at home rather than overseas, encouraged by government measures such as import tariff cuts.   Hermes said sales in continental China, where it recently revamped its e-commerce site, were particularly strong in the first half of 2019. It has just rebooted its online shopping site in Japan and will extend the overhaul to Singapore and Malaysia this year, du Halgouet said.   Hermes said operating margins for the six months to the end of June would be slightly below the record 34.5% reached in the first half of 2018, dampened by unfavorable exchange rate hedges, used to protect firms against currency swings.  It reports full results for the first half of the year on Sept. 11.   	Reuters

Soft drink Pocari Sweat is caught in a firestorm after it pulled television ads in apparent support of Hong Kong protests. Such statements can pay off for brands that have political influence, or stand to win more friends than enemies. With Beijing involved, neither is usually the case.  Pocari, a sports drink owned by Otsuka Holdings, earned brownie points from protesters by ending a partnership with TVB when the channel was accused of a pro-Beijing bias - a charge the outlet denies. Little known outside Asia, the tangy drink is now a regular fixture at sweltering summer marches.   But the campaign has fallen flat. Such strategies are polarising; Pocari won fans in Hong Kong, but after a backlash from Chinese state media, the brand distanced itself from the earlier statements.   Companies globally are becoming bolder in taking principled stands. Take Nike - the shoemaker supported U.S. footballer Colin Kaepernick’s fight against racism, making him the face of a marketing campaign last year. Media giants Netflix, Disney and WarnerMedia have threatened to stop working in the state of Georgia if strict abortion rules go ahead.  But the conditions where this can work are pretty specific. In Nike’s case, courting controversy was a way to charm consumers: a Reuters survey showed it sold 61% more merchandise in the ten days after it released the ads, compared with the ten days prior. In the United States, large companies with big investment budgets can actually hope to influence policy outcomes.   The maths is more difficult where China is concerned. Brands don’t want to alienate the huge market, or anger a government that isn’t afraid to meddle in business. Even Nike has opted to avoid any controversy. Earlier this year it abruptly abandoned plans to sell a limited-edition design in China – where it earned 14% of revenue last year - after its collaborator showed support for the Hong Kong protesters on social media.   This might also explain why Hong Kong’s biggest conglomerates such as CK Hutchison and Swire Pacific have had little to say on the subject of the city’s political turbulence. That could change if their earnings and share prices start to suffer. Even then, Hong Kong may end up proving the limits of companies’ taste for political engagement.

The demonstrations pop up almost daily, often with little notice, as activists spread word of their cause with handwritten notes on so-called Lennon Walls across the territory and through Telegram and other messaging apps.  What started as an angry response to a now-suspended extradition bill now includes demands for greater democracy, the resignation of Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, and even keeping mainland tourists out of Hong Kong.  “I’m afraid there will be more confrontation further down the road,” said Labour Party lawmaker Fernando Cheung, who has tried to mediate between activists and police.  “The protests will continue,” he added. “I would expect sizeable protests on and off continuously throughout the summer.”   On Wednesday, organizers of a “silver-haired” march said 9,000 mostly elderly people, some in wheelchairs, took to the streets in support of younger protesters. Police put the number at 1,500 at its peak.  “The whole turmoil is caused by the missteps of government,” said Margaret Yu, 59, a retired accountant. “As an elderly person, at least, I have to stand out and voice out how unjust our government is.”   Wednesday’s rally was the latest in a series that have rocked the Asian financial center for more than two months, plunging the city into turmoil and posing the greatest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.    Lam has said the extradition bill, which would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial, is “dead.” But opponents say nothing short of officially withdrawing it will do.   They fear the bill would leave Hong Kong people at the mercy of Chinese courts, where human rights are not guaranteed, and have voiced concerns over the city’s much-cherished rule of law.   In addition to Lam’s ouster, protesters are demanding the word “riot” be withdrawn from the government’s description of demonstrations, the unconditional release of those arrested and an independent investigation into complaints of excessive force by police.   The next big protest is scheduled for Sunday, with demonstrators marching from Victoria Park near the bustling shopping district of Causeway Bay to the Court of Final Appeal in Central.  Other protests are planned over coming weekends in areas including Mong Kok, a gritty working-class district across the harbor from the financial center, as well as in Tseung Kwan O and Sham Shui Po, one of Hong Kong’s poorest areas.  “Protesting in locales such as Mong Kok ... only adds to the threat of violence, given the population density and the presence of triad societies,” said Steve Vickers, a risk consultant and a former commander of the Royal Hong Kong Police Criminal Intelligence Bureau.  Triad gangs, he said, “may act as agitators for either side, or simply take actions to protect their own interests.”  Under the terms of the handover from Britain in 1997, Hong Kong was allowed to retain extensive freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland under a “one country, two systems” formula, including an independent judiciary and right to protest.  But for many Hong Kong residents, the extradition bill is the latest step in a relentless march toward mainland control.  Deep-seated anger with the government has seen scores of smaller groups protest in the streets and sparked grassroots initiatives such as crowdfunding drives and newspaper ad campaigns.  Millions have taken to the streets since June in Hong Kong’s largest and most violent protests in decades, with police firing rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse activists, and protesters storming and ransacking the Legislative Council.    The protesters have adopted a “be water” strategy, inspired by a maxim of the city’s home-grown martial arts legend, Bruce Lee, that encourages them to be flexible or formless.   Some activists say it’s a very different approach from that of the democracy demonstrations in 2014, when protesters occupied major roads in the city for 79 days.   “We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in the streets, we shall fight in all districts of Hong Kong, we shall bring the fight from local arenas to international fronts, whatever the costs may be. We shall never surrender,” the Students’ Unions of Higher Institutions in Hong Kong said in a statement.  The movement’s fluidity makes it difficult to police, taking a toll on officers who have fought pitched battles with protesters and leading to a crisis of confidence on the force.  The protests have at times paralyzed parts of the financial district, shut government offices and disrupted business operations across the city.   Hong Kong retailers warned that July and August sales could drop by double digits from a year earlier because of the unrest, while tourism numbers and hotel occupancy rates are slumping.  Activists have seized on support for the protests to bolster the democratic opposition’s prospects in the November elections, with the hope it can recapture its veto bloc from pro-establishment rivals.  “There are obviously political forces which would like to maintain enthusiasm among protesters. This is the driving force for some people to mobilize and motivate protesters,” said veteran pollster Robert Chung.  Lawmaker Regina Ip, in a letter to the South China Morning Post on Monday, said the protests were likely to continue in all 18 districts until the polls in late November.  Others are digging in for a longer stretch.   “What we’re experiencing is an infinity war,” said Joshua Wong, who was one of the leaders of the 2014 pro-democracy protests. “I am still optimistic.” 	Reuters

Police provided relatively low estimates and the protest organizers gave much higher numbers, both trying to prove a point.  For Reuters, this was an opportunity to provide an independent estimate that would be an indicator of political sentiment in one of the world’s premier financial hubs.  To do this, a team led by Deputy Head of Graphics Simon Scarr used Google Earth and TripAdvisor, fishing chairs and sunscreen, and pored over 18 hours of video to come up with an estimate of the size of the crowd in the streets.  Scarr first went through the three-km (two-mile) route of a march scheduled for July 1 step by step, spending hours on Google Earth to pin down locations where the bulk of the protesters would need to funnel through. These would be the places to monitor and measure the flow of the crowd.   “I spent time scouring the area for bridges and vantage points, looking down from them from all angles,” Scarr said. ”Eventually I was able to find a few elevated positions that would cover anyone marching to the government headquarters or end portion of the march.”  One of these vantage points was from a hotel. Scarr looked through traveler photographs taken from the hotel on TripAdvisor. Sure enough, one holiday maker shared a view of the city which incorporated the exact spot on the road the team needed.  Data Visualisation developer Marco Hernandez, based in Hong Kong, visited the sites and took test images and video.  Once the key spots were finalised, Scarr, along with Manas Sharma, another member of the graphics team based in Singapore, flew to Hong Kong. Together with Hernandez and journalists from the Hong Kong bureau, they split into three teams.   The main monitoring station was at the chosen hotel, with a camera recording HD video pointed at the march route below. A second camera caught additional material and also served as a backup.  The other two counting stations, on footbridges, relied on smaller cameras. Anticipating the long hot day ahead, the team packed water, sunscreen and hats along with protective gear and press credentials. They also took along folding fishing chairs for the long day ahead.  It took over four hours to capture the march on video from start to finish.  Then it was time to count the numbers, manually. The team used 30 second bursts of video at regular intervals and counted the number of people crossing a particular point. The numbers were then extrapolated for the length of the march.  The result - an estimated 227,000 people took part in the march, versus police estimates of 190,000 and the organizers claim of over half a million participants.  Reuters' calculations are an estimate of the total number taking part in the march. They do not include protesters who did not march. The result was detailed here: ""How many protesters took to the streets on July 1?""   “The people here are very passionate about their city and it seems easy to get caught up in that, but reporting the facts we could actually see was our aim,” Hernandez said.

The activism has also powered a wave of colorful cultural expressions of diverse origins, from protest mooncakes to Christian hymns, that have filled the city’s streets.  Here are some of them:  HALLELUJAH  The five-word Christian hymn “Sing Hallelujah to the Lord”, originally penned in the United States in 1974, emerged as an unlikely anthem of the protests and was heard almost non-stop at the main demonstration site in front of the city’s Legislative Council.  As religious gatherings can be held without a permit in Hong Kong, the song provided a cover of legitimacy for protesters and was first used by a group of Christian students.  Its simple melody and words helped spread its use and it was seen at times as defusing tension with the police.   HAND SIGNALS  To coordinate amid the crowd chaos, protesters rapidly formed human chains that passed supplies as needed. A system of hand signals helped protesters communicate where supplies or aid were needed and to assist with constructing barriers.   (Click tmsnrt.rs/32pNi2Q to see a detailed interactive graphic about human chains and hand signals used during the Hong Kong protests over the extradition law.)  UMBRELLAS  Umbrellas, particularly yellow ones, have become a symbol of Hong Kong’s democracy movement. Coming to prominence during the “Occupy” movement in 2014, protesters used umbrellas to protect themselves from pepper spray and tear gas fired by the police. An open umbrella also helps to keep the protester out of reach of police batons on the frontlines of violent clashes.   UNION JACKS, BLACK FLAGS  The Union Jack and Hong Kong’s colonial-era flag appeared prominently during protests, designed to rile authorities in Beijing. The Union Jack was unfurled when protesters stormed the legislature on July 1, the 22nd anniversary of the return of Hong Kong to China rule.  “I miss colonial times. The British colonial time was so good for us. I saw the future,” Alexandra Wong, 63, a protester known affectionately as ‘Grandma Wong’, who is usually seen waving a large British flag during the demonstrations, told Reuters.  An altered version of Hong Kong’s post-handover flag, with a black background instead of red, has been brandished by protesters, with the tips of the territory’s emblem flower, the bauhinia, on it dipped in red.   ‘BE WATER’, AS BRUCE LEE SAID  “You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend,” Hong Kong’s martial arts legend Bruce Lee said during a 1971 interview in regards to his character on the TV series “Longstreet”.   References to that quote have appeared on signs and chants during the protests, as a call for activists to mobilize and disperse quickly.  That fluid and nimble approach marks a shift in strategy from the 2014 Occupy protests, when activists spent months encamped in the same places.   POST-IT ‘LENNON WALLS’  Mosaics of sticky notes containing messages of support for protesters have popped up across the territory from the Central financial district to Lantau island.  Part art, part politics, supporters have dubbed them “Lennon Walls” after the original John Lennon Wall in communist-controlled Prague in the 1980s, which was covered with graffiti, Beatles lyrics and messages of political protest.

678	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N24H2AR	July 18, 2019 /  8:57 AM / 9 months ago	How Reuters counted a quarter million people at Hong Kong's protests	"HONG KONG (Reuters) - When large-scale demonstrations plunged Hong Kong into political crisis, the size of the crowds quickly became a contentious issue.  Police provided relatively low estimates and the protest organizers gave much higher numbers, both trying to prove a point.  For Reuters, this was an opportunity to provide an independent estimate that would be an indicator of political sentiment in one of the world’s premier financial hubs.  To do this, a team led by Deputy Head of Graphics Simon Scarr used Google Earth and TripAdvisor, fishing chairs and sunscreen, and pored over 18 hours of video to come up with an estimate of the size of the crowd in the streets.  Scarr first went through the three-km (two-mile) route of a march scheduled for July 1 step by step, spending hours on Google Earth to pin down locations where the bulk of the protesters would need to funnel through. These would be the places to monitor and measure the flow of the crowd.   “I spent time scouring the area for bridges and vantage points, looking down from them from all angles,” Scarr said. ”Eventually I was able to find a few elevated positions that would cover anyone marching to the government headquarters or end portion of the march.”  One of these vantage points was from a hotel. Scarr looked through traveler photographs taken from the hotel on TripAdvisor. Sure enough, one holiday maker shared a view of the city which incorporated the exact spot on the road the team needed.  Data Visualisation developer Marco Hernandez, based in Hong Kong, visited the sites and took test images and video.  Once the key spots were finalised, Scarr, along with Manas Sharma, another member of the graphics team based in Singapore, flew to Hong Kong. Together with Hernandez and journalists from the Hong Kong bureau, they split into three teams.   The main monitoring station was at the chosen hotel, with a camera recording HD video pointed at the march route below. A second camera caught additional material and also served as a backup.  The other two counting stations, on footbridges, relied on smaller cameras. Anticipating the long hot day ahead, the team packed water, sunscreen and hats along with protective gear and press credentials. They also took along folding fishing chairs for the long day ahead.  It took over four hours to capture the march on video from start to finish.  Then it was time to count the numbers, manually. The team used 30 second bursts of video at regular intervals and counted the number of people crossing a particular point. The numbers were then extrapolated for the length of the march.  The result - an estimated 227,000 people took part in the march, versus police estimates of 190,000 and the organizers claim of over half a million participants.  Reuters' calculations are an estimate of the total number taking part in the march. They do not include protesters who did not march. The result was detailed here: ""How many protesters took to the streets on July 1?""   “The people here are very passionate about their city and it seems easy to get caught up in that, but reporting the facts we could actually see was our aim,” Hernandez said.

The group relies on jewelry for the bulk of sales, with brands that also include Van Cleef & Arpels, and strong momentum in this sector has persuaded rivals, including Kering’s (PRTP.PA) Gucci, to branch into high-end gems.      But Geneva-based Richemont is also a major player in the tougher watch industry, which is under pressure more broadly as consumers tastes shift, and has now been hit by political protests in recent weeks in Hong Kong.   In June, the United States overtook the Chinese-ruled city as the world’s biggest export market for Swiss watches, export data from Switzerland showed on Thursday, as sales into Hong Kong slumped.   “Sales in Hong Kong retreated, additionally impacted by the relative strength of the Hong Kong dollar and the recent street protests,” Richemont said of its overall business there.   Its shares were down 2.35% at 0730GMT, while those in rival Swatch (UHR.S), which shone on the stock market on Wednesday after it gave a rosy outlook for the second half of the year, were down 0.7%.  After buying back large amounts of excess watch stocks in recent years, Richemont, known for high-end IWC and Jaeger-LeCoultre luxury timepieces, has also been reducing wholesale distribution and keeping a tight leash on new inventory.   That shake-up of its retail network had contributed to the 2% fall in watch sales at constant currencies in the three months to end-June.   Richemont, which gave no full-year outlook, highlighted that more product launches were due later in its second quarter.   “Specialist watchmakers were once again rather weak, still impacted by distribution optimization,” analysts at Vontobel said in a note.   Sales at Richemont’s jewelry brands were stronger, however, rising 7% at constant currencies, and the group said that mainland China had more broadly proved a bright spot, mirroring trends across the broader luxury goods industry.   Some more fashion-orientated groups like Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (LVMH.PA) have benefited as Chinese shoppers spend more at home, encouraged by Beijing’s bid to boost domestic consumption with import tariff cuts that have fed through to prices.   In Europe, Richemont’s revenue fell 1% in the April to June period. Richemont’s overall sales rose 12% to 3.74 billion euros ($4.20 billion), up 9% at constant currencies.  This included its online distributors like Yoox Net-A-Porter, which it acquired full control of last year in a bid to accelerate its e-commerce push, an area where high-end watchmakers and jewelry firms are playing catch-up.      Without these platforms, sales would have been up 3% at constant exchange rates. 	Reuters

682	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1U904G	July 14, 2019 /  6:16 AM / 9 months ago	Clashes break out as Hong Kong protesters escalate fight in suburbs	HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tens of thousands rallied in a large Hong Kong suburb on Sunday, driven by abiding anger at the government’s handling of an extradition bill that has revived fears of China tightening its grip over the former British colony and eroding its freedoms.    Clashes broke out as protesters hurled umbrellas and plastic bottles at police who retaliated by firing pepper spray amid chaotic scenes inside a shopping mall that houses some of the world’s biggest luxury brands.   Most of the demonstrators dispersed shortly afterward as a small group sang the Christian hymn “Sing Hallelujah to the Lord”, which has emerged as the unlikely anthem of the protests.    Millions have taken to the streets in the past month in some of the largest and most violent protests in decades over an extradition bill that would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.   Protesters marched in sweltering heat of about 32 degrees Celsius (89.6°F) in Sha Tin, a town between Hong Kong island and the border with China, extending the demonstrations outward from the heart of the financial center into surrounding districts.    “These days there is really no trust of China, and so the protesters come out,” said Jennie Kwan, 73.   “Didn’t they promise 50 years, no change? And yet we’ve all seen the changes. I myself am already 70-something years old. What do I know about politics? But politics comes to you.”    Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that guarantees its people freedoms for 50 years that are not enjoyed in mainland China, including the liberty to protest and an independent judiciary.  Beijing denies interfering in Hong Kong affairs, but many residents worry about what they see as an erosion of those freedoms and a relentless march toward mainland control.  Hong Kong’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, has said the extradition bill is “dead”, but opponents say they will settle for nothing short of its formal withdrawal.   Some protesters on Sunday waved banners appealing to U.S. President Donald Trump to “Please liberate Hong Kong” and “Defend our Constitution”. Such scenes are certain to rile Beijing, which has been angered by criticism from Washington and London over the controversial bill.  Others waved British and American flags, while banners calling for Hong Kong’s independence billowed in the sultry breeze from makeshift flagpoles.   One placard featured a picture of Chinese leader Xi Jinping with the words: “Extradite to China, disappear forever.”  Chants of “Carrie Lam go to hell!” rang through the crowd, gathered well away from the island heart of the financial center which has witnessed the largest and most violent demonstrations over the past month.   Organizers said around 115,000 attended Sunday’s rally. Police put the number at 28,000 at its peak.   Police chief Stephen Lo said 10 officers were injured and taken to hospital during clashes, including one who had a segment of his finger bitten off by a protester.  More than 40 people were arrested for charges including assaulting police and illegal assembly, he added.    The bill has stirred outrage across broad sections of Hong Kong society amid concerns it would threaten the much-cherished rule of law that underpins the city’s international financial status. Young, elderly and families joined the latest protest.  The protests have caused the former British colony’s biggest political crisis since its handover to China. Demonstrators stormed the Legislative Council building on July 1 and ransacked it.   “I never missed a march so far since June,” said a 69-year-old man who gave only his surname, Chen.  “I support the youngsters, they have done something we haven’t done. There is nothing we can do to help them, but come out and march to show our appreciation and support.”    Protesters are also demanding that Lam step down, the withdrawal of the word “riot” to describe demonstrations, the unconditional release of those arrested and an independent investigation into complaints of police brutality.  Police have condemned what they describe as “violent protesters” and stressed that officers will investigate all illegal acts.  One woman, in her mid-50s, said protesters had harassed her after she tried to defend the police, whom activists described as “dogs”.  “It’s verbal violence,” said the woman, who gave her name only as Catherine. “People just surrounded me and shouted rude language and that makes me feel I am living in fear.”  Mass protests over the bill since June have morphed into demonstrations over democracy and broader grievances in society.  On Saturday, a largely peaceful demonstration in a town close to the Chinese border turned violent as protesters hurled umbrellas and hardhats at police, who retaliated by swinging batons and firing pepper spray.  The government condemned violence during Saturday’s protests against so-called “parallel traders” from the mainland who buy goods in bulk in Hong Kong to carry into China for profit.  It said that during the last 18 months it had arrested 126 mainland visitors suspected of infringing the terms of their stay by engaging in parallel trading, and barred about 5,000 mainland Chinese also suspected of involvement.  Earlier on Sunday, hundreds of journalists joined a silent march to demand better treatment from police at protests.  A police statement said that while there was room for improvement in coordination between officers and the media, the police respected press freedom and the media’s right to report.  	Reuters

684	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1U805E	July 13, 2019 /  7:30 AM / 9 months ago	Hong Kong protesters, police clash as demonstrations target Chinese traders	HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong protesters clashed with police on Saturday in a town near the boundary with mainland China where thousands rallied against the presence of Chinese traders, seizing on another grievance following major unrest over an extradition bill.  Protesters in Sheung Shui, not far from the Chinese city of Shenzhen, threw umbrellas and hardhats at police, who retaliated by swinging batons and firing pepper spray.  “Our lovely town has become chaos,” resident Ryan Lai, 50, said shortly before the protest turned violent.  “We don’t want to stop travel and buying, but please, just make it orderly and legal,” he added, referring to so-called “parallel traders” who buy large volumes of duty-free goods in the town, to be carried into mainland China and sold.  “The extradition bill was the tipping point for us to come out. We want Sheung Shui back.”  The traders have long been a source of anger among those in Hong Kong who blame them for fuelling inflation, driving up property prices and dodging taxes.  Later, police urged protesters to refrain from violence and leave. By about 8:30 p.m. (1230 GMT), most had retreated as police in riot helmets and wielding large shields swept through the town to clear the streets.  Early on Sunday, the Hong Kong government condemned violent acts during the protests, adding that it had already taken steps to tackle parallel trading.  Anti-extradition protesters plan another demonstration on Sunday in the town of Sha Tin, in the so-called New Territories between Hong Kong island and the border with China.  Saturday’s protest, which had begun peacefully, was the latest in more than a month to roil the former British colony, grappling with its worst political crisis since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  Sometimes violent, the protests have drawn in millions of people, with hundreds even storming the legislature on July 1 to oppose a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to China to face trial in courts under ruling Communist Party control.  Critics see the bill as a threat to Hong Kong’s rule of law. Chief Executive Carrie Lam this week said the bill was “dead” after having suspended it last month, but opponents vow to settle for nothing short of its formal withdrawal.  Protests against the bill had largely centered on Hong Kong’s main business district, but demonstrators have recently begun to look elsewhere to widen support by taking up narrower, more domestic issues.  The Sheung Shui protests opposed small-time Chinese traders who make short trips into the territory to buy goods they then haul back to China to sell. Protesters chanted demands in Mandarin, China’s official language, for the traders to leave.  In a statement on Sunday, Hong Kong’s government said that over the last 18 months it had arrested 126 mainland visitors suspected of contravening the terms of their stay by engaging in parallel trading, and barred about 5,000 mainland Chinese also suspected of involvement.  At Britain’s handover 22 years ago, Chinese Communist leaders promised the city a high degree of autonomy for 50 years. But many say China has progressively tightened its grip, putting Hong Kong’s freedoms under threat with measures such as the extradition bill.  Hong Kong’s lack of full democracy was behind the recent unrest, said Jimmy Sham of the Civil Human Rights Front, which organized protests against the extradition bill.  “The government, Carrie Lam, some legislators in functional constituencies are not elected by the people, so there are many escalating actions in different districts to reflect different social issues,” he said. “If political problems are not solved, social well-being issues will continue to emerge endlessly.”  One protester said Saturday’s scuffles started when demonstrators charged police who sought to help mainland traders who had assaulted protesters.  “Some people were attacked and got injured in a stampede,” said the man, who would only give the name Ragnar. “I tried to save some girls so I was also attacked by pepper spray by police. Now I feel so bad. The cops are dogs.”   Protesters ripped up median barriers and fences to set up roadblocks and defenses.  A young man was treated for a bloody head wound a few meters from where police surrounded by crowds were hitting activists armed with umbrellas. Police in riot gear wielded batons to clear the street minutes later and free trapped officers.  “We have no weapons and we were peaceful. When we saw them taking photos of us in the crowd we had to react,” said another protester, surnamed Chan, who declined to give his full name.  “We are all scared now. How can they hit us with batons?” he said, staring at a pool of blood where one of his peers was treated.  The police public affairs office did not have an immediate comment when asked about police actions against the protesters.  Last week nearly 2,000 people marched in the Tuen Mun residential district to protest against what they saw as the nuisance of brash singing and dancing to Mandarin pop songs by middle-aged mainland women.  On Sunday, tens of thousands marched in one of Kowloon’s  most popular tourist shopping areas, trying to persuade mainland Chinese tourists to back opposition to the extradition bill.  “We want to raise awareness in Washington that the United States has to do more now to help Hong Kong become fully democratic,” said a resident of the nearby town of Fanling, who was one of five people in Saturday’s crowd carrying U.S. flags.  “They are the most important power left that can stand up to China,” added the 30-year-old man, who gave his name only as David.

685	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1U60Y4	July 11, 2019 /  8:23 AM / 9 months ago	Activists lay flowers at memorial for Hong Kong protester	HONG KONG (Reuters) - Thousands of people in Hong Kong laid sunflowers and white lilies at a memorial site on Thursday for a man who fell to his death during protests against an extradition bill that has plunged the former British colony into turmoil.  Marco Leung, 35, fell from construction scaffolding in June after unfurling banners against now suspended legislation that would have let people be sent to mainland China for trial.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has made rare public apologies over upheaval from the bill, which triggered Hong Kong’s biggest crisis in decades, saying this week it was “dead” and work on it had been a “total failure.”  Those comments have not appeased protesters, who say nothing less than the bill’s full withdrawal will do.   More protests are planned for the weekend.   People of all ages attended the outdoor service for Leung at a public playground, where volunteers offered tissues to mourners and Red Cross workers stood by to provide advice.  Hundreds lined up in intermittent rain to pay respects, with the crowd swelling in the evening as people came from work.   “Life is indeed precious ... But for freedom, life can be sacrificed,” Methodist minister Yuen Tin-Yau, one of the event’s organizers, said in a speech. “The reason why human beings on earth are human is to sacrifice themselves for the sake of benevolence, justice, friendship and freedom.”  Rowina Ngan, a 45-year-old textbook editor, said she was saddened and unsettled by the political standoff.  “The youngsters are very sad. I can’t find any solution for our kids. Society can’t accept ‘the bill is dead’, actually it’s more ‘our hearts are dead’.”  Stress and trauma over the turmoil have created an unprecedented mental health problem that the city is not equipped to deal with, medical professionals say.  Psychologists and social workers also attended the memorial to provide support.  Hong Kong’s youth have been at the forefront of the city’s biggest and most violent protests in decades, with police firing rubber bullets and tear gas in chaotic scenes.  Organizers read out a statement from Leung’s parents that thanked the community and expressed hope Hong Kong would see better days.  “Every brave Hong Konger going to the streets is doing so because they love Hong Kong so much,” the message said.   “Young people, please protect yourselves, and keep your body and soul together, then you have a chance to speak out about injustices in society.” 	Reuters

Today, similar sticky note mosaics have popped up on walls across the territory amid rolling protests against the government’s handling of a controversial extradition bill, highlighting how widespread the demonstrations have become.  Part art, part politics, supporters have dubbed them “Lennon Walls” after the original John Lennon Wall in communist-controlled Prague in the 1980s that was covered with graffiti, Beatles lyrics and messages of political grievance.  For over a month, the former British colony of Hong Kong has been rocked by large and sometimes violent protests against a bill that would allow for the extradition of criminal suspects to China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.  The city’s Beijing-backed leader has suspended the bill, declaring it “dead”, but opponents want it formally withdrawn, fearing the further erosion of freedoms promised to Hong Kong when it returned to China in 1997.  The movement in recent days has turned to sticky labels.  Lennon Walls have popped up from the financial district to Lantau island, where the airport is situated.  In Tai Po, a district about halfway between the downtown area and the border with China, an underpass was converted into a “Lennon tunnel”, with pastel yellow, blue, pink and white messages across the walls.  “Go Hong Kong!” some said. “Free Hong Kong,” said others.  “No rioting, only tyranny” was another message, a reference to the government’s labeling of actions during a demonstration on June 12 as rioting. Police responded that day by firing tear gas, rubber bullets and bean bag rounds.  Kelly, a 19-year-old political science student, said the wall at Hong Kong University served as a reminder.  “We want everyone in HKU or nearby to understand what happened in Hong Kong in the past month, and we just hope to remind people that this government ... can’t kill our spirit, our values, what we treasure the most,” she said.  Some of the messages went beyond small square notes.  At more than one Lennon Wall, protesters taped pictures of Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and pro-Beijing lawmakers to the floor to create “democracy dance pads” - and invited people to stomp on the images to music.  One innovative protester hung a flip-flop on a string, taped it to the wall, encouraging people to fling it at a picture of Lam, according to an image on Facebook.  One pink Post-it note bore a simple personal message: “Marry me, Jess.”  The outpouring of wall-borne emotion has spread as protesters organize demonstrations across the territory, including areas that rarely see political activism.  The sticky notes have not been universally welcomed.  On Wednesday night, police intervened when note posters scuffled with men trying to remove them in Yau Tong, a working class neighborhood on the eastern side of Kowloon, across the harbor from Hong Kong island.  By Thursday morning, all the hundreds of memos there had been removed. A few notes were left on the ground, including one saying “Hong Kongers, never give up”.  Elsewhere, police said on Thursday they had arrested a man who assaulted another at a Lennon Wall in the Kowloon Bay part of town. The origin of the attack was not immediately clear.  In the face of opposition, protesters have refused to let it be.  Some supporters have mounted 24-hour guard rotations over the walls. In some places, Post-its and messages have been covered over with plastic or tape to preserve them.  In Telegram messaging groups, protesters called for people to come create a Lennon Wall at Yau Tong police quarters on Friday.  Hong Kong activists on Thursday lay sunflowers and white lilies at a memorial site for a man who fell to his death during protests against the extradition bill. 	Reuters

With sterling still acting as the clearest expression of financial markets’ take on Brexit risks, another currency storm is brewing a little over three months before the third Brexit deadline of 2019.   The favourite to be next prime minister, Boris Johnson, sees that Oct. 31 date as set in stone, regardless of whether or not a deal is achieved with the European Union.  Economic soundings too have turned ugly again as factories, builders and retailers freeze and Bank of England chief Mark Carney - tipped by some as the next International Monetary Fund head - appears to have backed down on his relatively hawkish stance on further interest rate rises to protect the pound.   To top it all, Britain’s diplomatic relations with the world’s two biggest economies have deteriorated sharply just as it prepares to cut ties with the EU, its biggest trading partner.   A row with China over recent Hong Kong protests was compounded this week by an unprecedented war of words with Washington over leaked emails showing the U.K. ambassador highly critical of President Donald Trump’s administration.  The combination knocked sterling to its weakest in more than two years against the dollar, if a January “flash crash” incident is discounted. It is also at the weakest this year against a trade-weighted basket of world currencies.  (GRAPHIC: Trade-weighted sterling - tmsnrt.rs/2G5B8Tr)  Against the euro, performance is even more dismal - it is set for a record tenth consecutive weekly fall against the single currency, briefly breaching the psychologically key 90 pence level for the first time since January.  (GRAPHIC: Pound set for record losing streak vs euro - tmsnrt.rs/2YU4Xxq)  All the uncertainty over when and how Britain will exit the EU is now taking a heavy toll on the economy which had stayed relatively robust until the first 2019 quarter.       “Previously the narrative around sterling was that steady UK fundamentals would offset the messy politics, but that has now changed after recent data,” said Neil Mellor, senior FX strategist at BNY Mellon.  Data last week suggested the British economy may be on track for a possible contraction in the June quarter, manufacturers had their worst month in more than six years, while retail sales suffered a record annual fall for June  The result is that a Citigroup index of economic activity in Britain has dropped to its lowest levels in eight years while similar gauges in Europe have stabilised.   (GRAPHIC: Citi Econ Index  Europe vs UK - tmsnrt.rs/2G3HjHK)     The weak data has also chipped away at one of the last supports for the pound: the possibility of a Bank of England interest rate hike. The last of those hopes evaporated on July 2 as BOE governor Carney signalled he could be about to join other central bank peers in cutting rates.  Since that day, sterling has lost 1.6% and money markets now fully expect a quarter-point rate cut by February 2020.    But Kamal Sharma, a London-based director of G10 FX strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says a cut may come as soon as this November, given sterling will also face headwinds from the worsening global economic picture.  “Historically, the pound has been closely correlated to global growth and particularly to the euro zone growth outlook. Both of them have struggled,” Sharma said.  A large balance of payments deficit makes it particularly vulnerable compared to most other developed countries. The deficit was 5.6% of annual economic output in the first quarter, or around 30 billion pounds.  The next big level for the pound versus the greenback is the January 2017 low of $1.20 after which the Brexit referendum low of $1.1491, hit in October 2016, beckons.  Its fresh declines mirror a renewed short-selling spree that has seen net short bets against the pound climb for more than two months, even if still some 40% below the record highs of April 2017.   (GRAPHIC:  FX market positions - tmsnrt.rs/2FPLRRN)  One reason traders give for why speculation in the futures market is not yet as extreme as two years ago is that investors are increasingly using options to bet against the pound or hedge against another steep drop.  On the face of it, implied sterling volatility derived from the options market appears to be low, but that merely reflects an ultra-low volatility environment for world currency markets at large and traders note sterling volatility is sharply higher than on other major developed currencies.   One-year implied pound volatility displays a premium of around 1.6 vol to the average vol of other G10 currencies, according to Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets. Historically, sterling vol has traded at an average  1.5-2.0 vol discount, the following chart from RBC shows.  (GRAPHIC: Pound volatility vs G10 FX volatility - tmsnrt.rs/2YOLbUc)  Moreover, six-month and three-month implied vols have risen in recent days, which Cole said was down to markets “taking the October Brexit deadline much more seriously than the (original) March deadline.”  (GRAPHIC:  October jitters - tmsnrt.rs/2YG2ruN)  Finally, whoever wins the leadership contest will face testy negotiations with the EU, which has already refused to reopen the Brexit deal agreed by outgoing prime minister Theresa May.  “Theresa May has done this unsuccessfully for several months now, and I am not sure whether the next prime minister can change that whether he is called Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt,” said Esther Reichelt, FX Strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.

Last week, recruitment industry group REC’s report said the number of people hired for permanent jobs through recruitment firms in Britain fell for a fourth straight month in June.  The company, which helps hire executives, professionals and clerical staff, said operating profit was likely to be at the lower end of the £156.5 million to £168 million range.  Gross profit in the UK, which accounts for 16% of the group, declined 2.4% to £35 million in the second quarter.  Greater China reported a 1% fall in quarterly gross profit because of the continuing impact of trade tariff uncertainty and more recently, social unrest in Hong Kong.  “Fee earner headcount fell in markets where we saw more challenging conditions, such as France, Greater China and the UK,” said Chief Financial Officer Kelvin Stagg.  Rival recruiter Robert Walters (RWA.L) is also feeling pressure in the UK as it reported an 8% fall in net fee income in Britain in the quarter.  PageGroup’s shares are expected to fall as much as 5% according to premarket indicators. 	Reuters

Protests against the now-suspended bill have drawn millions of people to the streets in the former British colony in recent weeks, posing the biggest challenge Beijing has faced to its rule in the territory since Hong Kong returned to Chinese control in 1997.  The protests have received little coverage in mainland China, however, with censors blocking news of the largest demonstrations on Chinese soil since the bloody suppression of pro-democracy protests centered on Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1989.  The bill, which would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party, has triggered outrage across broad sections of Hong Kong society amid concerns it threatens the much-cherished rule of law that underpins the city’s international financial status.  Hong Kong has been governed under a “one country, two systems” formula since its return to Chinese rule, allowing freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including the right to protest and an independent judiciary.  China and Britain have engaged in a public spat over the bill but Chinese ambassador Liu Xiaoming told BBC TV on Sunday that China was “not interested in diplomatic war with the UK” and he had full confidence in Hong Kong’s ability to resolve the situation without China’s intervention.  Protesters on Sunday braved intermittent rain and marched through streets of Tsim Sha Tsui, a popular shopping destination dotted with luxury shops, to try to deliver their message directly to mainland Chinese tourists in the hope of garnering sympathy.  At times they shouted slogans in Mandarin, mainland China’s official tongue, as opposed to Hong Kong’s main language Cantonese.  They also handed out flyers and sent messages by social media and Apple’s phone-to-phone AirDrop system written in the simplified form of Chinese characters used on the mainland.  The short march finished at the city’s high-speed rail station that connects Hong Kong to the mainland, one of the main entry points for Chinese visitors but a sensitive spot after part of the facility came under Chinese jurisdiction last year.  “It is hoped that Hong Kong people can spread how Hong Kong people can march peacefully and bring the protest information back to the mainland to mainland visitors,” Lau Wing-hong, one of the protest organizers, told Reuters.  The march was the first major demonstration since Monday when protesters besieged and ransacked the legislative building in the heart of the city on the 22nd anniversary of the handover before being driven back by police firing tear gas.   The authorities took no chances. Police and train staff guarded every exit of the station. Hong Kong’s MTR Corp Ltd, which runs the city’s metro, planned to shut all entrances to the West Kowloon station apart from a route for passengers. Food and beverage outlets were also closed.      Online train tickets between Hong Kong and Shenzhen on the mainland were displayed as sold out from 2:30 p.m.-6:30 p.m. (0630 GMT-1030 GMT), coinciding with the hours of the protest.  Shanghai businessman Alan Zhang watched the procession near an Apple store on Canton Road.  “Actually, I feel quite touched to see how Hong Kong people fight for their freedom,” said Zhang, 54, a frequent visitor to Hong Kong.  “That’s something we can’t do in China. I think first-time travelers do not know what is happening right now... Indeed it let me see why Hong Kong is different from China. I received flyers and AirDrop - very smart act.”  Hundreds of police lined the route, temporarily closing some roads and diverting public transport.  The organizer said 230,000 people had attended the march, while police put the number at 56,000 at its peak.  By 7:30pm (1130 GMT) most had left, but as the evening wore on several hundred regrouped and marched up a busy street toward the densely populated Mong Kok neighborhood, blocking traffic along the way.  Lines of police with helmets and plastic shields stopped their advance, and worked to disperse the group by driving them back, mostly peacefully. Live TV footage appeared to show a handful of protesters being detained after being wrestled to the ground.  Hong Kong’s Tourism Association said some travel agencies stayed away from Tsim Sha Tsui on Sunday.  The extradition bill, which has left Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam clinging to her job, would cover Hong Kong residents and foreign and Chinese nationals living or traveling through the city. Protesters want the bill withdrawn altogether.  Lawyers and rights groups say China’s justice system is marked by torture, forced confessions and arbitrary detention, claims that Beijing denies.   Lam has offered closed-door talks to students from two universities but activists said they want the discussions to be open to the public and called for a halt to investigations of protesters. Police began arresting protesters this week. 	Reuters

China and Britain have engaged in a public spat over mass protests in Hong Kong against a now suspended bill that would allow extradition to mainland China.   Asked whether Beijing would intervene directly, ambassador Liu Xiaoming Liu told BBC TV that China was fully committed to the “one country, two systems” agreement and that he had full confidence in Hong Kong’s ability to resolve the situation.  He said it was the British government that was interfering in Hong Kong’s internal affairs and trying to “obstruct the legal process”.  Liu was summoned to the British foreign office earlier this week following his comments that “colonial” Britain should keep its “hands off Hong Kong”. Hong Kong was under British rule for almost 150 years until 1997.  “We are not interested in diplomatic war with the UK, ... we are still committed to this golden era between our two countries,” he said on Sunday, but added that the language used by some British politicians was “Cold War mentality language”.  In her first few months in office in 2016 Prime Minister Theresa May hailed “a golden era” of Sino-British relations, a phrase both countries have continued to use since.   But Britain’s relations with China under May, who is due to step down later this month, have also been complicated by a disagreement with Washington over whether to ban China’s Huawei from 5G telecommunications networks as a security risk.  Liu said he could promise “100 percent” that Huawei would not pass information back to the government in Beijing.  “Huawei is a good company, it is a leader of 5G. I think it you reject Huawei you will miss enormous opportunities. I think they are here for win-win cooperation they are not here to spy on people,” he said.  Hundreds of protesters in the former British colony besieged and broke into the legislature on Monday after a demonstration marking the anniversary of return to Chinese rule.  Critics say the extradition bill would undermine Hong Kong’s much-cherished independent judiciary and give Beijing powers to prosecute activists in mainland courts, which are controlled by the Communist Party.  Liu told the BBC that Hong Kong had received no instructions or orders from Beijing to introduce the bill. He rejected that it would make it easy to extradite people to China from Hong Kong as the legislation included safeguards such as prohibiting extradition for religious or political beliefs.

Protesters now plan to take their message directly to mainland Chinese tourists for the first time with a rally finishing at the city’s high-speed rail station that connects to the mainland.  Hong Kong’s MTR Corporation, which runs the city’s underground railway, said it would shut all entrances to the West Kowloon station apart from a specific route for passengers. Food and beverage outlets would also be closed.  Online train tickets between Hong Kong and Shenzhen on the mainland were displayed as sold out from 2.30 p.m.-6.30 p.m. (0630 GMT-1030 GMT), coinciding with the hours of the protest.  Hong Kong broadcaster RTHK said more than 1,000 police officers would be on standby. Police said on Sunday some roads would be closed temporarily and public transport would be diverted.  Hong Kong’s Tourism Association has also said some travel agencies would stay away from the fashionable Tsim Sha Tsui area, popular with mainland visitors, on Sunday.  Organisers have produced witty advertisements to urge people to join the march. “Dear magicians, if you were unable to turn the cold-hearted into warm-hearted, take to the streets with us on July 7,” said one.  The extradition bill, which has left Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam clinging to her job, would cover Hong Kong residents and foreign and Chinese nationals living or travelling through the city.  Lawyers and rights groups say China’s justice system is marked by torture, forced confessions and arbitrary detention, claims that Beijing denies. Protesters want the bill withdrawn altogether.  Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including freedom to protest and an independent judiciary.  Lam has offered closed-door talks to students from two universities but activists said they want the discussions to be open to the public and called for a halt to investigations of protesters. Police began arresting protesters this week.  Nearly 2,000 people marched in the northwestern residential district of Tuen Mun on Saturday to protest against middle-aged mainland women they accused of brashly singing and dancing to pop songs in Putonghua, a Beijing dialect of Mandarin Chinese.

Hundreds of protesters broke into the Hong Kong legislature on Monday after a demonstration marking the anniversary of the return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that includes freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including the right to protest.     That followed weeks of protests against a now-suspended extradition bill that opponents say would undermine Hong Kong’s much-cherished rule of law and give Beijing powers to prosecute activists in mainland courts, which are controlled by the Communist Party.  China has stepped up a war of words with Britain over Hong Kong, especially after Hunt warned of consequences if China neglects commitments made when it took back Hong Kong to allow its way of life for at least 50 years.  State media in particular has blamed London, Washington and other Western capitals for offering succour to the demonstrators.  “Ideologues in Western governments never cease in their efforts to engineer unrest against governments that are not to their liking, even though their actions have caused misery and chaos in country after country in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia,” the official China Daily said in an editorial.  “Now they are trying the same trick in China,” the English-language newspaper said.  Hunt, speaking to BBC radio, reiterated his condemnation of the violence.  “Let me be clear what I said. I said that I condemned, and we as the United Kingdom condemn, all violence and that people who supported the pro-democracy demonstrators would have been very dismayed by the scenes they saw,” said Hunt, who is vying to become Britain’s next prime minister.  China has said Britain has no more responsibility for Hong Kong. Britain says it still considers the Joint Declaration in 1984 on the terms of the return of Hong Kong, which guarantees its freedoms, to be valid.  “I don’t think it’s a big surprise that China would react that way but they need to understand that Britain is a country that honors its international obligations and what I was saying was something very uncontroversial, actually, which is that we signed an agreement in 1984 which lasts for 50 years and we would expect all sides to honor that agreement,” Hunt said.  “Hong Kong has an independent judiciary and it’s not for me as foreign secretary of the UK to second guess how that judiciary works. What I was saying was that there would be serious consequences if the legally binding international agreement between the UK and China, if that was violated.”  On Wednesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May also said China must respect the rights and freedoms of people in Hong Kong and that she had been in touch with Beijing to raise concerns.  Hunt warned on Tuesday of consequences if China did not abide by the Sino-British Joint Declaration. His comments were met by a sharp rebuke from China’s ambassador to the UK, who told Britain to keep its hands off Hong Kong.  Speaking at a daily news briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang did not offer any new criticism about Britain having the day before accused Hunt of being “shameless” for his remarks on Hong Kong.  “For the time being today, I’ll restrain myself and won’t say anymore. But if certain people in Britain obstinately stick to the wrong path, and keep repeating their mistakes, then I fear I may have more to say.”  Widespread damage inside the Legislative Council building, where protesters smashed furniture and daubed graffiti over chamber walls, forced the government to close it for two weeks.   The Legislative Council Commission is due to hold a closed-door special meeting at an undisclosed venue later on Thursday.   The China Daily accused Western forces of instigating unrest against Hong Kong’s government “as a means to put pressure on the central government”.  “The violent behavior that these Western agitators are emboldening tramples on the rule of law in Hong Kong and undermines its social order,” it said.  An editorial in the widely read tabloid The Global Times, published by the Communist Party’s People’s Daily, criticized Hunt’s comments and said “the UK’s diplomacy toward China will pay for his behavior”.

Plumes of smoke billowed among gleaming sky-scrapers early on Tuesday as police fired tear gas to disperse protesters in the heart of the Chinese-ruled city, home to the offices of some of the world’s biggest companies, including global bank HSBC.  Escalating unrest over a controversial extradition bill, which would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial, grabbed global headlines and clouded the former British colony’s outlook as a finance hub, one of the city’s main pillars of growth.   “I think there will be damage to the reputation of Hong Kong,” said Yumi Yung, 35, who works in fintech. “Some companies may want to leave Hong Kong, or at least not have their headquarters here.”  Around 1,500 multinational companies make Hong Kong their Asian home because of its stability and rule of law. Some of the biggest and most violent protests in decades could change that perception.  Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including freedom to protest and an independent judiciary. Monday was the 22nd anniversary.  Beijing denies interfering but, for many Hong Kong residents, the extradition bill is the latest step in a relentless march towards mainland control. Many fear it would put them at the mercy of courts controlled by the Communist Party where human rights are not guaranteed.  “If this bill is not completely scrapped, I will have no choice but to leave my home, Hong Kong,” said Steve, a British lawyer who has worked in Hong Kong for 30 years.  Daniel Yim, a 27-year-old investment banker, said both sides needed to sit down and work things out.   “I think the most effective way to address this will be that the government will ... actually tackle this and speak to the people, and I guess, you know, both sides sit together and come up with ... the appropriate solution.”       Others raised concerns about the future of human rights and the judiciary. Many did not want to use their full names.  “To me, the biggest worry is how Hong Kong is losing its independence bit by bit and is getting dangerously close to a country that doesn’t value human rights and that doesn’t have an independent judicial system,” said Edward, an Australian citizen who has worked in the financial sector for 10 years.  The extradition bill, now suspended but not scrapped, has also spooked some tycoons into moving their personal wealth offshore, according to financial advisers familiar with the details.  An Australian businesswoman who has worked in Hong Kong for 16 years lamented what she saw as Beijing’s tightening grip.   “China is just taking away more and more freedom from Hong Kong,” she said.  “I feel sorry for Hong Kong people, especially Hong Kong people ... (here) for more freedom, a better economy, a better life, and now it’s going backwards,” the woman said.   Such concerns came as China’s top newspaper warned on Wednesday that outbreaks of lawlessness could damage Hong Kong’s reputation and seriously hurt its economy.  Calm has returned for now, but the events of recent weeks have set many people thinking.   “If it had escalated, I would consider moving elsewhere,” a 44-year-old hedge fund manager said of the ransacking of the legislature. “I employ four to five people in Hong Kong so yes, I would consider moving.” 	Reuters

Alexandra Wong, 63, who has smaller Union Jack flags pinned to her clothes and bags, has been on the front lines of mass protests in the former British colony and sometimes in tense standoffs between police and student activists.   “I bought them in Shenzhen,” a smiling Wong, known affectionately as grandma, told Reuters of the flags, referring to the southern Chinese city across the border where she now lives.  “I had to ask secretly, because they only showed the Chinese flag. So I asked them if they had the British flag and they take it out to show me. If you don’t ask, they don’t show.”   Wong has joined millions in recent weeks who have taken to the streets to demonstrate against an extradition bill that would allow people in Hong Kong to be sent for trial in mainland China, where human rights are not guaranteed.  Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee of freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent judiciary and right to protest, for at least 50 years.  Grandma Wong has been one of the few demonstrators over 30 to stay sometimes into the early hours to show her support for thousands of activists, many of whom joined 79 days of “Umbrella” protests in 2014 pushing unsuccessfully for full democracy for one of the most densely populated cities on earth.  “I stand with Hong Kong’s future. I worry about Hong Kong youth,” she said.     Some protesters have taken to waving the Union Jack during recent protests, certain to rile authorities in Beijing, and a colonial-era flag, including the Union Jack, was unfurled when protesters stormed into the legislature on Monday night.  “I miss colonial times. The British colonial time was so good for us. I saw the future,” Wong said.   Wong grew up in Sham Shui Po, one of Hong Kong’s poorest areas, but was forced to flee to Shenzhen 13 years ago when she could no longer afford to live in one of the world’s most expensive housing markets.  “I don’t like to live there, of course. It makes me sad all the time, but I cannot live in Hong Kong,” said Wong, whose commute back and forth for protests can sometimes take five hours and costs her more than HK$100 ($12.80).  The activist wears T-shirts in support of Hong Kong democracy when she travels into the city but changes back into plain clothes when she returns home, so as not to draw scrutiny.  “I have no kids. That’s why I am not scared at all,” she said. “I don’t have any worries about anyone. I just care about the future of Hong Kong youth.”  Britain told China to honor its commitments to protect freedoms in Hong Kong on Tuesday. China has said Hong Kong is no longer any of its business.

A representative of China’s Hong Kong affairs office denounced the demonstrators, who are furious about proposed legislation allowing extraditions to China, and said Beijing supports holding criminals responsible, state media said.  The former British colony of Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including freedom to protest and an independent judiciary.  Monday was the 22nd anniversary of the handover.  Beijing denies interfering, but for many Hong Kong residents, the extradition bill is the latest step in a relentless march toward mainland control.  “Seriously violating the law, the act tramples the rule of law in Hong Kong, undermines social order and the fundamental interests of Hong Kong, and is an undisguised challenge to the bottom line of ‘one country, two systems’, Xinhua news agency quoted a Hong Kong affairs office spokesman as saying. “We strongly condemn this act.”  Debris including umbrellas, hard hats and water bottles was among the few signs left of the mayhem that had engulfed parts of the city on Monday and overnight after protesters stormed and ransacked the Legislative Council, or mini-parliament.  Police cleared roads near the heart of the financial center, paving the way for business to return to normal.  However, government offices, where protesters smashed computers and spray-painted “anti-extradition” and slurs against the police and government on chamber walls, were closed.  The government’s executive council meeting was due to be held in Government House, officials said, while the legislature would remain closed for the next two weeks.   Millions of people have taken to the streets in the past few weeks to protest against the now-suspended extradition bill that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.  Lawyers and rights groups say China’s justice system is marked by torture, forced confessions and arbitrary detention. China has been angered by Western criticism of the bill.  The bill triggered a backlash against Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, taking in the business, diplomatic and legal communities that fear corrosion of the legal autonomy of Hong Kong and the difficulty of guaranteeing a fair trial in China.  She has suspended the bill and said it would lapse next year, but protesters want it scrapped altogether and have pressed her to step down.  Lam, Hong Kong’s self-styled Iron Lady, has created a fresh crisis for Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is already grappling with a trade war with Washington, a faltering economy and tension in the South China Sea.  Regina Ip, chairwoman of Hong Kong’s pro-China New People’s Party, said the protests had brought shame on Hong Kong.  “In the long term, (this) will impact Hong Kong’s business environment. I believe various negative consequences of damages in our economy and prosperity will soon emerge.”  Starry Lee, chairwoman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, also condemned the violence.  “This is an insult to LegCo (Legislative Council), an insult to Hong Kong rule of law,” she said.  Chinese censors have worked hard to erase or block news of the Hong Kong protests, wary that any large public rallies could inspire protests on the mainland.  Screens went black on the BBC and CNN when they showed related reports in mainland China, as has happened during previous Hong Kong protests. Foreign news channels are only available in luxury hotels and a handful of high-end apartment complexes in China.  State news agency Xinhua wrote an upbeat Chinese-language report about a government-arranged concert in Hong Kong to celebrate the handover anniversary, complete with descriptions of the audience singing the national anthem and how the performers showed their “ardent love of the motherland”.  A state newspaper in China called for “zero tolerance” after the violence in Hong Kong.  “Out of blind arrogance and rage, protesters showed a complete disregard for law and order,” the Global Times, published by the Communist Party’s People’s Daily, said in an editorial.  The protests generated lively discussion on Chinese social media.   “Hong Kong shows that China cannot follow a Western political system. It’s too easy to be manipulated and to bring chaos,” wrote one user of the Twitter-like Weibo.  Another wrote, “When the children don’t listen, their mothers should give them a smacked bottom.”  Britain warned China that there would be serious consequences if the Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong was not honored. China has dismissed Britain’s concerns, saying Hong Kong was none of its business.  The U.N. human rights office in Geneva called on all sides to avoid violence.  “We ask protesters to demonstrate and express their grievances in a peaceful manner,” spokeswoman Marta Hurtado  said in an email. “We urge HK authorities to immediately open a proper channel for dialogue and for the police and other members of the security forces to manage demonstrations according to international human rights norms and standards.” 	Reuters

Police cleared roads near the heart of the financial center, paving the way for business to return to normal.  However, government offices, where protesters smashed computers and spray-painted “anti-extradition” and slurs against the police and government on chamber walls, were closed.  The government’s executive council meeting was due to be held in Government House, officials said, while the legislature would remain closed for the next two weeks.   Millions of people have taken to the streets in the past few weeks to protest against the now-suspended extradition bill that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.  Lawyers and rights groups say China’s justice system is marked by torture, forced confessions and arbitrary detention. China has been angered by Western criticism of the bill.  The bill triggered a backlash against Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, taking in the business, diplomatic and legal communities that fear corrosion of the legal autonomy of Hong Kong and the difficulty of guaranteeing a fair trial in China.  She has suspended the bill and said it would lapse next year, but protesters want it scrapped altogether and have pressed her to step down.  Lam, Hong Kong’s self-styled Iron Lady, has created a fresh crisis for Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is already grappling with a trade war with Washington, a faltering economy and tension in the South China Sea.  Regina Ip, chairwoman of Hong Kong’s pro-China New People’s Party, said the protests had brought shame on Hong Kong.  “In the long term, (this) will impact Hong Kong’s business environment. I believe various negative consequences of damages in our economy and prosperity will soon emerge.”  Starry Lee, chairwoman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, also condemned the violence.  “This is an insult to LegCo (Legislative Council), an insult to Hong Kong rule of law,” she said.  Chinese censors have worked hard to erase or block news of the Hong Kong protests, wary that any large public rallies could inspire protests on the mainland.  Screens went black on the BBC and CNN when they showed related reports in mainland China, as has happened during previous Hong Kong protests. Foreign news channels are only available in luxury hotels and a handful of high-end apartment complexes in China.  State news agency Xinhua wrote an upbeat Chinese-language report about a government-arranged concert in Hong Kong to celebrate the handover anniversary, complete with descriptions of the audience singing the national anthem and how the performers showed their “ardent love of the motherland”.  A state newspaper in China called for “zero tolerance” after the violence in Hong Kong.  “Out of blind arrogance and rage, protesters showed a complete disregard for law and order,” the Global Times, published by the Communist Party’s People’s Daily, said in an editorial.  The protests generated lively discussion on Chinese social media.   “Hong Kong shows that China cannot follow a Western political system. It’s too easy to be manipulated and to bring chaos,” wrote one user of the Twitter-like Weibo.  Another wrote, “When the children don’t listen, their mothers should give them a smacked bottom.”  Britain warned China that there would be serious consequences if the Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong was not honored. China has dismissed Britain’s concerns, saying Hong Kong was none of its business.  The U.N. human rights office in Geneva called on all sides to avoid violence.  “We ask protesters to demonstrate and express their grievances in a peaceful manner,” spokeswoman Marta Hurtado  said in an email. “We urge HK authorities to immediately open a proper channel for dialogue and for the police and other members of the security forces to manage demonstrations according to international human rights norms and standards.” 	Reuters

The tactic mystified former Hong Kong police officers as they watched coverage of hundreds of protesters, mostly students in hard hats and masks, roaming the plush, multistorey complex, vandalizing furniture and daubing graffiti over the walls.   The demonstrators broke computers, spray-painted slurs against police on chamber walls and used road signs, scaffolding and metal poles to trash fittings.  “What were they thinking when they decided to let them into the Legislative Council?” asked Chris Pedder, a retired 22-year veteran of the Hong Kong police who now works as a counter terrorism and security consultant.   “I can’t think of any tactical reason for doing this. It is just staggering.”   A group of protesters, mostly younger people clad in black, had earlier besieged the building, while an estimated crowd of hundreds of thousands marched largely peacefully against a proposed extradition law that has plunged the city into turmoil.  The former British colony returned to China in 1997 with a guarantee of freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including freedom to protest and an independent legal system. Monday was the 22nd anniversary.  The violence was not shown on the mainland where Communist Party censors have blocked news of the Hong Kong protests, wary that any large public rallies could inspire demonstrations closer to home.  TV screens went black on the BBC and CNN when they showed related reports in mainland China. Foreign news channels are only available in luxury hotels and a handful of high-end apartment complexes in China.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, saying she had heard people “loud and clear”, suspended the extradition bill, which would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial, but stopped short of protesters’ demands to scrap it.   Opponents of the bill fear it would place them at the mercy of a justice system plagued by torture, forced confessions and arbitrary detentions.  In stark contrast to the peaceful demonstration in nearby streets marking the handover anniversary, protesters surrounding the Legislative Council used metal posts to hammer at the doors and windows and repeatedly rammed steel trolleys into glass panels.  Sections of the reinforced glass splintered, sagged and eventually gave way and a group of demonstrators burst inside.   Hong Kong pro-democracy leader Martin Lee said he believed the authorities had allowed Monday’s protest to take place.   “When the protesters entered, the police just suddenly dispersed. Have you ever seen this in any country in any city where an important building, like the Legislative Council building, was attacked and the police were actually present and they didn’t think to stop it to begin with?” Lee told BBC radio.      “No government would tolerate a building being attacked with the police sitting there and doing nothing.”  Hong Kong Police Commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung explained at a press conference early on Tuesday that his officers inside the building had been under assault for eight hours before they were withdrawn at about 9 p.m.   By that time, about 30,000 protesters were gathered outside, he said.  Lo said some protesters had thrown a toxic powder on some of his officers and others had attempted to interfere with the electrical system. Without lights, it would have been difficult and dangerous for his officers to use normal forceful measures in such a confined space.  “That is why we left to reconsider our plans,” Lo said.  Steve Vickers, a former commander of the Royal Hong Kong Police Criminal Intelligence Bureau who now runs a risk consultancy, said while the police had displayed extraordinary restraint, their tactics were “suspect”.  “Few world governments would have capitulated on such a scale and handed the de facto parliament building to agitators and hard-core demonstrators under such circumstances,” Vickers said. “It must always be remembered that in the unlikely event of the police being perceived as not holding the line, that the only alternative would be direct mainland intervention.”   The police and government issued a series of statements condemning the occupation but it was not until midnight that a convoy of buses pulled up on an approach road to the complex and disgorged hundreds of officers in riot gear.   They took up positions across the road, forming a wall with their riot shields and advanced toward the first barricade about 100 meters east of the Legislative Council, shouting at protesters to move back.    In contrast with clashes last month with demonstrators protesting against the extradition bill, this time the crowds just melted away when police fired a few canisters of tear gas.   There was very little resistance and police did not appear to make any arrests as they pushed the protesters back and cleared the building.    Within an hour, the streets around the complex were empty. All that remained where piles of trash, broken umbrellas and thousands of plastic ties that the protesters used to bind barricades together.  That part of the operation drew praise from former police.   “It was a flawless demonstration of proportionate crowd control tactics,” said Pedder. “It made me proud to have worn the same uniform.”  However, the failure to arrest protesters inside the building means that police will now need to spend months or even years poring over footage of the protest to identify and prosecute suspects, according to current and former officers.

706	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1TX0H5	July 2, 2019 /  5:07 AM / 9 months ago	Breakingviews - Hong Kong protesters score Pyrrhic victory	HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Hong Kong protesters triumphantly took over the city’s legislature, but there is little to celebrate. Amid another march against a controversial extradition plan, a furious faction broke into the empty building on Monday night and trashed it, deepening a crisis for Chief Executive Carrie Lam. The violence will weaken some of the movement’s support, spook big business and could give Beijing a pretext to dig in.    On the 22nd anniversary of Britain handing Hong Kong back to China, graffiti covered the central chamber of the Legislative Council and a colonial-era flag was draped across the podium. Crowds stormed the site before police used tear gas to force them to disperse. The shocking images broadcast around the world were a stark contrast to earlier more peaceful demonstrations, where massive crowds parted politely to allow buses and ambulances to pass.   The leaderless group made its demands loud and clear. In a 4 a.m. response, Lam condemned the vandalism after an earlier government statement stressed that her proposal is effectively on ice. The fracas will nevertheless make it tougher for her to see out her term. At best, she is a lame duck.  Radical protesters, however, risk alienating both local and foreign supporters. Some 1,500 multinational companies that make Hong Kong their Asian home, and who prize stability and security along with the rule of law, are also bound to consider whether Singapore or some other city might be a better hub.  Meanwhile, protesters hoping to embolden Hong Kong’s special status may have just diluted it. Mainland authorities, who have been preoccupied with U.S. trade talks and other pressing issues, could soon become more hands-on. They now have a ready excuse to justify tightening their grip – perhaps by expanding its main representative in the city, the Central Liaison Office, as they did following protests in 2003 and 2014.  Lam’s botched bill and her handling of the backlash have divided pro-Beijing legislators and infuriated their opponents, some of whom could become more radical. That will leave the city’s next leader in an even tighter spot. None of it adds up to a clear win. Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

However, many fear Beijing’s tightening grip over the city.  Beijing denies interfering but, for many Hong Kong residents, the extradition bill is the latest step in a relentless march towards mainland control.  The self-ruled island of Taiwan, which is overwhelmingly opposed to a “one country, two systems” formula for itself, has voiced support for Hong Kong.  “On the 22nd anniversary of #HongKong’s handover, citizens are seething with anger & frustration,” Taiwan’s Foreign Affairs Minister Joseph Wu said on his Twitter account late on Monday.  “It’s clear the CCP regime’s ‘one country, two systems’ is nothing but a lie. I urge the global community to support the people’s struggle for freedom & fully democratic elections,” he said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.

Beijing-backed Lam called a news conference at 4 a.m. (2000 GMT Monday) to condemn what were some of the most violent protests to rock the city in decades.  She is now clinging to her job at a time of an unprecedented backlash against the government that poses the greatest popular challenge to Xi since he came to power in 2012. 	Reuters

Protesters tried to storm Hong Kong’s legislature on the anniversary of the city’s 1997 return to Chinese rule on Monday, using a metal trolley and poles to smash windows amid anger over planned legislation that would allow extraditions to China.  China two years ago announced that it considered the joint declaration, which laid the blueprint over how the city would be ruled after its return to China, was a historical document that no longer had any practical significance.  Britain says the declaration remains in force and is a legally valid treaty to which it is committed to upholding, a point repeated by British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt on Sunday.  Ahead of the 22nd anniversary of the handover on Monday, Hunt also said that recent protests over the extradition bill made it even more important to reiterate that Britain’s commitment to the Sino-British Joint Declaration was unwavering.  Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said that Britain’s rights and obligations under the joint declaration had ended.   “Britain has no so-called responsibility for Hong Kong. Hong Kong matters are purely an internal affair for China. No foreign country has a right to interfere,” Geng told a daily news briefing.  “Recently Britain has continuously gesticulated about Hong Kong, flagrantly interfering. We are extremely dissatisfied with this and resolutely opposed,” he added.   “We urge Britain to know its place and stop interfering in any form in Hong Kong matters and do more for its prosperity and stability rather than the opposite.” 	Reuters

Holding placards with messages such as “Please liberate Hong Kong”, the demonstrators, some wearing masks, marched to consulates of major economies represented at the Japan summit, including the host nation, Britain, Canada, Russia, the United States and the European Union.  “This is the first time so many march to so many consulates to express a single view,” said one of the organizers of the march, who gave only his surname, Lau.  Millions have protested in recent weeks against the bill that would allow individuals, including foreigners, to be extradited to mainland China to face trial in courts controlled by its ruling Communist Party.  Hong Kong’s Beijing-appointed leader Carrie Lam eventually caved in after some of the worst violence seen in decades on the city’s streets, with police firing tear gas and rubber bullets.  But Lam stopped short of protesters’ demands to scrap the bill altogether, saying it would be suspended indefinitely.  The day culminated in several thousand, mostly young activists, surrounding police headquarters, using metal barricades to blockade entrances. Many donned helmets, masks and goggles, as they cursed Hong Kong’s police chief for what they say was a brutal clampdown on some protests in recent weeks.  They also spray-painted and pelted eggs at the building, while occupying nearby roads.  “It’s hard to ask people to come out again. So once we are out, we won’t retreat,” said Joe Yeung, one of the activists.    Since Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, it has been governed under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows it freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including the liberty to protest and an independent judiciary.  But many accuse China of increased meddling over the years, by obstructing democratic reform, interfering with elections, suppressing young activists, as well as being behind the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers who specialized in works critical of Chinese leaders.  Protesters earlier handed a petition to the U.S. consulate asking President Donald Trump to “Back Hong Kong at the G20 Summit,” where he is due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping to try to defuse trade tension.  They urged Trump to back a full withdrawal of the bill and an independent inquiry into the actions of Hong Kong police against protesters.  They also marched to the British consulate, where a man held up a sign reading, “Free HK from China colonization.”   Britain’s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told parliament on Tuesday that London would ban sales of tear gas to Hong Kong and called for an independent inquiry into the recent violence, a gesture welcomed by some in the crowd.  In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang urged Britain not to interfere in China’s internal affairs.  “Britain has repeatedly made irresponsible remarks and flagrantly interfered with regards to Hong Kong,” he told a daily briefing. “China expresses its strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to this.”   At the evening gathering on the edge of the Central financial district, thousands of activists - many wearing black - spoke, sang and urged G20 leaders to defend Hong Kong’s rights, holding up a giant banner with the words “Free Hong Kong. Democracy Now.”  Raising the extradition saga at the summit could embarrass Xi at a delicate time of rising trade tension with the United States, and further pressure Hong Kong’s leader amid reports that Beijing has doubts about Lam’s capabilities.  Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun has said China would not allow discussion of Hong Kong at the summit.  But many remained defiant.  “Hong Kong has been standing at the frontline of authoritarianism and autocracy. It’s important that we are united,” said veteran democrat Lee Cheuk-yan.  In a crowdfunding campaign, Hong Kong activists have raised more than HK$5 million ($640,606) to take out newspaper ads in major foreign media during the summit..   Some Hong Kong activists have also journeyed to Osaka. 	Reuters

Millions of people have clogged the streets of the former British colony in recent weeks to rally against the bill, which would allow people to be extradited to the mainland to face trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.   Hong Kong police this month fired rubber bullets and tear gas at people taking part in the protests - the largest since crowds demonstrated against the bloody suppression of pro-democracy activists in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in June 1989.  The protests, which effectively pitched thousands of often young Hong Kong residents into a standoff with the increasingly mighty Chinese state, are the greatest popular challenge to President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012.  “What happens in Hong Kong is, I think for all of us, a litmus test of the direction of travel that China goes in,” Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, one of the two contenders to be the next British prime minister, told parliament.  “I today urge the Hong Kong ... government to establish a robust, independent investigation into the violent scenes that we saw,” Hunt said.  Britain, he said, would issue no more export licenses for crowd-control equipment to Hong Kong until it was satisfied its concerns on human rights and fundamental freedoms had been thoroughly addressed.  “The outcome of that investigation will inform our assessment of future export license applications to the Hong Kong police,” Hunt said.   Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 and has since been governed under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows it freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including freedom to protest and a much-cherished independent judiciary.  “We will stand by that agreement and we expect China to do the same,” Hunt said.   “The fundamental freedoms of Hong Kong are what have made it such a stunning success since 1997 and indeed before 1997 - anything that contradicted the letter or spirit of the basic law that preserves them should not happen,” Hunt added.  Many in Hong Kong accuse China of extensive meddling, including obstruction of democratic reforms, interference with local elections and of being behind the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers, starting in 2015, who specialized in works critical of Chinese leaders.

Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 and has since been governed under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows it freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including freedom to protest and a much-cherished independent judiciary.  “We will stand by that agreement and we expect China to do the same,” Hunt said.   “The fundamental freedoms of Hong Kong are what have made it such a stunning success since 1997 and indeed before 1997 - anything that contradicted the letter or spirit of the basic law that preserves them should not happen,” Hunt added.  Many in Hong Kong accuse China of extensive meddling, including obstruction of democratic reforms, interference with local elections and of being behind the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers, starting in 2015, who specialized in works critical of Chinese leaders.  Chinese censors have been working hard to erase or block news of the Hong Kong protests.  	Reuters

Millions have taken to the streets of the former British colony this month to protest against the bill, that would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial, plunging the city into political crisis and posing a grave challenge to Communist Party rulers in Beijing.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam suspended the bill in a dramatic climbdown, saying she had heard the protesters “loud and clear”, but the activists are demanding the bill be scrapped altogether.  “We now need your support: get our voices heard at your governments and consulates; let freedom prevail at the upcoming G20 summit and beyond,” a draft of an ad that appeared on the group’s gogetfunding.com page said.  “We can be saved, if you act now,” said the ad, which was signed Hong Kong Citizens, Vanguards of Freedom.  G20 leaders meet in the Japanese city of Osaka this week. The Hong Kong protesters plan another demonstration on Wednesday to raise awareness among world leaders ahead of the summit.  The campaign is certain to rile Beijing, after Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun said China would not allow the G20 nations to discuss Hong Kong.  Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, since when it has been governed under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including freedom to protest and an independent judiciary.  But many accuse China of increased meddling over the years, obstructing democratic reforms, interfering with elections and of being behind the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers who specialised in works critical of Chinese leaders.  Opponents of the extradition bill fear it would put them at the mercy of Chinese courts, controlled by the Communist Party, with a record of arbitrary detentions, torture and other human rights violations.  More than 22,000 people had raised HK$5.5 million within hours of the crowdfunding campaign’s launch, exceeding a HK$3 million target.  Any money left over from the ad campaign would go towards funding of activists arrested during the protests, the group said.  There were chaotic scenes this month when police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters near the heart of the financial centre, which was gripped by 79 days of pro-democracy “Umbrella” protests in 2014.  The Civil Human Rights Front, organizer of this month’s protests, is gearing up for an annual march on July 1, the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover to Beijing. The group has called on people to turn out in force. 	Reuters

Hong Kong has been bracing for a third weekend of widespread protests against an extradition bill that has plunged the Chinese-ruled city into crisis, posing the greatest popular challenge to President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012.  On Friday groups of mostly students wearing hard hats, goggles and face masks set up roadblocks and trapped vehicles in a generally peaceful protest to demand that leader Carrie Lam, who promoted and then postponed the bill, scrap it altogether.   Police removed barricades early on Saturday morning while staff were able to go home, after a more than 15 hour blockade. Only a few hundred protesters remained.   In a statement early on Saturday, police said the acts of the protesters had seriously affected their work including the provision of emergency services to the public.  “Police have shown the greatest tolerance to the protesters...but their means of expressing views have become illegal, irrational and unreasonable. Police will stringently follow up on these illegal activities.”  Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, since when it has been governed under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including a much-cherished independent judiciary.

But the victory has come at an uncertain cost for 24 people arrested during the largely peaceful demonstrations, with the government saying those at the frontline, charging at police with umbrellas for instance, would be shown no clemency.  Thirty-two were arrested in total and eight cases were dropped, police said. They did not give details of the charges.  The arrests have further enraged many protesters who are demanding the government drop the cases and stop referring to the protests as a riot, which could lead to heavier jail terms.  The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula, which guaranteed its freedoms, including freedom to protest and an independent legal system, which many say are being slowly eroded by Communist Party rulers in Beijing.  Demonstrators on Friday focused much of their anger on police as they surrounded their headquarters.  “Our kids are beaten by police, by tear gas and rubber bullets. Stop shooting our children,” some shouted.  In a departure from Hong Kong’s 2014 pro-democracy “Occupy” protests, which gridlocked parts of the city for 79 days, these protesters managed to mobilize several million people on to the streets thanks in part to social media and encrypted messaging apps like Telegram.  Unlike Whatsapp, which has limits on group size, Telegram allowed the instant formation of vast communities of resistance, marshaled by anonymous administrators.  But police were watching.       Ivan Ip, a 22-year-old student and one of the administrators of a Telegram group with more than 30,000 users, was arrested on public nuisance charges.      Police raided his home, he said, before a protest that saw riot police fire 150 rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets.       Police confirmed to Reuters that they arrested a 22-year-old man after an investigation by the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau, without giving details.  Ip said he had only been disseminating information shared by anonymous users and didn’t participate in any protest.  Police forced him to reveal his password to unlock his phone, downloaded data and asked him questions about how the Telegram group functions, Ip said.  Police did not respond to a request for comment.   “Police do not have the right to force people to give the password for them. There’s a precedent in high court that states very clearly that there’s no need to give passwords to the police,” said solicitor Ng Gene Bond.  Telegram, banned in Russia and mainland China, is one of the most targeted encrypted apps by Chinese censors, according to industry experts.  Telegram’s chief executive, Pavel Durov, said its service experienced a “state actor-sized” cyber-attack as the protests in Hong Kong escalated on June 12.  He declined to elaborate when contacted by Reuters.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam apologized for the turmoil caused by the planned extradition legislation and said she had heard the people “loud and clear”.  But protester Jason Chan, charged with unlawful assembly and now on bail, said a government apology was not enough.   “If most citizens are peaceful protesters, why is such kind of force being used against them?” 	Reuters
717	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1TJ16T	June 18, 2019 /  10:52 AM / 9 months ago	'Sing Hallelujah to the Lord' an unlikely anthem of Hong Kong protests	 (This June 18 story corrects to say song originated from Christian, not Catholic groups)  By Jessie Pang and Marius Zaharia  HONG KONG (Reuters) - The Christian hymn “Sing Hallelujah to the Lord” has emerged as the unlikely anthem of Hong Kong’s protests against an extradition bill that have drawn millions of people onto the streets.  Protests around the world often develop their own soundtrack, usually songs with lyrics of defiance and solidarity, aiming to keep crowds energized and focused.  But the hymn taken up in Hong Kong hardly ticks those boxes.  For the past week, the hymn has been heard almost non-stop at the main protest site, in front of the city’s Legislative Council, and at marches and even at tense stand-offs with the police.  It started with a group of Christian students who sang several religious songs at the main protest site, with “Sing Hallelujah to the Lord” catching on among the crowd, even though only about 10 percent of Hong Kong people are Christian.  “This was the one people picked up, as it is easy for people to follow, with a simple message and easy melody,” said Edwin Chow, 19, acting president of the Hong Kong Federation of Catholic Students.  The students sang the songs in the hope of providing a cover of legitimacy for the protest. Religious gatherings can be held without a permit in the financial hub.  “As religious assemblies were exempt, it could protect the protesters. It also shows that it is a peaceful protest,” Chow said.  The hymn was composed in 1974 by Linda Stassen-Benjamin in the United States for Easter. Its five words are repeated over four stanzas in a minor key, which gives it an air of meditative solemnity.  The protests over the past 10 days have been largely peaceful although police on Wednesday last week used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowds.  “Stop shooting, or else we sing ‘Hallelujah to the Lord’,” read one protest placard after the rubber bullets were fired.  Protesters say the religious song has often helped defuse tension with the police.  “It has a calming effect,” said Timothy Lam, 58, a pastor at Grace Church Hong Kong, who has attended the protest with other churchmen to promote peace.  “The police had a lot of equipment, they were very tense and searching people. The students sang this to show they were peaceful,” Lam said of a confrontation last week.  Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed government leader, Carrie Lam, has postponed the introduction of the extradition bill and apologized in the face of the huge show of opposition.  Critics say the law would undermine Hong Kong’s independent judiciary and rule of law, guaranteed by a “one country, two systems” formula under which the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  Carrie Lam is Catholic and some protesters said they thought their adoption of “Sing Hallelujah to the Lord” might have helped sway her.  “She is Catholic after all, it’s one of the main reasons we sing it,” said Jamie, an 18-year old student who is not Catholic.

718	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1TK07S	June 19, 2019 /  5:04 AM / 10 months ago	Breakingviews - Hadas: Hong Kong teaches lessons on taming China	LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Some 2 million people in Hong Kong have forced China into a political retreat. The experience teaches lessons for another billion folks living in developed economies.  A decision to put on hold indefinitely a proposal to allow extraditions from the Asian financial hub to the mainland makes clear that the world’s second largest economy is vulnerable to the right kind of pressure. Hong Kong’s relationship with China is unique, but protesters relied on five globally replicable steps.  First, set specific and realistic goals. Hong Kong residents would prefer much greater autonomy, but many of them also recognise that China is not about to discuss a broad structural change. Carrie Lam, the city’s reeling chief executive, faced only a simple demand, one her political masters in the People’s Republic could conceivably accept.  Second, unify popular resistance. The autocratic Chinese authorities learned from Lenin about the fearsome power of the masses. That is why they dedicate so many resources to squelching seditious thoughts and to stirring up politically expedient popular resentment. Government cannot override the strong desires of too many of their people.  Third, use economic leverage. As my colleague Pete Sweeney pointed out, the Hong Kong economy would suffer greatly if foreign governments decided to classify it as fully Chinese. The realistic prospect of a painful reprisal probably encouraged Xi Jinping, China’s leader, to give Lam his blessing on a compromise.  Fourth, reasonably balance disruption and destruction. There were some blockages in Hong Kong’s central business district, and the police used tear gas and rubber bullets in response to some rock-throwing. Demonstrators, however, were largely peaceful and careful not to give authorities an excuse to respond violently.  Finally, minimise propaganda. Apart from a small radical minority, Hong Kong’s protesters did not insult China’s ruling Communist Party or mock “Xi Jinping thought”. On the contrary, they gave the Chinese authorities an opportunity to show they are constructive actors who respect legitimate requests. The Party can turn its retreat into a narrative of pragmatic success.  The traditional power elites outside China, corporate as well as political, should study this playbook carefully. They will have to learn how to deal with the country from a position of relative weakness. After all, by 2030, China’s population will be 11% higher than all developed economies put together, the UN Population Division estimates. Barring a miracle elsewhere or a disaster in China, whoever is in power in Beijing will be in position to set the global economic agenda.  That will be a sea change from the China of a generation ago, a country whose leaders were almost desperate for foreign markets, technology and expertise. The transition has already started, and it looks like the United States, the soon-to-be-former global hegemon, has a lot to learn.  President Donald Trump’s administration at least seems aware of the challenge. Indeed, it is so concerned that it has ignored the first Hong Kong lesson, by developing a diffuse and unrealistic agenda. It wants China to reduce its trade deficit with the United States by buying American goods; to stop stealing U.S. technology; to hang onto a huge portfolio of low-yielding U.S. government debt; and to accept the outdated regional balance of military and political power. Worse, there seem to be no rewards on offer for bending to the American will.  Moving down the list, Trump’s team has roused only limited popular animosity against anything Chinese. The Western internet is not overloaded with indignation about the country’s malpractice, genuine or imagined. These torpid feelings show up in the polls. While 57% of Americans expressed an overall negative view of China in a February 2019 Gallup survey, that was only 6 percentage points higher than the average over the previous decade.  As for economic leverage, China’s trading partners have a big supply, but seem unable to deploy it well. The American blitz of random tariffs and corporate controls is counterproductive. It only encourages greater Chinese efforts at self-reliance. Tough sanctions on Huawei, for example, will slow down Chinese development in telephony, but a likely result will be more intellectual property theft and a stronger company emerging a decade or so from the world’s largest market.  And although the Hong Kong protesters have worked to keep their opponents from overreacting, the Trump trade campaign seems aimed at eliciting an aggressive Chinese response. The combination of sharp economic pressure, vague demands for change and military bluster gives the rulers in Beijing every reason to respond belligerently to all American moves.  Indeed, Washington’s rhetoric indicates that there is nothing the Chinese Communist Party could ever do to earn American respect. Partly out of fear of Trump, few Western corporate chieftains speak loudly in Beijing’s favour, further reducing Sino-American trust.  It is not too late, however, to engage more constructively with China. Business leaders, who bring prosperity rather than weapons, have a head start over governments, but they need to learn how to make the best use of their limited strengths.

Yung is packing her bags and leaving the Chinese-ruled city to set up a new life in proudly democratic Taiwan, fed up with what she sees as Beijing’s ever encroaching grip over the city  that has led to an erosion of civil liberties.   “Without freedom and democracy, it’s like being put in jail, like living in a concentration camp ... without freedom, (I) would rather die,” said Yung, as she waved a Taiwan flag at a massive protest in Hong Kong on Sunday.   “Taiwan can offer that because Taiwan has democratic elections and a constitution that safeguards democracy.”  Hong Kong has been governed under a “one country, two systems” formula since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997, allowing it certain freedoms, including an independent judiciary. Courts in mainland China are controlled by the Communist Party.  Yung is joining thousands of people who have left for Taiwan in recent years, citing fears of Chinese erosion of one country, two systems, a concept Beijing hopes it can introduce  one day in Taiwan.  Beijing has never renounced the use of force to take over neighboring, self-ruled Taiwan, which it regards as a recalcitrant, breakaway province.   While Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam indefinitely suspended the extradition bill, protest organizers said about two million people still took to the streets on Sunday to call for a full withdrawal and to demand Lam step down.  Some Hong Kong tycoons have started moving personal wealth offshore amid concerns over the legislation.   The Hong Kong protests, which saw police use rubber bullets and tear gas, were the most violent to rock the city in decades and marked the biggest challenge the financial hub has posed to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.   Taiwan, overwhelmingly opposed to a “one country, two systems” formula for itself, has voiced support for Hong Kong. It has remained defiant amid escalating Chinese pressure, with many resolutely rejecting Beijing’s call for “reunification”.  The extradition bill is the latest in a string of issues that have troubled ties between Hong Kong and Beijing, with Hong Kong people increasingly upset by an inflow of Chinese immigrants and sky-high property prices partly pushed by mainland investors.  Many accuse China of extensive meddling, including obstruction of democratic reforms, interference with elections and of being behind the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers, starting in 2015, who specialized in works critical of Chinese leaders.  Chan, 30, who declined to give his full name, said the rapid pace of Beijing’s encroachment on Hong Kong’s civil liberties had taken him by surprise.   “It’s like there’s a burglar in my house and I’m the one who’s forced to leave because I couldn’t defeat him,” said Chan, who moved to Taiwan in 2016 and is planning to arrange for his parents to retire there.   The number of people granted Taiwan residency from Hong Kong and neighboring Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave also given special autonomy under Chinese rule, had more than doubled to 1,267 in 2018 from a decade ago, official data shows.  The trend spiked in the two years following massive protests calling for full democracy in 2014 that paralyzed parts of Hong Kong for months. And it shows no signs of abating. There were around 400 such immigrants to Taiwan in the first four months of 2019, a 40% jump from a year ago.   “I’m moving to Taiwan with my wife next year,” said Melvin Chu, a Hong Kong resident in his late 20s who joined Sunday’s rally, citing worries over political freedoms.     “Things are getting worse in Hong Kong. We are worried for the next generation.”   Some Hong Kong youth are so desperate to leave they have opted to join Taiwan’s compulsory military service for men under 36 in a bid to get residency, which comes at a price tag of HK$1.5 million ($191,600).   Taiwan politicians have wasted no time in showing their support for Hong Kong amid a heated presidential race in which candidates’ policies toward China are closely examined.   Seeking a second term, President Tsai Ing-wen has repeatedly urged the Hong Kong government to respect the people’s will, while sounding the alarm over Beijing’s “trap” to absorb Taiwan.  Foxconn chairman Terry Gou, seeking an opposition party’s presidential nomination, promised to “open his arms” to Hong Kong immigrants looking to find “a new home for democracy and freedom” if he became Taiwan’s next president.  “It’s a democratic beacon for Hong Kong,” Cheng Chung-man, a 32-year-old who works for a lawmaker in Hong Kong’s Legislative Council, told Reuters of Taiwan at Sunday’s rally.   “It gives Hong Kong people hope.” 	Reuters

With President Donald Trump’s trade policies heightening fears of a U.S. recession, expectations of a Fed rate cut have dramatically increased in the past month. Money market pricing became even more aggressive after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell threw open the door to a cut, promising on June 4 the Fed would act “as appropriate” to address risks from the trade dispute. It was the second sudden shift in the Fed’s tone, after January when it abandoned its bias toward steady tightening.  So when would it be appropriate for the Fed to act?  The Federal Open Market Committee might answer that question at its June 18-19 meeting. Money markets price a cut by July; by end-2019 they reckon the Fed will have cut twice at least.  The CME Group's FedWatch tool shows traders assign an 88% probability of a cut in July. They put chances of a June cut at 23%, up from around 17% a week back.

If the Fed’s pivot to full-on dovishness in a short space of time was remarkable, the U-turn by other G10 central banks is as astonishing. From Canada to Japan, developed countries are now seen cutting interest rates.  Markets’ eyes will be firmly fixed on the ECB’s annual three-day shebang in Sintra and policy meetings in Japan and Britain. It was in Sintra two years ago that Mario Draghi sparked a bond selloff by remarking on the euro zone’s “strengthening and broadening” economic recovery. Sadly, that was a false alarm; two years later Draghi is winding up his term with little sign of growth or inflation and a real likelihood of more rate cuts.  Similarly, the Bank of Japan has watched its 2% inflation target recede into the distance. As the Fed gears up to cut rates, the BOJ may have no choice but to follow suit, possibly as early as September. It could cut rates to minus 0.3% from minus 0.1%, some predict. Bank of England policymakers have been at pains to stress rate hikes are still possible. The problem is that no one believes them: markets are pricing rate cuts by next June.  Upcoming meetings will be mostly about signalling. But they may show if policymakers intend to eventually walk that talk. - ECB’s Rehn: tiering, rate cuts, more QE all on the table - Bank of Canada done raising rates, 40% chance of cut by end-2020 -Australia jobless rate fails to fall, argues for July rate cut  tmsnrt.rs/2Igfo8O  3/IT ALL DEPENDS...

Hong Kongers plan to continue protesting a proposed bill that allows people to be sent to mainland China for trial. Opponents of the bill highlight risks to human rights protections as well as the autonomy of Hong Kong’s legal system, one of its main competitive advantages.  The fear is that retail sales and tourism receipts could drop as seen during the 2014 “Umbrella” protests. But a greater problem would arise if the United States decides Hong Kong is not autonomous enough to justify the special treatment it receives — its current status shields it from import tariffs, visa rules and other curbs that apply to mainland China.  Spiralling cash demand due to the standoff has pushed interbank rates to decade-highs while HK stocks have tumbled. The backwash for Beijing too may be unpleasant — Hong Kong is a useful channel for Chinese trade, IPOs and investment.

The extradition bill, which would cover Hong Kong’s 7 million residents as well as foreign and Chinese nationals in the city, was seen by many as a threat to the rule of law in the former British colony.  (To see a live blog of coverage of the Hong Kong protests, click reut.rs/2Iajtez)  The Hong Kong government first launched the proposals in February, putting forward sweeping changes that would simplify case-by-case extraditions of criminal suspects to countries beyond the 20 with which Hong Kong has existing extradition treaties.  It explicitly allows extraditions from Hong Kong to greater China - including the mainland, Taiwan and Macau - for the first time, closing what Hong Kong government officials have repeatedly described as a “loophole” that they claim has allowed the city to become a haven for criminals from the mainland.  Hong Kong’s leader would start and finally approve an extradition following a request from a foreign jurisdiction but only after court hearings, including any possible appeals. However, the bill removes Legislative Council oversight of extradition arrangements.  If the bill becomes law, it will be possible for mainland Chinese courts to request Hong Kong courts to freeze and confiscate assets related to crimes committed on the mainland, beyond an existing provision covering the proceeds of drug offences.  Officials initially seized on the murder last year of a young Hong Kong woman holidaying in Taiwan to justify swift changes. Police say her boyfriend confessed on his return to Hong Kong and he is now in jail on lesser money-laundering charges.  Taiwan authorities have strongly opposed the bill, which they say could leave Taiwanese citizens exposed in Hong Kong and have vowed to refuse taking back the murder suspect if the bill is passed.  A long-forgotten issue, the need for an eventual extradition deal with the mainland was acknowledged by government officials and experts ahead of Hong Kong’s handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under the “one country, two systems” model.  The city maintains a separate and independent legal system as part of the broader freedoms the formula guarantees. Little progress has been made in discreet talks since then with justice and security officials on the mainland, where the Communist Party still controls the courts.  Concern about the amendments has spiraled in recent weeks, taking in pro-business and pro-Beijing elements usually loath to publicly contradict the Hong Kong or Chinese governments. Senior Hong Kong judges have privately expressed alarm, and mainland commercial lawyers based in Hong Kong have echoed their fears, saying the mainland system cannot be trusted to meet even basic standards of judicial fairness. Hong Kong lawyers’ groups have issued detailed submissions to the government, hoping to force a postponement.  Authorities have repeatedly stressed that judges will serve as “gatekeepers” or guardians for extradition requests. However, some judges say privately that China’s increasingly close relationship with Hong Kong and the limited scope of extradition hearings will leave them exposed to criticism and political pressure from Beijing.   Schools, lawyers and church groups have joined human rights groups to protest against the measures. Following a brawl in the legislature over the bill, the government moved to fast-track the bill by scrapping established legislative procedures that stoked outrage amongst critics.   Foreign political and diplomatic pressure over human rights concerns is rising, too. As well as recent statements from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his British and German counterparts, some 11 European Union envoys met Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam to protest formally.  “It’s a proposal, or a set of proposals, which strike a terrible blow ... against the rule of law, against Hong Kong’s stability and security, against Hong Kong’s position as a great international trading hub,” Hong Kong’s last British governor, Chris Patten, said on Thursday.  Some opposition politicians say the issue now represents a turning point for the city’s free status.   While Lam and her key officials have been strident in defending the bill both publicly and privately, cracks have began to appear in the support base for the law.  Several pro-Beijing politicians and a senior advisor to Lam said discussion of the bill should be shelved for the time being.  Lam has insisted that broad safeguards mean that anyone at risk of political or religious persecution or who faces torture would not be extradited. Likewise, no one who faces the death penalty would be extradited. China denies accusations of human rights abuses.  Lam said the city’s legislature would now stop all work on the bill and that the next steps would be decided after consultations with various parties. 	Reuters
725	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N23K0PS	June 14, 2019 /  1:08 PM / 10 months ago	Take Five: The Fed and the rest	(Reuters) - 1/THE FIRST CUT...  With President Donald Trump’s trade policies heightening fears of a U.S. recession, expectations of a Fed rate cut have dramatically increased in the past month. Money market pricing became even more aggressive after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell threw open the door to a cut, promising on June 4 the Fed would act “as appropriate” to address risks from the trade dispute. It was the second sudden shift in the Fed’s tone, after January when it abandoned its bias toward steady tightening.  So when would it be appropriate for the Fed to act?  The Federal Open Market Committee might answer that question at its June 18-19 meeting. Money markets price a cut by July; by end-2019 they reckon the Fed will have cut twice at least.  The CME Group’s FedWatch tool shows traders assign an 88% probability of a cut in July. They put chances of a June cut at 23%, up from around 17% a week back. Vanguard, one of the world’s largest asset managers, is one investor who reckons the Fed will announce an “insurance” interest rate cut on June 19.   (GRAPHIC: Wall Street asks when, not if, the Fed will cut rates - tmsnrt.rs/2R8CbGs)  If the Fed’s pivot to full-on dovishness in a short space of time was remarkable, the U-turn by other G10 central banks is as astonishing. From Canada to Japan, developed countries are now seen cutting interest rates.  Markets’ eyes will be firmly fixed on the ECB’s annual three-day shebang in Sintra and policy meetings in Japan and Britain. It was in Sintra two years ago that Mario Draghi sparked a bond selloff by remarking on the euro zone’s “strengthening and broadening” economic recovery. Sadly, that was a false alarm; two years later Draghi is winding up his term with little sign of growth or inflation and a real likelihood of more rate cuts.   Similarly, the Bank of Japan has watched its 2% inflation target recede into the distance. As the Fed gears up to cut rates, the BOJ may have no choice but to follow suit, possibly as early as September. It could cut rates to minus 0.3% from minus 0.1%, some predict. Bank of England policymakers have been at pains to stress rate hikes are still possible. The problem is that no one believes them: markets are pricing rate cuts by next June.   Upcoming meetings will be mostly about signaling. But they may show if policymakers intend to eventually walk that talk.   (GRAPHIC: Rate Cuts by central banks - tmsnrt.rs/2Igfo8O)  Despite a run of weak data and simmering trade tensions, the jury is out on whether the growth outlook is dire enough to merit immediate central bank action. But markets’ rate-cut fixation means the upcoming data deluge takes on greater significance than usual.  China’s May house price data and Germany’s closely-watched ZEW sentiment index are out Tuesday. Wednesday will bring Japanese export figures and UK inflation and on Thursday, we get  the U.S. Philly Fed business index, British retail sales and an early reading of euro zone consumer confidence for June.  The week ends with a key snapshot of the world’s economic health - the Purchasing Managers’ Indexes (PMI) of business activity. U.S. manufacturing PMIs are still holding above the 50-mark that indicates an economy is growing. A move below is what everyone is watching for.  (GRAPHIC: Time for PMIs: Manufacturing PMI - tmsnrt.rs/2RdT02A)  4/CHINA-HONG KONG (DIS) CONNECT  Perhaps nothing sums up the global zeitgeist better than the recent scenes in Asia’s leading finance hub, Hong Kong, where there were clashes between protesters and police but also it seemed between two visions of the world.  Hong Kongers plan to continue protesting a proposed bill that allows people to be sent to mainland China for trial. Opponents of the bill highlight risks to human rights protections as well as the autonomy of Hong Kong’s legal system, one of its main competitive advantages.   The fear is that retail sales and tourism receipts could drop as seen during the 2014 “Umbrella” protests. But a greater problem would arise if the United States decides Hong Kong is not autonomous enough to justify the special treatment it receives — its current status shields it from import tariffs, visa rules and other curbs that apply to mainland China.   Spiraling cash demand due to the standoff has pushed interbank rates to decade-highs while HK stocks have tumbled. The backwash for Beijing too may be unpleasant — Hong Kong is a useful channel for Chinese trade, IPOs and investment. Some $1 trillion in trade passed through it last year and the Stock Connect program with Hong Kong contributes to turnover on mainland exchanges. Watch those protests.   (GRAPHIC: Hong Kong retail sales, tourism, interbank rates - tmsnrt.rs/2X9rU2d)  Voters in Turkey head back to the polls on June 23 for a re-run of the Istanbul mayoral contest. Authorities scrapped the result of the original March 31 vote. That was lost by President Tayyip Erdogan’s candidate, after his AKP Party said the result was invalid. The ousted mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who represents the main CHP opposition party disagrees, and calls the election a “battle for democracy”.  Indeed, the outcome of the vote will be a good indication of  the future direction of policy in Turkey. A victory for the CHP could bolster calls for reforms to revive the economy, while proving potentially damaging for Erdogan’s authority. But an AKP win could allow Erdogan to tighten his grip on power.  Raising the stakes further is that the election takes place at a testing time — tensions are running high between Ankara and Washington over the purchase of Russian S-400 defense systems. U.S. threats of sanctions have caused a selloff in the lira while risk-insurance costs for Turkey are on the rise.   (GRAPHIC: Turkey 5-yr CDS - tmsnrt.rs/2XKCIAR) 	Reuters

727	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1TF08D	June 14, 2019 /  2:40 AM / 10 months ago	'Hong Kong' searches surge behind China's Great Firewall	BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese censors are working hard to erase or block news of the Hong Kong protests on social media and search platforms amid a surge in interest from mainland internet users.  Reports and images of clashes this week between Hong Kong police and demonstrators protesting against an extradition law with mainland China have circulated world wide.  At the same time, Beijing has been working to keep the news away from people on the mainland or at least filter the content.  “People are very curious, and there is a lot of discussion on this event,” said one person who works as a content censor at Weibo Corp, which operates the Weibo platform.   Tencent Holdings Ltd’s Wechat, the country’s most popular social media app, showed searches for “Hong Kong” peaked at 32.4 million on Wednesday, up from roughly 12 million a week before.   Freeweibo.com, which tracks censored posts on the Weibo platform, said “Hong Kong” was the most searched topic in the past few days.  Other hashtags such as “oppose China extradition” and “go Hong Kong!” were also among the top 10 most-searched topics.  Searches for “Hong Kong” on Baidu, China’s top search engine, more than tripled over the weekend, a sharp rise in interest despite strict rules that bar access to foreign social media and news outlets.  Tests conducted by Reuters on Wednesday showed some mainland Wechat users could not receive images of the Hong Kong protests, including demonstrators amid tear gas. Similar images posted to popular social media sites were removed within minutes.   The censorship, while broadly effective, is not complete.  Some content posted on individual accounts that showed this week’s protests was not immediately removed, though censors say popular images and posts in group chats are quickly flagged.   China’s state media made virtually no mention of the protests until Hong Kong authorities denounced Wednesday’s violence.   The Weibo censor, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said images of Sunday’s protests were not permitted on the platform, but images from official sources were allowed.   On Thursday, searches for “Hong Kong” on Weibo showed only statements from the city’s chief executive condemning the protests. Other items showed photos of pro-Beijing protesters calling for an end to American interference.   Photos of clashes between police and protesters were accompanied by captions that accused “Hong Kong separatists” of organizing attacks on police.  Weibo, Tencent and the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the government body responsible for enforcing censorship guidelines, did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.   Beijing has tightened censorship in a wider “rectification” effort that has ensnared foreign media websites and thousands of domestic news accounts on social media.    “They are afraid it will trigger a chain reaction,” said political commentator Zhang Lifan, noting the sensitivity around the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown and China’s tensions over trade and Taiwan with the United States.  “If the flame of the Hong Kong spreads to the mainland, then it will be very bad for them,” he said.

Protests around the city’s legislature on Wednesday forced the postponement of debate on the extradition bill, which many people in Hong Kong fear will undermine freedoms and confidence in the commercial hub.  Hong Kong’s China-backed Chief Executive Carrie Lam condemned the violence and urged a swift restoration of order but has vowed to press ahead with the legislation despite the reservations about it, including within the business community.  The number of protesters milling about outside the legislature in the financial district fell overnight but rose again through the day on Thursday to about 1,000 at one stage.  They expect the legislature, which has a majority of pro-Beijing members, will try to hold the debate at some stage, though it issued a notice saying there would be no session on Thursday.  “We will be back when, and if, it comes back for discussion again,” said protester Stephen Chan, a 20-year-old university student.   “We just want to preserve our energy now.”    Earlier, some protesters tried to stop police from removing their supplies of face masks and food and scuffles broke out.  Police with helmets and shields blocked overhead walkways and plainclothes officers checked commuters’ identity cards.  A clean-up got underway to remove debris like broken umbrellas, helmets, plastic water bottles and barricades from the streets after the previous day’s clashes. Police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and pepper spray on Wednesday in a series of skirmishes to clear demonstrators from the legislature.  Officials said 72 people were admitted to hospitals.   Hong Kong Police Commissioner Stephen Lo said what began as a peaceful gathering on Wednesday had degenerated into a riot with protesters “acting violently in an organized manner”.  Police arrested 11 people and fired about 150 tear gas canisters at the crowd. The city’s hospital authority said a total of 81 people were injured in the protests. 22 police were injured according to Lo.  Police also later arrested two students at the University of Hong Kong after a raid on a student hall of residence, according to an official at the university. The police gave no immediate response to Reuters inquiries on what charges the students face.   In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the Chinese government “strongly condemns the violent behavior and we support the (Hong Kong) government in dealing with it according to law”.  In the United States, senior congressional lawmakers from both parties responded to the crisis by introducing legislation that would require the U.S. government to provide an annual justification for the continuation of special business and trade privileges afforded to Hong Kong.  “If the extradition bill moves forward and Hong Kong’s autonomy and democratic institutions continue to erode due to interference from the Chinese government, the Congress has no choice but to reassess whether Hong Kong can receive preferential economic and trade benefits under U.S. law,” Democratic Representative Jim McGovern, one of 13 co-sponsors of the proposed legislation, said in a statement.  The U.S. State Department said on Monday it was gravely concerned about the proposed amendments to the extradition laws, warning they could jeopardize Hong Kong’s special status.    Authorities shut government offices in the financial district, which is overlooked by the towers of some of Asia’s biggest firms and hotel chains, for the rest of the week after some of the worst violence in Hong Kong in decades.   Hong Kong’s benchmark stock exchange slid as much as  1.5% on Thursday before closing down 0.1%, extending losses from the previous day.  Most roads in the business district were open on Thursday but some shops and offices were closed and banks, including Standard Chartered, Bank of China and DBS, said they had suspended branch services in the area.    Wednesday saw the third night of violence since a protest on Sunday drew what organizers said was more than a million people for the biggest street demonstration since the 1997 handover of the former British colony back to Chinese rule.  The handover included a deal to preserve special autonomy, but many in Hong Kong accuse China of extensive meddling since then, including obstruction of democratic reforms and interference in local elections.  The extradition bill, which will cover Hong Kong residents and foreign and Chinese nationals living or traveling through the city, has sparked concern it may threaten the rule of law that underpins Hong Kong’s international financial status.   Beijing rejects accusations of meddling and Chinese state media said this week “foreign forces” were trying to damage China by creating chaos over the bill.  The English-language China Daily said the “lawlessness” would hurt Hong Kong, not the proposed amendments to its law.  Lam and her officials say the law is necessary to plug loopholes that allow criminals wanted on the mainland to use the city as a haven. She has said the courts would provide human rights safeguards.  The Civil Human Rights Front, which organized Sunday’s huge march, said it was planning another demonstration for Sunday.  Opponents of the bill, including lawyers and rights groups, say China’s justice system is marked by torture and forced confessions and arbitrary detention.  Democratic city legislators condemned Lam and what they said was heavy-handed police action.  “We are not a haven for criminals, but we have become a haven of violent police. Firing at our children? None of the former chief executives dared to do that,” said legislator Fernando Cheung.  “But ‘mother Carrie Lam’ did it. What kind of mother is she?”  Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan would not accept any extradition requests from Hong Kong under the proposed law. The self-ruled island also issued a travel alert.  Hong Kong’s Tourism Board called off a dragon boat carnival this weekend while the city’s bar association expressed concern over video footage of police using force against largely unarmed protesters.

Tencent Holdings Ltd’s Wechat, the country’s most popular social media app, showed searches for “Hong Kong” peaked at 32.4 million on Wednesday, up from roughly 12 million a week before.  Freeweibo.com, which tracks censored posts on the Weibo platform, said “Hong Kong” was the most searched topic in the past few days.  Other hashtags such as “oppose China extradition” and “go Hong Kong!” were also among the top 10 most-searched topics.  Searches for “Hong Kong” on Baidu, China’s top search engine, more than tripled over the weekend, a sharp rise in interest despite strict rules that bar access to foreign social media and news outlets.  Tests conducted by Reuters on Wednesday showed some mainland Wechat users could not receive images of the Hong Kong protests, including demonstrators amid tear gas. Similar images posted to popular social media sites were removed within minutes.  The censorship, while broadly effective, is not complete.  Some content posted on individual accounts that showed this week’s protests was not immediately removed, though censors say popular images and posts in group chats are quickly flagged.  China’s state media made virtually no mention of the protests until Hong Kong authorities denounced Wednesday’s violence.  The Weibo censor, who declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to the media, said images of Sunday’s protests were not permitted on the platform, but images from official sources were allowed.  On Thursday, searches for “Hong Kong” on Weibo showed only statements from the city’s chief executive condemning the protests. Other items showed photos of pro-Beijing protesters calling for an end to American interference.  Photos of clashes between police and protesters were accompanied by captions that accused “Hong Kong separatists” of organising attacks on police.  Weibo, Tencent and the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the government body responsible for enforcing censorship guidelines, did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.  Beijing has tightened censorship in a wider “rectification” effort that has ensnared foreign media websites and thousands of domestic news accounts on social media.  “They are afraid it will trigger a chain reaction,” said political commentator Zhang Lifan, noting the sensitivity around the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown and China’s tensions over trade and Taiwan with the United States.

Hong Kong riot police and protesters braced for possible further clashes on Thursday after a day of violence over the extradition bill that would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial.  Police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and pepper spray in a series of skirmishes to clear demonstrators from around the city’s legislature. It was some of the worst violence in Hong Kong since Britain handed it back to Chinese rule in 1997.   The Hong Kong Hospital Authority said 72 people had been hospitalized by 10 p.m. on Wednesday.  The English-language China Daily said the new amendments were in line with international conventions but “the opposition camp and its foreign masters seem willing to oppose it for their own purposes at the expense of the city’s rule of law, public safety and justice.”  “It is lawlessness that will hurt Hong Kong, not the proposed amendments to its fugitive law,” it said.  The state-owned tabloid The Global Times blamed “radical opposition forces” and “the Western forces behind them” for hyping up and politicizing the amendments.  “Playing with uncontrolled street politics is to push Hong Kong to backwardness and disturbance,” it said. “This is not a wise direction for Hong Kong.”  Hong Kong has been rocked by three nights of violence since a protest on Sunday drew what organizers said was more than a million people.

Tens of thousands of protesters had gathered peacefully in the Chinese-ruled city to protest against the extradition bill.     But as tempers flared, riot police fired multiple volleys of tear gas at demonstrators who threw plastic bottles in running battles outside the city’s legislature.  Some businesses shut and workers walked out on strike, a rarity in Hong Kong, to support the protest.  The benchmark Hang Seng Index closed 1.7% lower, having lost as much as 2% in afternoon, while Chinese companies in Hong Kong ended down 1.2%.  That compared with losses of less than 0.6% in Shanghai and Asia ex-Japan.  The selloff came amid broader concerns about the global economy due to fears that the Sino-U.S. trade war could be prolonged.  Ben Kwong, director of research at KGI said stocks were due to give up some gains following their strong performance in recent sessions and the clashes on the streets provided the impulse to sell.  “This is a normal initial reaction, when you have social unrest or tension, given that we’ve had a few years of relative calm,” he said.  But it also sent financial institutions scrambling for liquid assets with interbank interest rates in the city shooting up across the curve. One-month and two-month HIBOR reached their highest since late 2008, while the one-week tenor jumped 87 basis points.  A Hong Kong Monetary Authority spokesperson told Reuters “the banking system of Hong Kong is safe and sound. Local banks are well capitalized and highly liquid. Their asset quality is good and their operations are strong.”  Both the Hong Kong dollar currency market and the money markets were operating in an orderly manner, the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.  As a result of the higher interbank rates, the Hong Kong dollar rose as much as 0.2% to its strongest since last December. It was last seen at 7.8250 per U.S. dollar.  The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar at a range of 7.75-7.85. Official interest rates in Hong Kong usually move in lockstep with the Fed.  Interest rates are usually higher and liquidity tight during the mid-year dividend season and when there are large listings in the local stock market.  But two forex analysts based in the city said the protests added pressure, heightening concerns about capital outflows.  “This time around, people are really concerned about political risks, worried about foreign capital leaving Hong Kong,” said one of the analysts, who asked not to be named.  In September 2014, when the 79-day pro-democracy “Occupy” protests erupted, the local currency and stock market weakened initially but rebounded in the following month, while the HIBOR curve sat below 1%.  Back then, however, global growth was strong enough for the Fed to hike rates and move away from interest rates that were near zero percent. This year, markets expect the Fed to cut rates amid concerns over growth and intensifying trade tensions.  The aggregate balance, a gauge of interbank liquidity, stood at HK$54.4 billion ($6.95 billion) on Wednesday, compared with over HK$239 billion in September 2014.  As such, local markets may react differently to the social unrest given the risks of lower rates locally, said Alex Wong, director at Ample Finance in Hong Kong.  “The impact was short lived in the past. But now we’re in bear market. Sentiment was not good before this,” he said.  Fitch affirmed Hong Kong’s AA+ credit rating on Wednesday, citing strong public finances and resilient economy.  But the rating could come under review if there is “a move towards greater alignment of institutional and regulatory frameworks that diminish the autonomy of Hong Kong with respect to the factors that support its higher credit rating relative to mainland China,” the agency said, commenting on the extradition bill.

The protesters, most of them young people dressed in black, erected barricades as they prepared to hunker down for an extended occupation of the area, in scenes reminiscent of pro-democracy “Occupy” protests that gridlocked the former British colony in 2014.  Protesters rallied in and around Lung Wo Road, a main east-west artery near the offices of embattled Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, as hundreds of riot police, some armed with batons and plastic shields, warned them to stop advancing.  “Didn’t we say at the end of the Umbrella movement we would be back?” pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo said, referring to the name often used for the “Occupy” demonstrations.  “Now we are back!” she said as supporters echoed her words.  Others once again called for Lam to step down.  Opposition to the bill on Sunday triggered Hong Kong’s biggest political demonstration since its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “once country, two systems” deal guaranteeing it special autonomy, including freedom of assembly, free press and independent judiciary.  But many accuse China of extensive meddling since then, including obstruction of democratic reforms, interference with local elections and of being behind the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers, starting in 2015, who specialised in works critical of Chinese leaders.  Lam has vowed to press ahead with the legislation despite deep concerns in the Asian financial hub, including among business leaders, that it could undermine those freedoms and investor confidence and erode the city’s competitive advantages.  The government said debate on the bill that was due to take place in the city’s 70-seat Legislative Council on Wednesday would be delayed until further notice.  The legislature is controlled by a pro-Beijing majority.  “We won’t leave till they scrap the law,” said one young man wearing a black mask and gloves.  “Carrie Lam has underestimated us. We won’t let her get away with this,” he said.  (To see a live blog of coverage of the Hong Kong protests, click reut.rs/2Iajtez)  Beijing again reiterated that the “one country, two systems” formula is best for maintaining long-term prosperity and stability.  “The practice of ‘one country, two systems’ in Hong Kong has achieved remarkable success. This is an undeniable objective fact,” Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman An Fengshan told a regular news briefing in Beijing.  Many of the protesters, who skipped work, school or university to join the rally, defied police calls to retreat and passed around provisions, including medical supplies, goggles, water and food.  Some stockpiled bricks broken away from pavements.  Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung urged the protesters to stop occupying the road and appealed for calm and restraint. “We also appeal to the people who are stationed to ... disperse as soon as possible, and not to try to defy/challenge the law,” he said.  The demonstrators rallied just a stone’s throw from the heart of the financial centre where glittering skyscrapers house the offices of some of the world’s biggest companies, including HSBC.  The massive rally was also within sight of the Hong Kong garrison of China’s People’s Liberation Army, whose presence in the city has been one of the most sensitive elements of the 1997 handover.  Standard Chartered, Bank of East Asia and HSBC suspended bank operations at some branches in the area.  A spokesman for bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) said Lam would not attend a cocktail reception on Wednesday as previously planned.  The proposed bill has attracted widespread criticism at home and abroad, prompting rare criticism from judges, Hong Kong’s business community, some pro-establishment figures and several foreign governments and business chambers.  Demonstrators began joining overnight protests earlier on Wednesday as businesses across the city prepared to go on strike.  Lam has sought to soothe public concerns and said her administration was creating additional amendments to the bill, including safeguarding human rights.  Under the proposed law, Hong Kong residents, as well as foreign and Chinese nationals living or travelling through the city, would all be at risk if they are wanted on the mainland.  Sunday’s protest, which organisers said saw more than a million people take to the streets, in addition to a snowballing backlash against the extradition bill, could raise questions about Lam’s ability to govern effectively.  The protests have plunged Hong Kong into political crisis, just as the 2014 demonstrations did, heaping pressure on Lam’s administration and her official backers in Beijing.  The failure of the 2014 protests to wrest concessions on democracy from Beijing, coupled with the prosecutions of at least 100 mostly young protesters, initially discouraged many from going back out on the streets. That changed on Sunday.  The Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong called on the government not to pass the bill “hurriedly” and urged Christians to pray for the city. Lam, who warned against “radical action” at the protests, is a Catholic.  Human rights groups have repeatedly cited the alleged use of torture, arbitrary detentions, forced confessions and problems accessing lawyers in China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party, as reasons why the Hong Kong bill should not proceed.  China denies accusations that it tramples on human rights and official Chinese media said this week “foreign forces” were trying to damage China by creating chaos over the extradition bill. 	Reuters

Tens of thousands of demonstrators stormed main roads next to government office, protesting local officials’ efforts to push ahead with a legislation that would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial.  The benchmark Hang Seng Index gave up 1.6% in the morning session, while Chinese companies in Hong Kong slid 1.1%, compared with losses of less than 0.6% losses in Shanghai and Asia ex-Japan.  The selloff comes amid broader concerns about the global economy, a key driver of growth in the former British colony, as Sino-U.S. trade tensions worsen, and expectations about a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut in the months ahead.  Ben Kwong, director of research at KGI, said local stocks were due to give up some of their gains after a few strong sessions, and that the protest was an excuse for the market to adjust.  “This is a normal initial reaction, when you have social unrest or tension, given that we’ve had a few years of relative calm,” he said.  But it also sent financial institutions scrambling for liquid assets with interbank interest rates in the city shooting up across the curve . One-month and two-month HIBOR reached their highest since late 2008, while the one-week tenor jumped 87 basis points.  As a result of the higher interbank rates, the Hong Kong dollar rose 0.2% to 7.8208 per dollar, its strongest since last December.

Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said she would push ahead with the bill despite deep concerns across vast swaths of the Asian financial hub that on Sunday triggered its biggest political demonstration since its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997.  “When the fugitive extradition bill is passed, Hong Kong will become a ‘useless Hong Kong’,” said Jimmy Sham, convenor of Civil Human Rights Front, the main organiser of Sunday’s demonstration.  “We will be deep in a place where foreign investors are afraid to invest and tourists are afraid to go. Once the ‘Pearl of the Orient’ (it) will become nothing.”  In a rare move, prominent business leaders warned that pushing through the extradition law could undermine investor confidence in Hong Kong and erode its competitive advantages.  The bill, which has generated unusually broad opposition at home and abroad, is due for a second round of debate on Wednesday in the city’s 70-seat Legislative Council. The legislature is controlled by a pro-Beijing majority.  Security was tight around the legislature building, with riot police deployed in some areas. Protesters stood under umbrellas in heavy rain, some singing “Hallelujah”, as police conducted random ID checks.  An online petition has called for 50,000 people to surround the legislature building overnight into Wednesday.  Scores of young passers-by had their bags searched by police and some were detained briefly in a nearby metro station. A police officer on the scene who declined to be named said they were searching for weapons to try to stave off any violence.  The Civil Human Rights Front strongly condemned the searches, saying authorities had made people afraid to participate in peaceful gatherings.  Strikes and transport go-slows were also announced for Wednesday as businesses, students, bus drivers, social workers, teachers, Christian groups and others all vowed to protest, in a last-ditch effort to block the bill.  Britain handed Hong Kong back to China under a “one-country, two-systems” formula, with guarantees that its autonomy and freedoms, including an independent justice system, would be protected.  But many accuse China of extensive meddling, denying democratic reforms, interfering with local elections and of being behind the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers, starting in 2015, who specialised in works critical of Chinese leaders.  Beijing denies those accusations and official Chinese media this week said “foreign forces’ were trying to hurt China by creating chaos over the extradition bill.  Sunday’s protest rally plunged Hong Kong into political crisis, just as months of pro-democracy “Occupy” demonstrations did in 2014, heaping pressure on Lam’s administration and her official backers in Beijing.  Nearly 2,000 mostly small retail shops, including restaurants, grocery, book and coffee shops, have announced plans to strike, according to an online survey, a rare move in the staunchly capitalist economy.  Eaton HK Hotel, which is owned by Langham Hospitality Investments and operated by Great Eagle Holdings , said it respected workers’ “political stances” and would allow them to rally.  Human rights groups have repeatedly cited the alleged use of torture, arbitrary detentions, forced confessions and problems accessing lawyers in China, where the courts are controlled by the Communist Party, as reasons why the Hong Kong bill should not proceed.  China denies accusations that it tramples on human rights. 	Reuters

Riot police surrounded Hong Kong’s parliament early on Monday after what had been a peaceful protest against the bill descended into running clashes between police and protesters.  Hundreds of thousands had jammed Hong Kong’s streets earlier on Sunday to protest against the bill in the biggest demonstration in years. Many said they feared the bill put the city’s vaunted legal independence at risk.  Organisers said there were more than a million protesters, although police put the number at about 240,000.  The China Daily said in an editorial the bill was much-needed legislation.  “Any fair-minded person would deem the amendment bill a legitimate, sensible and reasonable piece of legislation that would strengthen Hong Kong’s rule of law and deliver justice,” it said.  “Unfortunately, some Hong Kong residents have been hoodwinked by the opposition camp and their foreign allies into supporting the anti-extradition campaign.”  Some protesters in the Special Administration Region (SAR)had been misled about the changes proposed in the bill, while others were trying to promote a political agenda, the English-language publication said.  “They have failed to realise that the opposition camp is using them merely as pawns in its manoeuvres to reap political gains by damaging the SAR government’s credibility and reputation, or that some foreign forces are seizing the opportunity to advance their own strategy to hurt China by trying to create havoc in Hong Kong,” the China Daily said.  It did not say who those foreign forces might be.  Foreign governments have expressed concern at the proposed law, warning of the impact on Hong Kong’s reputation as an international financial hub and noting that foreigners wanted in China risked getting ensnared in Hong Kong.  Human rights groups have repeatedly cited the alleged use of torture, arbitrary detentions, forced confessions and problems accessing lawyers in China.  Hong Kong officials have defended the plans, even as they raised the threshold of extraditable offences to crimes carrying penalties of seven years or more.  Another Chinese newspaper, the widely read Global Times tabloid, said on Monday Hong Kong opposition groups and their international supporters were “politically hyping up” normal Hong Kong legislative activity.  The Hong Kong government would not back down, said the paper, which is published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily.  “The Hong Kong SAR government and mainstream public opinion have worked hard for rule of law and righteousness, and will absolutely not give up halfway,” it said in an editorial in its main Chinese-language edition.  The protests were otherwise barely mentioned in mainland China.  A “Hong Kong” keyword search on China’s Twitter-like platform Weibo on Monday showed only posts from verified accounts, mainly government sites and media organisations.  One of the few posts that acknowledged the protests was from the pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Wen Wei Po, which accused “Hong-Kong separatists” of organising people clad in black to rush at police and cause a “clash”.  More specific terms associated with the protests, such as #OpposeChineseExtradition, were censored. 	Reuters

Accountant Ida Lee, one of 1,000 people who gathered in central Sydney, told Reuters she valued her freedom of speech, and that expatriates feared being seized by China as they traveled through Hong Kong.  “Ordinary people like me, I think, will live in perpetual fear of breaking some law in China, and as we’re passing through Hong Kong we’ll be arrested and extradited,” she said.  Hong Kong government officials have repeatedly defended the proposed bill that would allow suspects to be sent to China to face trial, saying the law carries adequate safeguards. But many of its opponents deeply question the fairness and transparency of the Chinese court system and worry about security forces contriving charges.  Australia, with a population of 25 million, has a large Chinese diaspora. More than 500,000 people born in China and more than 86,000 people born in Hong Kong were in Australia as of the 2016 census.  Protest organizer Jared Fu, a university student, called on the Australian government to condemn the proposed law, as the United States, Canada and the European Union had done.  “Our major concerns regarding this bill include possible political persecution and human rights violations and even threats to personal safety if detained by China,” he said.  Australia’s government has not condemned the law but a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson told Reuters on Sunday that its consul-general in Hong Kong had raised the issue with senior levels of the city’s government.    “The Australian government is taking a close interest in the proposed amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance in Hong Kong, including to ascertain any impacts on Australian residents,” the spokesperson said via email.  Fu told the crowd the protest had been organized by volunteers and not by any political organization in either Hong Kong or Australia.  “This is essential to clarify considering China’s government habitually accuses all foreign movements concerning Hong Kong of Western conspiracy,” he said.  “This is not true. We are out here today because we not only care about human rights, we also care about Hong Kong and Australians who may have connections with Hong Kong as well.”  Jacob Cheng, 62, a sales manager who moved from Hong Kong to Sydney in 1989, said Hong Kong residents had to defend their freedom and democracy for the sake of future generations.  “If Hong Kong people are not standing out (to protest) and get the law passed, the woe will pass on to our kids and their kids,” he told Reuters in Cantonese.  Half a million people were expected to brave sweltering heat on Sunday in Hong Kong to press the government to scrap the proposed law. 	Reuters

A committee of pro-democratic groups has raised turnout estimates and are now eyeing the biggest single-day rally since 2003, when a similar number of protesters forced the government to shelve tighter national security laws.  The march will end at the city’s Legislative Council, where debates start on Wednesday into sweeping amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance. The extradition bill is due to be passed by the end of the month.  After weeks of growing local and international pressure, the protest is expected to reflect the broad range of opposition to the bill, with many saying they simply cannot trust China’s court system or its security apparatus.  The city’s independent legal system was guaranteed under laws governing Hong Kong’s return from British to Chinese rule 22 years ago, and is seen by the financial hub’s business and diplomatic communities as its strong remaining asset amid encroachments from Beijing.   Concerns have spread from the city’s democratic and human rights groups to secondary school students, church groups and media lobbies as well as corporate lawyers and pro-establishment business figures, some usually loathe to contradict the government.  (For the most recent stories on the extradition debate, click on. For a story explaining the issues, see)  Veteran Democratic Party lawmaker James To told Reuters that he believed a big turnout on Sunday could finally sway Hong Kong’s embattled government.  “It could really force a severe re-think by the government,” he said.  “There is everything to play for....People really sense this is a turning point for Hong Kong.”  That concern has mounted despite extensive efforts by Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam and her senior officials, both in public and private, to insist that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure that anyone facing political and religious persecution or torture would not be extradited.  Similarly, anyone facing a death penalty would not be extradited, but legislative oversight of extradition arrangements has been removed under the bill.  While the chief executive has to sign off on any extradition, court hearings and appeals must first be exhausted and the government has insisted judges will play a key “gatekeeper” role.  Some senior judges have expressed deep-set fears over the changes, however.  The march will cap an intense political week for the city, with an estimated 180,000 people holding a candle-lit vigil on Tuesday to mark 30 years since the Tiananmen Square crackdown and a rare rally by the city’s lawyers on Thursday.  It follows an earlier protest by more than 100,000 people in late May.  Commercial lawyer and commentator Kevin Yam said he expected many people who attended the recent rallies would turn out on Sunday.  He said it was the first time since the handover that the government had ignored both the concerns of the international community and the local business community at the same time.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his British and German counterparts have spoken against the bill, while 11 European Union envoys met Carrie Lam to formally protest.  On Saturday, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department reiterated U.S. concerns.  “The United States is closely monitoring and concerned by the Hong Kong government’s proposed amendments to the law,” she said. “Continued erosion of the ‘One country, Two systems’ framework puts at risk Hong Kong’s long-established special status in international affairs.”  Influential U.S. Republican Senator Marco Rubio has expressed repeated concern about the bill and a spokeswoman for his office said he was expected to again reintroduce his bipartisan “Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act”, which would update a 1992 law that has afforded Hong Kong trade and economic privileges not enjoyed by mainland China.  The act would require the U.S. secretary of state to certify annually that Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous before enacting any new laws or agreements granting Hong Kong such different treatment. It would also allow the secretary to waive the certification on national security grounds.  Yam said the issue had moved beyond politics at this point. “It is about not doing something stupid,” he said. 	Reuters
