No injuries were reported. A message circulating afterward on the encrypted Telegram messaging app, nearly identical to one that followed Monday morning’s bombing at the Caritas Medical Centre in Cheung Sha Wan, seemed to claim responsibility for the border incident, saying it was “only a start” and demanding the government “close the border in two days”. At a press briefing on Tuesday, superintendent Alick McWhirter of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit said the device, which included a light bulb, cable wire and a circuit board, was designed to be detonated by mobile phone. “The quantity [of explosive material] being such that had this device exploded, it would potentially have caused either death or serious injury,” he said.  Monday night’s attack came to light thanks to a cleaner, who called police at 10.50pm after discovering a toilet ablaze in Kowloon’s King George V Memorial Park. Noticing a strange odour, the cleaner had walked towards the public toilet, where she saw two people run out of a stall for the disabled. No one was injured in the fire, but a toilet seat was seriously damaged.  Officers from the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit arriving at the scene collected two cans and a glass bottle, among other items, as evidence. A police source said the case, which has been classified as arson, was believed to have been the result of an improvised incendiary device.  Earlier on Monday, at 2.30am, a home-made bomb went off in a men’s toilet cubicle at the Caritas Medical Centre in Cheung Sha Wan. While no one was hurt, about 20 patients were evacuated, and service at the hospital was limited until later in the morning. Police have been investigating whether the hospital explosion was linked to anti-government protest violence, according to sources, suspecting the home-made device may have been detonated to pressure the government into closing the city’s borders with the mainland in response to the coronavirus epidemic. A message on Telegram, an app widely used by protesters, said the Cheung Sha Wan attack was “just a warning” and “there will be more real bombs to come”, as closing Hong Kong’s borders was the only way to prevent the coronavirus outbreak from worsening in the city. Organised Crime and Triad Bureau senior superintendent Li Kwai-wah told the press on Tuesday that his department will be handling the case, but no suspects had been identified yet. He said the maximum penalty for people in unlawful possession of these devices was 14 years behind bars. That would increase to 20 years if they put the explosives into use, and a life sentence if injuries were caused. “When the whole city is fighting an epidemic, why are these people still committing such acts? It’s very infuriating really,” Li said. Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu warned two weeks ago of “high risks of home-made bombs” after police uncovered similar cases. 	SCMP

Apparel companies recently told the Post that lists of banned items had expanded to include everything from white tops and colourful hoodies to normal eyeglasses. Post One manager for a Hong Kong-based firm that produces clothing for European luxury brands at a factory in Shenzhen, said single pieces of black fabric and tops featuring metal buckles or buttons had been stopped in recent months. “I ordered a sample of A3-sized black fabric recently for a client in Europe, but the shipment to Hong Kong was stopped without explanation,” said Daisy, who gave a pseudonym to protect her identity. Her company has traditionally used SF Express, one of China’s largest courier companies, to deliver 700 to 1,000 items of clothing each month from their Shenzhen factory to Hong Kong, before then exporting them onwards to Europe. During months of political turmoil, the red line set by mainland Chinese customs’ had varied according to the social situation, she said, with goods consistently subjected to a higher level of scrutiny in the wake of mass protests or incidents related to the anti-government movement.  “On some sensitive days, even white miniskirts were banned. I cannot get the logic of how it’s related to the protests,” she said. Instead of attempting to move bulk orders of black clothing through the delivery giant, Daisy has developed a routine of travelling back and forth from the mainland factory to carry goods back to Hong Kong in small batches. “It’s just like ‘ants moving homes’ as the Chinese saying goes,” she said.  But to avoid having items deemed sensitive confiscated, she has limited herself to three dozen items at a time on cross-border trips. She recalled it once took about 10 days to have black-coloured items returned after they were held up by customs. China bans exports of black clothing to Hong Kong amid protests 17 Oct 2019 China bans exports of black clothing to Hong Kong amid protests 17 Oct 2019   To pile up stock before workers in Shenzhen went on holiday, Daisy mobilised her family members and friends to drive to the mainland a couple of times a day to carry clothing back to the city. “We spent hours on logistics but no time on handling other work at all,” she complained. Another Hong Kong seller, who founded an online sportswear shop in May last year, a month before protests broke out, said his business was crippled by the ban on hooded tops and dark-coloured clothing from a factory in Dongguan, though other items have been affected as well. The seller, who wished to remain anonymous, said he recently placed an order with SF Express to ship a multicoloured windbreaker as a test. The courier’s real-time tracking system showed that the windbreaker arrived in Hong Kong, only to be sent back to the mainland factory the same day, he said. “[SF Express] did not give any explanation for this. I guess it’s because the windbreaker belongs to hooded clothing, which mainland authorities may regard as outfits protesters can wear to prevent them from being identified,” he said. He recalled avoiding confiscation by mainland customs by asking the courier to first ship single black tops from the mainland factory to Taiwan, then arranging for a Taiwan-based courier to ship the goods to Hong Kong. “The delivery took a whole week and cost double,” he said. “But we chose not to abandon the order. We do not want to disappoint our clients.” The founder said mainland authorities had issued an internal notice to the factory in Dongguan, warning that “batches of sensitive items were delivered to Hong Kong by SF Express and other courier companies”. “If similar cases are found, concerned courier companies will face a top level of punishment,” the authorities warned, without specifying the potential penalty. For his online business, it has been a devastating blow. “Unlike sizeable apparel companies, who can ship their clothing in containers to Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam to evade the customs check, we cannot bear the costs of delivering items elsewhere before sending them back to Hong Kong,” he said. How China’s ban of black clothing exports to Hong Kong is hitting one brand 24 Oct 2019 How China’s ban of black clothing exports to Hong Kong is hitting one brand 24 Oct 2019 To get around the restrictions, he abandoned the winter collections in the latter half of last year and invested mainly in summer sportswear with light-coloured clothing without hoods. In addition to the apparel industry, a few eyewear companies have also reported bans on some of their products, months after safety goggles were first stopped from entering Hong Kong. One eyewear designer, whose upmarket glasses are produced in a Guangzhou factory, said he had received two reports that dozens of their glasses had been stopped from entering Hong Kong in November and December, despite having observed proper declaration procedures. “Officers verbally explained to our factory manager that glasses were sensitive, as they belong to the category of goggles,” the designer, who gave his name as Alex to protect his identity, said. He added that the bans appeared to be temporary, as the same products were allowed through customs earlier this month. SF Express, the Chinese courier giant, is popular in Hong Kong thanks to its extensive network of pickup spots and service centres. It is also the official logistics service provider of Taobao, the online shopping platform owned by Alibaba, owner of the South China Morning Post. South China Morning Post The company did not give an official response to the Post about the bans. Post Asked for a list of banned products and reasons for the restrictions, a customer services officer only replied through a messaging app that “deliveries have been normal except items prohibited or supervised under the law and regulations”. Similar bans have also been seen across other players in the courier sector including STO Express, YTO Express and 3speed Express. A notice placed at the top of 3speed Express’s Facebook page said Chinese customs “ramped up inspection of offensive items to Hong Kong” and required them to halt delivery of a list of products that included towels, drones, speakers, horticulture scissors, flashlights and binoculars. Compared with its competitors, Taobao appeared more frank about its reasoning behind prohibiting the delivery of certain items, stating on its official website that items which “might harm China’s politics, economics, culture and morality” are prohibited. It did not provide a list of the items that could be banned. The Post has approached the customs department in Shenzhen for comment. Post 	SCMP

But it is not all one-way traffic. In Taipei, a church, book stores and cafes are lending their support to anti-government protesters 700km away in Hong Kong. One of the movement’s biggest backers in Taiwan is the Chi-Nan Presbyterian Church, which has set up a “Lennon Wall” with a huge banner bearing the words “Safeguard freedom, let’s add oil with Hong Kong”. The congregation has also sent piles of protective gear such as hard hats to demonstrators in Hong Kong – which is in its eighth month of social unrest sparked by the government’s now-withdrawn extradition bill – and supports those protesters who have fled to Taiwan. social unrest extradition bill “It all started with a prayer meeting in June last year, when protests broke out in Hong Kong,” said Kong Chao-ksun, a volunteer at the church.  “After that, many church members wanted to offer a helping hand by sending us materials, hoping we would transfer it to Hong Kong.” Equipment worth about US$530,000 (HK$4.1 million) including gas masks, helmets, air filters, ice packs and alcohol wipes has been gathered by the church. At its peak, it collected 800 helmets in a single week.  Some of that has been distributed by the church itself while the rest has been sent to Hong Kong through different channels.  The church has also offered humanitarian assistance to 200 protesters who have fled to Taiwan, including a couple whose story has touched Kong. Fearing arrest and needing a break from the chaos in Hong Kong, they visited the self-ruled island twice, Kong recalled. “We promised to keep in touch and have dinner with them when they are back in Taipei, but we lost contact with them soon after they returned to Hong Kong,” said the 61-year-old volunteer, who believes they were arrested.  Beijing and Hong Kong protesters react to Tsai Ing-wen’s win in Taiwan presidential election Beijing and Hong Kong protesters react to Tsai Ing-wen’s win in Taiwan presidential election What started as vehement opposition to proposed changes to Hong Kong’s extradition laws in June, has morphed into a wider anti-government movement focused on democratic reforms and police accountability. Hong Kong’s protests have boosted the popularity of Tsai, head of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), who used the unrest as a cautionary tale for the self-ruled island against encroachment from mainland China. She has warned Taiwan’s population of 23 million of being swallowed up by Beijing, which considers the island part of its territory that must one day be brought under its fold, by force if necessary. Tsai netted a historic 8.17 million votes in the January 11 election, comfortably beating her main challenger Han Kuo-yu, from the mainland-friendly Kuomintang (KMT).   Kong agreed that fears Beijing would one day control Taiwan, and turn it into the next Hong Kong, had made Taiwan people feel more connected with Hong Kong protesters. Taiwan went through “white terror” from 1949 to 1987, when martial law was imposed by the government led by the KMT and political dissidents were suppressed. Kong, who has written a book on that era, said he believed Taiwan’s history had made people wary of the situation in Hong Kong. “What is happening in Hong Kong is like what happened in Taiwan during the times of white terror,” he said. “We experienced such kinds of institutional violence 70 years ago.” Kong said Hong Kong protesters who fled to Taiwan found themselves in a similar situation to that faced by dissidents during the white terror, when political persecution prevented many from returning home. Driven by those memories, he revealed the church was considering setting up a foundation or a non-governmental organisation to help Hongkongers, in a move he said would replicate American and European assistance for the island’s white terror victims in the last century. On top of the church’s support, some shops in Taipei are helping people from both cities connect. Philo Cafe in Taipei, co-founded by a few local NGOs, has put up a sign at the entrance saying “Stand with HK”. As a cafe selling books on philosophy, social movement and justice, its owners have hosted seminars and an exhibition on Hong Kong’s anti-government movement, inviting guests from the city. Son Yu-liam, a co-founders of the cafe, is also secretary general of the Taiwan Labour Front, a union founded in 1984. Son said: “Most Taiwan people support the movement in Hong Kong, as we share the same faith: our belief in pursuing freedoms and democracy. “From an advocacy perspective, we also hope that more locals could understand the situation in Hong Kong, as Taiwan has been facing the same pressure from Beijing.” A bookstore called Poetry in Life, which is also in Taipei, has put up donation boxes to raise funds for protesters in Hong Kong. Pro-democracy banners, posters and a Lennon Wall, where messages of support for protesters are posted, can also been seen in the shop. can also been seen in the shop. In the past, Hong Kong was a lighthouse to us as we had no freedoms to publish certain books. But it seems the situation has reversed Liu Gi The shop was founded by Hong Kong poet Luk Wing-yu, whose husband Liu Gi, 40, is Taiwanese and works in the publishing industry. Liu said: “As some Hongkongers know about my shop, they send us products supporting the movement for sale towards charity. “In the past, Hong Kong was a lighthouse to us as we had no freedoms to publish certain books. But it seems the situation has reversed.” He hoped the two jurisdictions could support each other and safeguard freedoms in the face of “threats from China”. Beijing’s top leaders have been wary of closer ties between Hong Kong and Taiwan, fearing connections between what they see as “pro-independence forces”. Son, the unionist, is not shy to admit he is supportive of separatist movements in the area. On election day earlier this month, Son’s bookstore put up banners supporting independence for Hong Kong, Taiwan and even Tibet as he organised a party to witness the vote count and Tsai’s subsequent victory. “It is expected that Beijing will smear us as Taiwan’s independence forces interfering with Hong Kong affairs,” he said. “But I still welcome more Hongkongers to come to this little cafe and brainstorm how we can resist the Chinese Communist Party. “Hongkongers fight on just because Beijing has failed to give them democracy as promised. It is Beijing which has to think about that clearly.” Purchase the China AI Report 2020 brought to you by SCMP Research and enjoy a 20% discount (original price US$400).

Only a few are students,” one source said. As there was no extradition agreement between Hong Kong and Taiwan, he said, there was nothing more police could do. “They have been placed on the list of people wanted by police, and they will face arrest if they return to the city,” he said. Hong Kong has experienced more than seven months of protests sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to jurisdictions with which Hong Kong does not have existing agreements, including Taiwan and mainland China. more than seven months of protests  More than 7,000 people have been arrested since June for various protest-related offences, including rioting, possessing explosives and firearms without a licence, and arson. The sources said police had established that about 220 protesters who feared arrest for their actions had gone to Taiwan.  Of that total, only between 80 and 90 are wanted in connection with alleged acts of violence.  “The rest of the 220 radicals are not wanted by police, because officers have no evidence to show they were involved in violence,” he said. “They learned that some of their friends had been arrested and feared they would be next, so that they chose to escape.” It is understood that among those in Taiwan wanted by police are several suspects who were present during a horrific incident last November, when a 57-year-old man was doused with a flammable solution and set alight along a footbridge in Ma On Shan. More than 20 others in Taiwan have been identified as being among the hundreds who stormed and vandalised the city’s legislature last July 1. Officers collected thousands of pieces of evidence from the trashed Legco complex, but managed to identify only a few dozen radicals. “Police identified them because they left fingerprints in the Legislative Council building,” the source said, adding that most of the protesters present could not be identified, because they wore masks, gloves and helmets. So far, fewer than 20 have been arrested in connection with the storming of Legco. The source said the rest of the radicals in Taiwan wanted by police include those who took the law into their own hands and attacked opponents as well as those who hurled petrol bombs and bricks at police or vandalised shops and MTR stations.

Two home-made bombs were also found on the grounds of a Wan Chai school in December. The sources said the radicals retreated to Taiwan knowing there is no extradition arrangement, and they have been granted extended tourist visas to stay on the self-ruled island. Earlier this month, a 21-year-old student who fled to Taiwan after storming Legco last July said he feared he might have to move to Europe or the United States if president Tsai Ing-wen failed in her re-election bid. After she won, the student told the Post : “Now, I feel relieved and more certain about the future. I hope I can focus on finishing my degree here.” the student told the Post Post Tsai and her Democratic Progressive Party have said repeatedly they will do all they can to help Hong Kong protesters seeking shelter in Taiwan. In December, she said there was no need for Taiwan to institute a refugee law, as existing regulations governing the island’s relations with Hong Kong and Macau were sufficient. 	SCMP

Rounds of tear gas were fired at about 12.45am on Monday on Portland Street in the popular entertainment and shopping hub after police said they came under attack. “A large group of rioters gathering in Portland Street, Mong Kok behaved in a disorderly manner and disturbed public peace,” a police statement said. “Despite repeated warnings by police, the rioters refused to leave, and after midnight, threw hard objects at police officers at the junction of Shantung Street and Portland Street. “In the face of the situation, police officers have deployed tear gas to effect the dispersal of rioters, who are warned to stop all unlawful acts immediately.”  The stand-off continued into the early hours on Monday. Earlier in the evening, tensions flared as protesters blocked roads, prompting riot police to arrive on the scene. Officers raised a black flag warning of the use of tear gas.  The force said passers-by were assaulted as protesters blocked roads, forcing the police’s intervention to clear the streets and unlock traffic jams. “Around 9pm, rioters blocked roads and behaved in a disorderly manner at the junction of Nathan Road and Nelson Street, Mong Kok,” police said in a statement on Sunday evening.  “Some rioters even assaulted three innocent passers-by, taking the law into their own hands. “Police warn all rioters to stop all unlawful acts and will take resolute enforcement actions.” On Saturday, tear gas was fired on the first day of the Lunar New Year, as people gathered to mark the fourth anniversary of the Mong Kok riot of 2016. Riot police presence grew early into the evening on Sunday outside the Langham Place shopping centre on Portland Street. Police had earlier entered the mall, following reports of a disturbance. Just before 10pm, police raised the tear gas warning. Street vendors donned masks but continued to sell fish balls and deep-fried tofu. The scenes were similar to the first night of the Lunar New Year in 2016, which prompted the riots later dubbed the “fishball revolution”. Four years ago on February 8, what started out as a dispute between vendors and crowd control officers rapidly escalated into a full-blown night of vandalism and arson, as a crowd led by pro-independence group Hong Kong Indigenous clashed with police.

About a third have proposed studying the underlying causes of the anti-government protests and the participation of youth in policymaking, the Post has learned. anti-government protests Post Approved projects will receive grants of up to HK$500,000 through the public policy research funding scheme managed by the Policy Innovation and Co-ordination Office (Pico), a strategic research unit that reports directly to city leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor. Pico unveiled the special round of public policy funding last November, inviting researchers from universities, think tanks and non-governmental organisations to submit proposals for in-depth research to help identify the underlying causes and solutions for Hong Kong’s deep-seated problems. It hoped the studies would provide “useful data and input” for an independent review committee proposed by Lam to break the political impasse. Anti-government protests triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill last June are in their eighth month, and have morphed into a wider movement demanding greater democracy and police accountability.  Lam has rejected protesters’ calls for an independent inquiry to look into allegations of police brutality, and instead floated the idea of a review committee to look at the reasons for the crisis. The special research grant attracted an overwhelming response by the deadline for applications in December.  An academic source, who is on the panel vetting the applications, said: “About a third are on the underlying causes of the protests and the participation of youth in policymaking.”  Pico suggested 12 research topics, including the underlying causes of the unrest, the public’s attitude to violence and the calls of “perishing together” with the authorities, the city’s governance and constitutional development, public participation in policymaking process, orientation of youth and school education, impact of social media, public mental health, and communication and conflict among family and friends. New Year’s Eve protests in Hong Kong New Year’s Eve protests in Hong Kong The source said the panel could make its choices by February or March. It is not known how many grants will be given, but successful applicants will be expected to complete their projects within six months.   Pico declined to disclose the number of applications. Political scientists on the selection panel cautioned that the research scheme could not be expected to deliver any quick fixes to the city’s problems. “It is only meant to facilitate discussion, but may not provide solutions,” said Cheung Kwok-wah, from Open University. To find solutions, he said, both sides across the political divide had to be willing to engage in dialogue. “We are in a situation where even when some want to have dialogue, there’s no collective will in society to proceed with the dialogue,” Cheung said. A touchy subject: government accused of stifling debate in city 11 Jan 2020 A touchy subject: government accused of stifling debate in city 11 Jan 2020 City University’s Ray Yep Kin-man said even if the research helped to identify the causes of Hongkongers’ grievances, it could not resolve the city’s political problem. “The studies have to be completed by September, but can we sit on the crisis till September? If we need to wait so many months, we will pay a higher price,” he said. Professor of politics Linda Li Che-lan, also from City University, said while research could provide evidence to improve ongoing and future policymaking, the government should not delay finding a solution to the political crisis. She noted that despite criticism, the government had insisted on setting up an independent review committee rather than a commission of inquiry. “The government should not wait, it should launch the review sooner rather than later,” she said. “But the government cannot shy away from the issue of police operations, or it will not be able to appease the public. It will also be unfair to the police, who are only executing the government's policy.” 	SCMP

The suspects, three men and a woman, aged 25 to 73, were arrested in police raids in Jordan, Kwun Tong and Diamond Hill on Friday. Investigators said the alleged plotters planned to manufacture explosives and intended to “create chaos and injure people” during public assemblies over the new year. Officers in December charged a male school laboratory assistant, an electrical technician, and an unemployed man with allegedly manufacturing a radio-controlled explosive. A housewife and a programmer were among the four arrested on Friday. A gym coach and a retiree were the other two. They were arrested for conspiracy to manufacture explosives and conspiracy to wound with intent.  Officers said they played a supporting role in the group, including instructing members on how to make materials or to provide financial resources. A flare gun, three pistols for firing blanks and a bow were seized at a flat in Jordan, while a samurai sword, an axe and metal balls were found in a Kwun Tong industrial building.  The four are also accused of possessing imitation firearms, possessing ammunition without a licence, and possession of an offensive weapon.

The maximum penalty for those convicted of wounding with intent is life imprisonment, while manufacturing explosives is punishable by 14 years in jail. The three men arrested in December were denied bail by Tuen Mun Court on December 16. Police said they were allegedly testing explosives to be used at mass protests. The bomb could be set off from up to 50 metres away, prosecutors said. 	SCMP

Apart from gathering outside Yuen Long MTR station, which was closed at 3pm, protesters also assembled inside metro stations in Causeway Bay, Chai Wan and Heng Fa Chuen to commemorate the attack on July 21 last year. The incident saw a group of white-clad men armed with metal poles and wooden sticks attack anti-government protesters and commuters inside Yuen Long station, resulting in least 45 being hospitalised. Police were heavily criticised for arriving at the scene 39 minutes after the attack started and failing to make arrests on the night. In response, the force said it was stretched thin by a protest on Hong Kong Island the same night. Railway operator the MTR Corporation shut down Yuen Long station at 3pm. MTR Corporation “To ensure the safety of our passengers and staff, Yuen Long station is closed,” the rail giant said.  It provided a replacement bus service between Yuen Long and Long Ping stations. Police had approved a rally outside Yuen Long station organised by district councillors Johnny Mak Ip-sing and Tommy Cheung Sau-yin for which about 100 people gathered at 7pm. The crowd grew to more than 200 about an hour later. Yuen Long mob attack victims sue Hong Kong police 21 Jan 2020 Yuen Long mob attack victims sue Hong Kong police 21 Jan 2020 Pro-democracy politicians, who have a majority on Yuen Long District Council, this month set up a working group over the attack. District councillor Fong Ho-hin said his camp would continue to press the government and police for answers.  “They have not explained to us how this absurd thing could have happened,” Fong said.  Fellow councillor Kwok Man-ho said some of the attackers identified in news footage and photos had not been arrested.   A Yuen Long resident, who gave his name as Calvin, 36, said he witnessed white-clad men gathering in the area on the night of the attack. Calvin, a hotel worker, said there were fewer arrests than the number of people involved in the attack. “The government wants people to forget about the attack to put an end to this,” he said. After the rally ended at 10pm, a group of police in riot gear dashed into a Light Rail station for unknown reasons. Some district councillors, including Felco Mo Kai-hong, were pepper sprayed at point blank range after officers told them to fall back. Another councillor, Ng Kin-wai, was later arrested. In Causeway Bay MTR station, a group of about 30 staged a sit-in, yelling slogans and singing the protest anthem Glory to Hong Kong. They placed a banner on the floor demanding “the truth”. Glory to Hong Kong   At one point, about 60 onlookers joined in and chanted. “July 21, nowhere to be seen,” they yelled, referring to police. Sports administrator Enrico Ho Chun-wai, 30, said he felt the need to come out because he did not want people to forget about the attack. “People should remember that because of the police’s failure to do their job, people got injured as a result,” he said. ‘Shameless and despicable’: police union slams organiser after rally violence 20 Jan 2020 ‘Shameless and despicable’: police union slams organiser after rally violence 20 Jan 2020 Ho also accused police of being increasingly biased. While people had been held for putting up protest posters, he said, police had not made any further progress in arresting the Yuen Long attackers. Since the attack, 37 people – some allegedly with triad links – have been arrested. Seven were charged with rioting, and police said they were continuing to collect new evidence. Hong Kong’s anti-graft agency, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, also launched an investigation following complaints over the force’s handling of the attack. 	SCMP

As the Lunar New Year is around the corner, our message is online peace and data prosperity,” Wong said. Hong Kong has been embroiled in more than seven months of anti-government protests, triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. The protests have morphed into a wider movement focusing on calls for greater democracy and police accountability. extradition bill Doxxing has been used as a weapon during the social unrest, with people on either side of the anti-government movement disclosing and spreading personal information of not only their opponents but also their family members, often along with intimidating messages. With nearly 5,000 doxxing cases during Hong Kong unrest, new powers mulled 9 Jan 2020 With nearly 5,000 doxxing cases during Hong Kong unrest, new powers mulled 9 Jan 2020 Complaints have shot up from 57 in 2018 to a staggering 4,370 by the end of last year. About 36 per cent or 1,580 cases involved unauthorised disclosure of personal data belonging to police officers and their families, while 20 per cent, or 873 cases, concerned doxxing of protesters. About 30 per cent of the complainants had expressed pro-government views, while 10 per cent, or 434 people, aired anti-government opinions. Four per cent of the complaints were related to government ministers and their family members.  As of January 10, the watchdog referred 1,402 potentially criminal cases to police for further investigation and prosecution. Eight arrests have been made. In addition to the doxxing complaints, the privacy commissioner has received 2,480 complaints over an incident at the Tai Po Mega Mall on December 26. On that day, an officer displayed Stand News reporter Ronson Chan’s identity card in front of a live-streaming camera with 10,000 online viewers during a heated interaction with protesters in the mall. The action prompted a stinging rebuke from the privacy commissioner and a promise to launch a “proactive investigation”. Stand News  Wong revealed he too had been doxxed when a stranger threatened to “celebrate” his birthday with him. “I was left disturbed and perplexed, even though he got the date wrong.” Doxxing: the powerful ‘weapon’ in the Hong Kong protests had a petty beginning 11 Nov 2019 Doxxing: the powerful ‘weapon’ in the Hong Kong protests had a petty beginning 11 Nov 2019 To tackle doxxing, Wong and the government proposed a host of measures, ranging from independent criminal investigatory and prosecutorial powers separate from those of police, to new powers to compel social media platforms to take down doxxed content.  The reform package also included measures to combat data abuse and leakage, after an episode of data hacking of Cathay Pacific rocked the city in 2018. The major security breach led to the theft of the personal information of 9.4 million customers of the airline. The proposals also suggested adding more teeth to the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance by having the power to directly fine wrongdoers a portion of their global earnings and waive the need to issue an enforcement notice first before imposing the penalty. A mandatory data breach notification mechanism for data users to ensure better oversight and law enforcement was also suggested. 	SCMP

Riding on the emergence of the so-called “yellow economy”, Gordon Lam Sui-wa, who is also Hong Kong Food Truck Federation chairman, hopes to win the backing of some 5,000 like-minded food shop operators. Lam announced his ambitious plan at a press conference on Tuesday where, flanked by party leaders and lawmakers, he also revealed he had joined the opposition Civic Party. However, he stopped short of committing to represent the party to contest the seat in the functional constituency of catering in September’s poll. “It is academic to talk about running or not at this stage,” Lam said. “The first thing we would like to do is to encourage like-minded food shop operators to register as voters first. If we can have enough voters, say, 5,000, I will consider running.” Lam described himself as a pragmatic businessman, and believes both the “yellow” and “blue” camps would find him acceptable.  Shops and restaurants are now defined by those colours among anti-government protesters, with yellow businesses deemed to support their cause, and blue ones considered pro-government and police. Lam accused Tommy Cheung Yu-yan, the incumbent catering sector legislator, of failing to speak up for small businesses.  “Many small businesses I came across said their voices are often ignored by Cheung,” Lam said.  Under the Legislative Council Ordinance, a holder of a food business licence, including meat hawkers at a wet market, can register to vote in the catering sector. But many of these small operators do not bother to register. What happens to Hong Kong’s economy when businesses are split into ‘blue’ vs ‘yellow’? What happens to Hong Kong’s economy when businesses are split into ‘blue’ vs ‘yellow’? At present, there are 4,408 voters in the catering functional constituency. In the 2016 general elections, Cheung, party chairman of the pro-business Liberal Party, won 2,438 votes to defeat his rival, chef Ng Wing-tak, who got only 647 votes. Cheung has held the catering seat since 2000. He is also a member of the Executive Council, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s de facto cabinet. “Those in the catering sector should have seen how their representative in the legislature has been doing after the widespread protests in the last several months,” said Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu, the Civic Party leader. “Tommy Cheung also sits on the Executive Council. He should be held partly responsible for the present mayhem Hong Kong is facing.” If Lam says he wants to contribute to the sector, there is no need for him to join the Civic Party though Catering sector legislator Tommy Cheung Cheung declined to respond to the criticism. “Everyone is entitled to their own opinion,” he said. “I have not said that I am going to run again. “No one actually has announced any plans for the elections, as far as I understand. Lam is free to choose to join any party. If Lam says he wants to contribute to the sector, there is no need for him to join the Civic Party though.” There are 70 seats in the city’s legislature. Half of the legislators are returned from geographical constituencies through direct elections. Another half are returned from the mainly trade-based functional constituencies. There are 29 functional constituencies, and different voting systems apply to different functional constituencies. 	SCMP

Ventus Lau Wing-hong, 26, was taken to Eastern Court on Tuesday, two days after the protest in Chater Garden, Central, was cut short. He was charged with one count of inciting others to take part in an unlawful assembly, and one of refusing or wilfully neglecting to obey police officers’ orders. The offences are punishable by a maximum term of five years and one year respectively in prison. Prosecutors alleged that when a community relations officer from the police force, who was identified only as senior inspector 34135, asked Lau to call off the rally, the organiser deliberately asked him to show his warrant card and provoked others to attack him during a subsequent illegal meeting. Protesters punched, spat and threw hard objects at the inspector and injured three other officers after they were incited by the defendant, assistant director of public prosecutions Jonathan Man Tak-ho said. Lau, who called himself a self-employed columnist, was not required to enter a plea as police needed extra time to examine security footage and open source videos, locate witnesses, and take statements from two of the injured officers who were still in hospital.  Despite prosecutors’ objection, Principal Magistrate Bina Chainrai granted Lau bail at HK$10,000 cash plus HK$10,000 surety until his next hearing on April 14, on condition he remain in Hong Kong, avoids Chater Garden, and reports to police twice a week. Lau was among 10 defendants to appear in court after their arrests on Sunday, when protests broke out across the city.

Five of them were students.  Lawyers for 16-year-old Lincoln Chan, who allegedly attacked an unnamed officer in Mong Kok, complained to Kowloon City Court that he was beaten by officers after his arrest.   Eight of the nine defendants were granted bail at HK1,000 to HK$10,000. Chan will remain in custody until he is discharged from hospital. Separately at Eastern Court, an engineer charged over a protest two months ago went free after prosecutors dropped the case against him because of insufficient evidence. The defendant, 24-year-old Leung Chung-yin, was originally charged with possessing three masks, an eye mask, a glove, a roll of adhesive tape and a telescope in Wan Chai on November 11, the day when protesters responded to online calls for a citywide strike and clashed with police in different parts of the city.

The legal challenge was filed half a year after the July 21 attack, in which a group of white-clad men wielding wooden sticks and metal poles indiscriminately went after travellers and protesters, injuring 45. the July 21 attack The attack provoked a public outcry over the police response, with officers accused of colluding with the aggressors by arriving late to the scene and failing to make arrests that night. Democratic Party legislator Lam Cheuk-ting, who was among the injured, announced on Tuesday that he and seven other victims had filed a lawsuit, demanding a total of HK$2.7 million (US$350,000) in compensation. “Our court case is not just for our compensation. We are looking for justice for the victims and for Hong Kong,” Lam said. “This was blatant collusion between the police and triads and marks a watershed for Hong Kong. We’ve been unable to trust the police from that point onwards.” He said he understood the police had received intelligence that an attack could take place at least two days before the incident but did not take precautions, and two officers even left the scene as the attack was happening, without taking any action.  Police have said they were stretched thin that night, as they were forced to deal with a large anti-government protest on Hong Kong Island at the same time. A total of 37 people – some with links to triads – have been arrested for their alleged roles in the Yuen Long attack, seven of whom have been charged with rioting. Police have said they are continuing to collect evidence. Anger and fear at violence in Yuen Long Anger and fear at violence in Yuen Long Lam was unsatisfied that none of those charged was thought to have organised the attack.  After half a year, the scars have not faded for some victims, including a woman who gave her name as Ms Lam.  The 64-year-old burst into tears as she recalled the chaotic scene she witnessed inside the station at about 10.40pm that day. She was travelling home by MTR after participating in the protest on Hong Kong Island. Her legs were injured as she ran from the attackers, and she needed an operation. What wrong did we commit by going home? I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and am taking medication. I just couldn’t sleep at night Ms Lam, Yuen Long attack victim “What wrong did we commit by going home?” she said, still in a wheelchair. “I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and am taking medication. I just couldn’t sleep at night.” Another victim, surnamed So, who is filing a separate suit against police, said he was attacked at about 9pm outside the Yoho mall after he got off from work. “It is ridiculous for the police to blame protesters for the attack,” he said, referring to Senior Superintendent Kong Wing-cheung saying “a group of people had led some protesters to Yuen Long” and that had caused the trouble.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department shut two booths used by the League of Social Democrats at Victoria Park on Tuesday morning, after terminating the group’s licence agreement. This year’s agreement, which the league signed, stipulated that it would only be allowed to sell flowers and food. Selling anything other than that was strictly prohibited, according to the deal. The league was running the stalls mostly to raise funds, to collect signatures for a petition against the police’s use of force against anti-government protesters, and to give flowers to supporters and donors. “We asked the department if there was any way we may cooperate, but they said the licence had already been terminated,” said Avery Ng Man-yuen, the league’s chairman. “Everything in the cordoned area is already government property.” Ng rejected the suggestion his party had breached its licence agreement, and accused the department of suppressing freedom of expression.  “I don’t care whether you are ‘blue’ or ‘yellow’,” he said, using terms for the polarised pro-government and pro-democracy camps. “The most important point is about whether we have a choice, which now the officials are taking away.” Lunar New Year market stalls shut down over Hong Kong protest displays 21 Jan 2020 Lunar New Year market stalls shut down over Hong Kong protest displays 21 Jan 2020 Ng estimated the flowers, displays and banners mocking Xi, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and other government officials cost his party about HK$40,000 (US$1,150).  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department reiterated that under the licence agreement, the licensed area could only be used for allowed products and not for other uses. It said officers already warned the league to rectify it at 11pm on Monday.  Over the past decade, the league has joined other pro-democracy groups, such as the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, in running a stall at the Causeway Bay fair to raise funds and promote their causes. The policy of allowing political campaigning at the fair changed this year amid months of violent civil unrest. All dry goods, including the popular politically themed products, were banned at all government-run Lunar New Year fairs in the city. Officials said the move was an attempt to maintain order and ensure safety. The league was warned on Sunday about its stalls, and the government asked the pro-democracy party to remove the materials by midnight on Monday to “protect the public interest”. The department terminated the agreement after seeing no sign of the league complying with its request. Ng said he would consider launching a civil suit against the department, to reclaim the confiscated property. 	SCMP

Au Nok-hin, 32, is alleged to have caused the injury to Superintendent Ko Chun-pong by using a loudhailer next to him during a stand-off between protesters and police in Yau Ma Tei. The former pro-democracy politician has denied two counts of assault in the incident during the early hours of July 8, in which he is also accused of assaulting Constable Kwan Chi-ho. But Au told Kowloon City Court that he was trying to stop officers from causing a stampede by forcing their way through a crowd of journalists on Nathan Road, the day after an estimated 230,000 people took to the streets of Kowloon in protest against the now-withdrawn extradition bill. The court heard that when officers moved to disperse protesters who gathered on the streets after the rally, they encountered Au and lawmaker Jeremy Tam Man-ho near Dundas Street and Hamilton Street. More than 20 reporters were also gathered at the scene. In a heated altercation, Au allegedly assaulted Kwan by hitting his shield three times using a microphone. Minutes later, he allegedly caused Ko to suffer acute hearing loss in his right ear by speaking through a loudhailer next to him.  Au, who was disqualified last September by the High Court following a successful election petition by his pro-democracy ally Agnes Chow Ting, was the first lawmaker to be charged over the anti-government demonstrations that have rocked Hong Kong since June last year. Prosecutors initially applied to anonymise Kwan and Ko, as AAA and EEE respectively, citing fears of online doxxing and harassment. They later dropped the application as unnecessary. Au’s lawyer, Robert Pang Yiu-hung SC, argued his client had asked officers to stop, as he feared their procession might risk a stampede given the large number of journalists at the scene.  But officers who testified before Magistrate Leung Ka-kie said it was the two officials who caused the confusion and heightened the risk of casualties.  In police footage of the altercation, Au shouted “damn rogue cops” and other curses at officers, as he repeatedly demanded they stop advancing. Kwan, who was standing in front of Au, told the court he felt targeted by Au’s repeated yelling and feared he would resort to more violent means. “I felt scared,” Kwan said. “I didn’t imagine that he, a lawmaker at that time, would have done such things. I was dumbfounded by his reactions.” He reiterated that it was the commanding officer’s order that he march forward, and he also dismissed defence allegations he had bashed the defendant with his shield, before Au retaliated. Senior Inspector Lau Ka-sing, the commanding officer at the scene, said he issued the order after the two lawmakers and dozens of journalists ignored repeated warnings to leave. He said they had sufficient room to step back, but refused to do so. He stressed that while officers were required to respect journalistic rights, the media were not special and should obey the law. “I think police can use appropriate force to disperse them,” Lau said, when prosecutor Vivien Chan Man-wai asked if he thought journalists were obstructing officers. The trial is expected to last three days. 	SCMP

The League of Social Democrats ran two booths – at a cost of around HK$5,000 each – at Victoria Park under new rules imposed this year by the city’s administration, which banned politically themed products in an attempt to maintain public order amid the ongoing anti-government protests. anti-government protests. But on Sunday, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) carried out at least five inspections of the league’s stalls, where material had been posted including a timeline display and political cartoons relating to the unrest sparked in June by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. extradition bill. Warning notices were pinned at the stalls suggesting the league had violated the lease terms at the market, which only allows the selling of flowers and food, while specifically banning dry goods and the publication or promotion of unrelated materials. The department ordered the removal of the material by Monday midnight, “to protect the public interest”. The department ordered the removal of the material by Monday midnight, “to protect the public interest”. Inspectors returned to the stall at about noon on Monday, saying the league had been given enough time to remove the banners and decorations, but had failed to comply. The department then decided to terminate the lease agreement immediately. The department then decided to terminate the lease agreement immediately. “Please keep the stall intact and well maintained and return it to the department by 3pm,” read a termination notice posted at the stand. “The government reserves the right to recover all expenses, losses incurred.” However, no further action had been taken by the department by Monday evening. Hong Kong to allow only flower and food stalls at Lunar New Year fairs 7 Nov 2019 Hong Kong to allow only flower and food stalls at Lunar New Year fairs 7 Nov 2019 The league argued it did not have a chance to rebut the department’s assertions, and asked officials to explain their decision publicly.  Avery Ng Man-yuen, chairman of the league, said the department’s decision to close their booths was “ridiculous”.   “We are a flower booth as well as an exhibition. There should not be any contradictions. I am ready to face any legal consequences.”  Ng said the group’s booths were not violating the lease terms as stated by the department, because they were selling flowers.   He argued the closure was against the freedom of speech, adding: “But we know the contract gives them ultimate power. Let’s wait and let the world see.” Ng added he had been asking officials for an explanation, without success, since Monday morning, before receiving the termination letter. The Post has approached the FEHD for comments. Post Tommy Wong, a university student who came to the market with a friend, said he was surprised that the government would not accept such a display board. “The department is nitpicking from small matters. Maybe they should be less rigid and focus more on how to make the market more interesting,” he said, adding he did not know dry good stalls were banned this year. “I thought it’s so spacious because some stalls are not set up yet. I don’t know the new rules this year.” But Rocky Au, a 40-year-old shopper and his wife, thought it would be better for the LSD to follow the rules. “The government has already said no political materials are allowed, to avoid chaos I guess, and if everyone just tried to ignore the rules, it will be a mess,” he said. Hong Kong protest art goes on sale at independent Lunar New Year fairs 18 Jan 2020 Hong Kong protest art goes on sale at independent Lunar New Year fairs 18 Jan 2020 The market at Victoria Park has been quieter than usual this year. Some areas which used to be packed with dry goods stalls and people were now filled with empty spaces. Some other political associations, such as the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China (the Alliance), the Justice Defence Fund and one pro-democracy business at No 49 also had stalls at the fair selling plants and flowers. The first two said their businesses had not been interrupted, and the FEHD did not object to the Justice Defence Fund putting up a publicity stand with pictures of the nine democracy leaders responsible for the 2014 protest movement. In contrast, the pro-democracy stall incurred a HK$2,000 fine from the Environmental Department on Monday afternoon, after two undercover inspectors found they did not charge a 50 cents plastic bag fee when giving them out. The 15 government-run fairs and festivals around Hong Kong end on Saturday, and this is the first time dry goods stalls have not been allowed at fairs.  The FEHD said earlier the measure was needed for more effective crowd control. 	SCMP

The condemnation by the Junior Police Officers’ Association (JPOA) on Monday came after chaotic scenes erupted at the protest for universal suffrage in Chater Garden, Central the previous day. Two police community relations officers tried to call an early end to the rally, which the force had approved, after outbreaks of violence. But the organiser, Ventus Lau Wing-hong, handed one of them a microphone and told him to make the declaration. Protesters quickly surrounded the police pair and attacked them, leaving them with bloody head wounds. Tear gas and arrests as Hong Kong rally for universal suffrage descends into chaos Tear gas and arrests as Hong Kong rally for universal suffrage descends into chaos As the pair fled with colleagues, they were again surrounded and beaten with sticks and other weapons. Lau said on Sunday night he did not recognise the pair and asked to see their warrant cards, and that it was an operational failure by police to send a few officers into the crowd.  But in a letter to its 28,000 members on Monday, JPOA chairman Lam Chi-wai said: “To one’s surprise, the organiser was doubtful about the identity of the attacked public community relations officers, and incited the sentiment of the protesters. “After the attack on the officers, the spokesman shifted responsibility to police. It is shameless.”  Lam and police said the officers had earlier met Lau to discuss arrangements for the rally and it was not possible he did not recognise them.  “The organiser trashed relations and trust with public community officers and integrity counted for nothing. Such behaviour is despicable,” the letter said. Officers used pepper spray to disperse protesters and several rounds of tear gas were fired. Immediately after speaking to reporters in the evening, Lau, a spokesman for the group Hong Kong Civil Assembly Team, was arrested for obstructing police and violating the conditions laid out in the force’s letter of no objection for the rally. Senior Superintendent Ng Lok-chun told a radio programme that Lau had failed to declare the rally over. However, footage showed Lau had announced the end of the rally at about 4pm and called on protesters to leave peacefully. Separately, police have defended their use of pepper spray after journalists were caught up in the dispersal of anti-government protesters in Mong Kok on Sunday night. Two officers attacked, tear gas fired and organiser arrested in rally chaos 20 Jan 2020 Two officers attacked, tear gas fired and organiser arrested in rally chaos 20 Jan 2020 The force also denied accusations it had displayed a Stand News reporter’s ID card so it could be captured by his live-streaming camera during an earlier rally, insisting the officer was unaware he was being filmed. The Privacy Commissioner is investigating the incident. an earlier rally Chief Superintendent Kwok Ka-chuen, of the police public relations branch, said the journalists affected by pepper spray were among a crowd that included masked individuals, but said he would instruct officers to exercise more caution when deploying the chemical irritant. “Of course, we do not want to misfire at reporters. I will remind officers to be more aware of who is around and to issue more warnings before using pepper spray,” Kwok told RTHK on Monday. Anti-government protesters staged a flash mob protest on Sunday night, blocking roads around Dundas Street, Sai Yeung Choi Street and Soy Street as riot police chased after them. Police appeared to drag a reporter out of a shop where he had been receiving treatment for pepper spray. RTHK, Stand News and HK01 reporters were among those affected by the chemical agent. RTHK, Stand News and HK01 reporters were among those affected by the chemical agent. In a statement, RTHK’s spokeswoman said police had used “unreasonable force” when reporters were cooperating with police orders and moving away. However, Kwok emphasised the pepper spray had been used as part of a dispersal operation against an unlawful assembly, adding people wearing masks and first aid workers were also in the crowd. Similar incidents occurred at previous protests, when police repeatedly advised reporters not to film officers at “zero distance” as such behaviour would obstruct dispersal operations and that masked protesters would use journalists as a cover. In one case, a man mingled with reporters and the crowd and slashed a police officer in the neck. In the past the force has also said persons suspected of “impersonating” reporters engaged in acts inconsistent with the duties of reporters, and even attempted to obstruct police enforcement, participate in illegal and violent acts, snatch suspects from police officers. Hong Kong privacy watchdog to investigate police officer over doxxing allegation 27 Dec 2019 Hong Kong privacy watchdog to investigate police officer over doxxing allegation 27 Dec 2019 Earlier on Sunday, a Stand News reporter covering the Chater Garden rally was stopped and searched twice in nearby Admiralty. In a video capturing the search published on the media organisation’s Facebook page, the officer could be seen holding out the reporter’s identity card to the journalist’s camera, which had been filming live. “Of course, privacy is an important issue to us, but we still need to investigate the details of this case,” Kwok said, adding the journalist could make an official complaint if he was unhappy. The reporter was not wearing a press vest at the time of the incident, Kwok added. Stand News’ Ronson Chan, who appeared on the radio show after Kwok, said his colleague was displaying his press pass and it was clear the officer knew he was being filmed because he could be heard on camera telling the reporter to stop recording. The reporter’s camera phone was later snatched out of his hands and damaged in the process, Stand News reported. Chan, who also had his ID card displayed on a live stream while covering a protest last December in Tai Po, said police treated reporters differently to others when they were stopped. “You will not see police loudly reading out a normal person’s name when they are searching them, but they do that to reporters,” Chan said. The Privacy Commissioner issued a statement saying it would investigate both incidents. The Hong Kong Journalists Association expressed “extreme anger” over the ID card and pepper spray incidents and seriously condemned the force, accusing police of continuously breaking their promise to respect freedom of the press and the right to media coverage.

Authorities are considering giving the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data the power to conduct investigations, launch prosecutions and remove certain social media posts, a move legal experts said could curb the rise of doxxing during the ongoing anti-government protests. anti-government protests With nearly 5,000 doxxing cases during Hong Kong unrest, new powers mulled 9 Jan 2020 With nearly 5,000 doxxing cases during Hong Kong unrest, new powers mulled 9 Jan 2020 On the eve of the release of the annual report by the privacy commissioner on Tuesday, the Post spoke to legal experts on the challenges that lie ahead in tackling the malicious online practice. Post However, lawyers and scholars warned against swinging the pendulum too far and called for safeguards to be put in place to allow fair criticism and scrutiny of public officials.  The proposed shake-up of the city’s privacy laws came as officials revealed the watchdog received more than 4,700 complaints over doxxing since the social unrest began in June. Sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, the more than seven months of demonstrations have since morphed into a wider protest movement, centring on calls for democratic reforms and police accountability. extradition bill Fierce clashes between protesters and police have often broken out in the form of pitched street battles, with petrol bombs thrown and police weapons deployed, but have also come in a war of words, and “weaponised” use of personal information. Social media channel used for doxxing police suspended after court order 17 Dec 2019 Social media channel used for doxxing police suspended after court order 17 Dec 2019 Police have borne the brunt of doxxing, with more than 1,500, or about 36 per cent of all complaint cases, related to the disclosure of personal information of officers and their family members, such as phone numbers, addresses and photos.  About 10 per cent of complaints concerned leaking of private data of those who had made anti-government or anti-police remarks online. The force also came under fire last month when an officer displayed Stand News reporter Ronson Chan’s identification card in front of a live-streaming camera with 10,000 online viewers during a heated interaction. The action prompted a stinging rebuke and a promise by the Privacy Commissioner to launch a “proactive investigation” into the case.  At the moment, the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance sets out two major doxxing offences. Non-compliance with an enforcement order issued by the Privacy Commissioner to rectify misuse of personal data could lead to a maximum fine of HK$50,000, and two years in jail. Lam calls doxxing a threat to society after personal details appear online 22 Dec 2019 Lam calls doxxing a threat to society after personal details appear online 22 Dec 2019 Secondly, the disclosure of private information that causes psychological harm to the victim is an offence punishable by a maximum fine of HK$1 million, and five years behind bars. But the watchdog has long been criticised as a “toothless tiger” for lacking powers to investigate and prosecute offenders. As of January 10, the watchdog had referred 1,402 potentially criminal doxxing cases to the police, which carried out eight arrests last year. The major overhaul to give those powers to the commissioner was broadly welcomed by the legal community. Barrister Craig Choy, who specialises in privacy law, said a distinct law enforcer focusing all its resources and expertise on fighting doxxing would be more effective. “Right now, people have suspicions that the police will not be even-handed between the doxxing cases of police and protesters. So the reform can restore people’s faith in the system, when justice is not only done, but also seen to be done,” Choy said. How Hong Kong protests inspired new Facebook policy on children’s images 5 Dec 2019 How Hong Kong protests inspired new Facebook policy on children’s images 5 Dec 2019 Professor Stuart Hargreaves, a privacy law expert at Chinese University, also welcomed the reforms, but suggested they go further, loosening the legal threshold to “an intent to cause psychological harm or to create fear”, rather than having to show actual psychological harm. Another key plank of the multipronged proposal is to empower the commissioner to take down doxxing content from social media platforms, and require platforms to hand over names and IP addresses of the doxxers. Choy said this should only be done with a court warrant to allow judicial oversight in line with other criminal statutes, and feared a “chilling effect” on online debate. “A public official in the course of the execution of duties should not have a high expectation of privacy, as a photo of him misbehaving or abusing his powers may be conducive to scrutiny and online discussions of public issues,” he said. Hargreaves agreed a delicate balance must be struck. “It would be a problem, for instance, if anti-doxxing laws were used to punish individuals who revealed the information about the secretary of justice’s illegal structures. “But if a law can be tailored so that it only catches genuinely harmful doxxing behaviour, then in principle it is something to support.” The watchdog also proposed a new power to give legal help to doxxing victims to get an interim court injunction to limit harm done to them. Court grants interim injunction to ban doxxing of police officers 26 Oct 2019 Court grants interim injunction to ban doxxing of police officers 26 Oct 2019 Principal lecturer Eric Cheung Tat-ming, from the University of Hong Kong’s faculty of law, said while the civil remedy would need less time to remove doxxing posts and deter reposting than criminal investigations, court injunctions would pose problems too. He cited the recent injunction obtained by the Junior Police Officers’ Association that banned unauthorised disclosure of officers and their family members’ information. “Interim injunctions are applications made by one party that do not involve counterarguments made by defendants,” he said. “They also allow judges to make big legal changes and therefore skip normal scrutiny by lawmakers.” The privacy commissioner, Stephen Wong Kai-yi, said he had told the government in June last year that the ordinance should be reformed to vest “comprehensive criminal investigation and prosecution powers” in him.

Burglary reports increased by 44 per cent from the first 11 months of 2018 to the same period last year, while robberies went up 28 per cent, according to police figures released earlier. Two officers attacked, tear gas fired and organiser arrested in rally chaos 20 Jan 2020 Two officers attacked, tear gas fired and organiser arrested in rally chaos 20 Jan 2020 Most of the cases came after the social unrest broke out in June last year, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. extradition bill Tsang Chung-bun, assistant commander of Yau Tsim district, where burglary reports for the second half of 2019 hit a five-year high, said it was inevitable that protests would take their toll on police resources. “But we need a better patrol plan within stretched manpower,” he said.  “Many districts have been mapping out solutions which include sending crime investigation department (CID) officers to the street, including me. “Officers from the anti-triad unit used to focus on cracking down on gangs but now they have to do everything, including patrol and investigation … plain-clothes CID officers patrol together with beat officers to boost manpower, as officers are prone to attacks.” Burglaries soar nearly 50 per cent as short-handed police battle protesters Burglaries soar nearly 50 per cent as short-handed police battle protesters The superintendent himself has been seen on the streets. He was stationed in Harbour City mall in Tsim Sha Tsui with his undercover team on December 21, when several hundred masked protesters were on the roam.  Tsang said the Yau Tsim district, which covers Yau Ma Tei and Tsim Sha Tsui, was “severely trashed” during months of protests, which he claimed had affected wider crime levels in the area.  Of the 204 burglary cases in the district last year, 151 took place in the third and fourth quarters, with a similar trend for robberies. Explaining the surge, Tsang said Tsim Sha Tsui police stations were subjected to serious attacks in the summer, requiring officers to defend buildings even as manpower was needed for dealing with protesters on the streets. Tsang said some criminals had become emboldened by a wave of criminality that he said could not simply be solved by police and 24-hour patrols, as he cited the “broken windows” theory, which states that a backdrop of crime and antisocial behaviour encourages further offending. “Especially for youngsters, they might think they would have the same luck to get away with crime after seeing other criminals flee successfully. So they could choose to steal … as people ‘do not need to obey rules any more’.” Three flats targeted in HK$850,000 burglary blitz amid Hong Kong protests 6 Dec 2019 Three flats targeted in HK$850,000 burglary blitz amid Hong Kong protests 6 Dec 2019 Tsang also noted that some culprits were very young – a trend he described as “very worrying” – and said he believed many were being exploited by criminals. He admitted officers faced difficulties in cracking cases such as burglaries and robberies because of the widespread destruction of CCTV cameras during protests and increasingly negative attitudes to police making the public less cooperative. Earlier this month, the force tracked down three teens accused of snatching HK$10 million (US$1.3 million) in cash from a mainland Chinese man in Tsim Sha Tsui. The trio, all 16, were suspected – along with another individual – of attacking a jewellery shop employee, 39, on Chatham Road South, near Mody Road.   The youths, believed to have been lured with cash into committing the crime by a mastermind, made off with a suitcase the victim was carrying, containing HK$10 million worth of US, British, European and Canadian currency. made off with a suitcase the victim was carrying, containing HK$10 million worth of US, British, European and Canadian currency. A HK$15 million robbery in November was the largest single crime of its type seen in the district. Three mainland men had their cash-filled suitcase stolen by a group of six wielding a knife and a wooden rod, also in Tsim Sha Tsui. Hong Kong has been gripped by more than seven months of social unrest sparked by opposition to draft legislation that would have allowed the extradition of suspects to mainland China, among other jurisdictions. The protests have developed into a broader anti-government movement with demands including restarting the city’s stalled political reform process. Demonstrations have repeatedly ended in clashes between anti-government protesters and police. Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos Hong Kong police handled 2,056 reports of burglary in the first 11 months of 2019, up from 1,428 in the same period of 2018. About 60 per cent of the cases took place in the second half of the year, following the outbreak of the protests. Robberies also rose to 170 over the same timescale in 2019, from 133 a year earlier. Nearly three-quarters of those crimes last year were committed from June. Members of the public have blamed a lack of patrols for the soaring figures. 	SCMP

When an approved anti-government march turned violent in Causeway Bay, police ordered the rally stopped at 5.30pm, three hours after it began in Victoria Park. turned violent in Causeway Bay Two hours later, after masked radicals vandalised more than five HSBC branches along the route and blocked roads in Wan Chai, officers swung into action on Hennessy Road. They charged at the protesters from two sides, surprising them. More than 460 people were rounded up near the Sogo department store and made to squat with their hands raised or stand, facing the wall. Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos Such swift police action had not been seen in more than seven months of protests in Hong Kong. “It was spectacular,” said Lai, a former police superintendent who helped set up the force’s Counter Terrorism Response Unit in 2009. “The force is now taking a more proactive and determined approach to curb violence, instead of being passive, reserved and defensive.”  The January 1 crowd was estimated at more than a million, and it was the first major rally since Commissioner Chris Tang Ping-keung took command of the 31,000-strong police force on November 19. Senior Superintendent Ng Lok-chun said: “We hoped the rally could continue. But, unfortunately, the mob attacked the same bank again and blocked roads along Luard Road and Hennessy Road in Wan Chai. It was impossible for the rally to go on safely.” He said about 400 people were arrested, mainly for being part of an unlawful assembly, after organisers heeded the police order to end the rally early. Four days later in Sheung Shui, police acted in similar fashion, detaining about 100 people after a rally ended at 3pm. About half of them were arrested. Four days later  Approving of the change in police tactics, Lai said: “It will discourage radical and non-violent protesters from coming out, because they know they will be either arrested or have their personal details recorded by police, making it easier to identify them in future.”  Acknowledging the new strategy, a senior officer with direct knowledge of the force’s operational plans said: “We used to play a drawn-out defensive game when dealing with radical protesters. We even let protesters continue marching in illegal rallies, dispersing them only when massive violence erupted. Now, once violence occurs, we intervene early to cut short the rally, rounding up and detaining people to prevent the situation from worsening. We treat these as battlegrounds and aim to reclaim peace before bedtime Senior police source “Now, once violence occurs, we intervene early to cut short the rally, rounding up and detaining people to prevent the situation from worsening. We treat these as battlegrounds and aim to reclaim peace before bedtime.”   Acting earlier also meant police fired fewer rounds of tear gas and other types of crowd-dispersal weapon, the source added. Some observers say Tang, the new police chief, appears to have changed tactics in dealing with protesters, compared with his predecessor Stephen Lo Wai-chung. Stephen Lo Wai-chung Aside from acting more speedily to curb protest violence and arrest masked radicals, the force has also embarked on a war against anti-police reports in the media – and especially in the Chinese-language newspaper Apple Daily – to protest against what it says is misinformation, and state its view. The protests, now in their eighth month, have led to the arrests of close to 7,000 people, the youngest aged 11. Masked radicals have besieged roads, wrecked traffic lights and set fires on streets, vandalised MTR stations, businesses and banks, and occupied universities. arrests of close to 7,000 people occupied universities   Mobs have attacked police officers at the front line, hurling petrol bombs and bricks, and shooting at them with bows and arrows. Police have responded by firing more than 16,000 rounds of tear gas, 10,000 rounds of rubber bullets, 2,000 beanbag rounds and 19 live rounds. About 1,700 people have been injured, including 550 officers. Since Chris Tang took the helm at the force, officers have started taking a proactive approach to the unrest, moving in swiftly at the first sign of violence.

Senior Chinese public security officials said the central government gave the Hong Kong police force the “strongest backing” and hoped Tang would lead with determination to curb violence in the city as soon as possible, as well as maintaining the morale of his officers. New moves, new risks New moves, new risks In recent weeks, police have taken to placing undercover officers near premises likely to be targeted by masked radicals during protests, such as HSBC and Best Mart 360 branches, to ambush the vandals. HSBC Best Mart 360 On December 21, for example, protesters roaming malls in the tourist district of Tsim Sha Tsui as part of their “Shop with you” rally to scare off shoppers were themselves surprised. On December 21 About two dozen riot officers entered the massive Harbour City mall and teamed up with undercover officers who had been stationed inside all afternoon, as several hundred masked protesters roamed about. There were chaotic scenes, and police used pepper spray as protesters and plain-clothes officers scuffled. “The police presence poses a deterrent effect and shows protesters that we are capable of netting them. They will have to pay a price if they break the law,” the source said. “The same for those who vandalised shops. They thought they could get away with it, but we were all around them.” Security consultant Lai said the new tactics allowed police to nab culprits immediately and draw a line between peaceful protesters, who preferred to stay away from violence, and the radicals. “But these measures also come with a risk,” he said. “It may put less skilful plain-clothes officers in a life-threatening situation if their identity is exposed. Protesters might take the law into their own hands and beat up the officers.” New chief Tang is also battling against anti-police news. Between the time he assumed the top job in November and January 18, police have written 32 letters to the media to rebut what the force sees as fake or biased reports, compared with only six between June and November last year. Hong Kong protest art goes on sale at independent Lunar New Year fairs 18 Jan 2020 Hong Kong protest art goes on sale at independent Lunar New Year fairs 18 Jan 2020 No fewer than 28 letters were sent to Apple Daily, which often features reports of alleged police brutality on its front pages. The senior source said: “As fake information goes viral very quickly and can have damaging consequences, we must respond immediately.” In a letter on January 9, the force rejected an Apple Daily report which said it had continuously violated international guidelines on the use of force. “Your newspaper always accuses police of brutality. We have reiterated that we use only the minimum level of force when necessary,” the letter read. “Over the past seven months, your newspaper has touched on protesters’ violence lightly but has kept smearing the force and inciting hatred against police with an evil intent. We regret your reporting and reserve the right to pursue action.” Speaking in Legco on Thursday, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor denied there had been any police brutality over the past eight months, adding the force should adopt more rigorous enforcement actions as more home-made bombs had been found lately. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam rejects allegations of police brutality against protesters Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam rejects allegations of police brutality against protesters As of December 13, the force’s Complaints Against Police Office had received 1,404 complaints against officers and was investigating. The results must be endorsed by the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC).

June 9 August 31 San Uk Ling Holding Centre The council is due to submit its report to Lam by the end of January, but the watchdog said on Thursday it could not publish the report as scheduled because of an ongoing court case. ‘New tactics divide society more’ ‘New tactics divide society more’ Not everyone in Hong Kong is impressed with the new tactics, or the force’s efforts to safeguard its credibility. Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor director Law Yuk-kai called Tang “a wolf in sheep’s clothing” and more aggressive than his predecessor despite presenting himself as approachable. Accusing police of making “groundless and arbitrary mass detentions” instead of distinguishing between peaceful and violent protesters, he said: “The new police chief has abandoned all guidelines and the tiny bit of prudence the force had. He sugar-coats police brutality and cruel tactics. It is like a girl hiding a knife.” Democratic Party lawmaker Ted Hui Chi-fung agreed that Tang was tougher than the previous chief, and noted that while more protesters were being detained, police were using fewer crowd-dispersal weapons. Democratic Party lawmaker Ted Hui Chi-fung “Yet I don’t appreciate this approach,” he said. “Society needs reconciliation. If you are getting tougher, it only makes society more divided, and people will only hate the police even more.” Police said officers fired 23 rounds of tear gas and 15 rounds of rubber bullets during protests on New Year’s Eve, and seven rounds of tear gas and nine rounds of rubber bullets on January 1. In comparison, close to 3,300 rounds of tear gas and 3,200 rounds of rubber bullets were fired on November 18 when masked radicals occupied Polytechnic University in Hung Hom. Asked if Tang or Lo did a better job, Hui replied: “They cannot be compared, because both are bad.” Police officer among eight arrested next to Tuen Mun ‘Lennon Wall’ 18 Jan 2020 Police officer among eight arrested next to Tuen Mun ‘Lennon Wall’ 18 Jan 2020 Security consultant Lai said police action so far had been far from an “extreme” response to the protests and violence in Hong Kong since last June. “Honestly, police have been very lenient,” he said. “They have a lot of options, in terms of tactics and weapons – way more than you can imagine – but they have only used the tip of the iceberg in terms of what is available to them.” Advising radicals not to underestimate the force’s ability to handle unrest, he said the response so far showed police were hoping to avoid mass casualties. Lam Chi-wai, chairman of the Junior Police Officers’ Association, which represents two-thirds of the force, said Tang attached great importance to communicating with frontline officers and had done much to boost morale. Last year, while Tang was deputy chief, he was seen at protest front lines alongside his officers, dressed in protective gear. Even after becoming commissioner, he was seen on Christmas Eve at high-risk protest spots such as Tsim Sha Tsui and Sha Tin. on Christmas Eve at high-risk protest spots Lam felt it was not fair to compare Tang and Lo, and did not see the new police tactics as resulting from the change at the top. “The force reviews operations from time to time and changes tactics accordingly,” he said. “There is no value in making comparisons. Tang keeps our morale high and we are united.” A second senior police source agreed that comparisons were unfair, pointing out that, as deputy chief, Tang commanded the “Tiderider” operation to deal with the protests. “He was responsible for operations in the past and now. But as police chief now, he can act freely without having to weigh what his boss would think,” the source said. The source added that the situation in Hong Kong had changed too. “In the past, the protesters often outnumbered us, so it was not possible to outflank them,” the source said. “But things have changed. The city has restored a bit of peace and we can adopt other tactics.” 	SCMP

Pillar of Shame The eight-metre-tall sculpture will be erected outside the Danish parliament on January 23. Jens Galschiot’s new work, which depicts torn and twisted bodies to mourn those killed in the Tiananmen Square crackdown, also features faces of Hong Kong’s protesters, with helmets, goggles and gas masks. “Hong Kong citizens have a chance of preserving [their] freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly only if they are backed by us in the West,” Galschiot said in a statement. “I have talked to activists of the pro-democracy movement and I know moral support is crucial to them.” Three Pillar of Shame sculptures are permanently erected in Hong Kong, Acteal in Mexico, and Brasilia in Brazil, “to remind people of a shameful event which must never recur”. The one in the city has been installed at the University of Hong Kong. Pillar of Shame Danish sculptor to attempt Hong Kong visit to repair Pillar of Shame 17 May 2010 Danish sculptor to attempt Hong Kong visit to repair Pillar of Shame 17 May 2010 A ceremony will be held on January 23 to mark the erection of the sculpture, and Hong Kong activists living in Denmark are expected to show up. The sculpture will remain outside the Folketinget, or the Danish parliament, in Copenhagen, for three months. It has been erected in collaboration with a green political party called The Alternative, and Amnesty International’s Denmark branch.   Hong Kong has been rocked by often-violent anti-government protests since June last year sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. The movement has since morphed into a wider campaign against the government – demanding greater democracy and police accountability – with frequent clashes between protesters and officers. Survey of Hong Kong protesters says 80 per cent back ‘one country, two systems’ 17 Jan 2020 Survey of Hong Kong protesters says 80 per cent back ‘one country, two systems’ 17 Jan 2020 There have been more than 1,200 demonstrations, and more than 7,000 people arrested. The government said police would not have used any force on the protesters if they expressed their views in a peaceful manner.  Uffe Elbaek, a leader of The Alternative, said in a statement: “We support this [movement] because the conflict in Hong Kong also tells a story about human rights being under pressure in many places in the world today.”  Trine Christensen, secretary general of Amnesty International, Denmark, said: “It is important for us to show solidarity with the people of Hong Kong who are fighting for the freedom of speech and the right to peaceful assembly.” 	SCMP

Still one of Asia’s busiest airports, HKIA handled 71.53 million travellers in the tumultuous year, 3.2 million down on 2018, according to figures released on Sunday by the Airport Authority. The 4.2 per cent fall is the biggest drop since the global financial crisis caused a 5 per cent decline in 2009. Travellers were still staying away in the final month of the year, when 5.7 million passengers used the airport, some 813,000 fewer than in December 2018. We went through a challenging year in 2019 Vivian Cheung, Airport Authority The year started well for the airport, passenger numbers to July up 1.03 million on the same period of 2018. But that gave way to decline once the protests took hold, sparked by opposition to proposed extradition legislation. Street clashes between protesters and police escalated in violence and spread across the city, even making it all the way to the airport after it was occupied by demonstrators. The unrest still has not ended, and is in its eighth month.  Between August and December, the total number of passengers at HKIA fell by 4.1 million, or 19 per cent, year on year, as the unrest started to deter tourism. The airport’s monthly report highlighted weak visitor traffic to and from mainland China and Southeast Asia in December. However, transit traffic and travel by city residents were up 14 per cent and 9 per cent respectively. Rival groups fight in Hong Kong, on its 15th straight weekend of protests Rival groups fight in Hong Kong, on its 15th straight weekend of protests The annual decline meant that, for the first time, HKIA served fewer passengers in the year than Baiyuan Airport in nearby Guangzhou, where that number grew to 73.3 million, and Shanghai Pudong, where it topped 76.1 million. More than 100 million passed through China’s busiest airport, Beijing Capital.  HKIA was still the world’s busiest airport for cargo, of which it handled 4.8 million tonnes in the year, down 6.1 per cent on 2018, a fall attributed to trade friction and slower economic growth.  “We went through a challenging year in 2019,” Vivian Cheung Kar-fay, executive director of airport operations for HKIA operator the Airport Authority, said. She sought to look to the positives of 2020, which include expanded facilities and upgrades to the passenger experience, including a bridge linking two passenger terminals. Airport traffic slump downplayed as HK$1 billion ‘skybridge’ unveiled 16 Jan 2020 Airport traffic slump downplayed as HK$1 billion ‘skybridge’ unveiled 16 Jan 2020 But Cathay Pacific Airways, which controls about half of HKIA runway slots, warned 2020 was expected to be “highly challenging”. Both Cathay and fellow local carrier Hong Kong Airlines have shrunk their numbers of flights into and out of the city, as have foreign entities including Emirates, Singapore Airlines and United Airlines. More recently, Korean Air and Air China were among those cutting one each of multiple daily flights from Hong Kong, to Seoul and Beijing respectively. Airlines are still waiting for the government to help cut the cost of using HKIA. Last September, a coalition of carriers appealed to the government to help them cope with the downturn in traffic as protests grew. Officials indicated in early December that they would mull cutting airport parking and landing fees. The city’s biggest airline has recovered from several consecutive months of protest-related decline by wooing transit passengers with cheap fares. Cathay Pacific carried 35.34 million customers in 2019, down just 0.7 per cent on 2018. For December, the number was down 3.4 per cent year on year. Visitor arrivals to the city as a whole dropped to 55.9 million in 2019, down 14.2 per cent on the previous year, caused by a sharp decline in mainland Chinese tourists, according to official statistics.

Thousands took part in the police-approved protest in Chater Garden, Central, at 3pm, to demand electoral reforms for September’s legislative elections and urge the international community to impose sanctions on the Hong Kong government if their calls were snubbed. But the day descended into mayhem when police declared the rally over after skirmishes between protesters and officers nearby. Tear gas and arrests as Hong Kong rally for universal suffrage descends into chaos Tear gas and arrests as Hong Kong rally for universal suffrage descends into chaos The first scuffles broke out when police held a man to the ground in Des Voeux Road Central, drawing an angry response from protesters who then surrounded the officers. Eight people were arrested in the area for possession of extendable batons, hammers and spanners. The force said it believed those detained had plans to create chaos.  A group of radical black-clad protesters first set upon a police liaison officer about an hour after the rally started after he spoke to the organiser, Ventus Lau Wing-hong. He fell to the ground as heavy blows rained down on him, including from a protester’s metal baton. A colleague who came to his aid was also beaten. The pair managed to flee across the road but were again attacked as they tried to get into a nearby office tower. “At around 4pm today, while two officers of the police community liaison office were liaising with the organiser of a public event in Chater Garden, Central, they were suddenly surrounded and beaten up brutally by a large group of rioters with wooden sticks and other weapons,” police said in a statement. “They were left with bloody injuries to the head. Such appalling acts are not to be condoned. The police will endeavour to bring the assailants to justice.”  In another statement, the force said protesters threw water bottles at them when they were intercepting people in the area. Six months after attack, many Yuen Long witnesses still have not heard from police 19 Jan 2020 Six months after attack, many Yuen Long witnesses still have not heard from police 19 Jan 2020 Hard-core protesters set up barricades on roads and dug up paving bricks, police said in explanation of their decision to shut down the rally.  Officers used pepper spray on protesters and several rounds of tear gas were fired. A police water cannon and armoured vehicle were moved into Central amid the chaos. But they were not used. Lau, a spokesman for Hong Kong Civil Assembly Team, which organised the rally, was arrested immediately after speaking to reporters in the evening. Police accused him of inciting the crowd and violating one of the rules in the force’s letter of no objection for the rally, that protesters could not overcrowd Chater Garden, Lau’s group said. Zion Lam, another spokesman from the group, denied the accusations and said there was still space in Chater Garden. The organiser had even asked those at the rally to leave to make room for other protesters to get in, Lam added. Before his arrest, Lau said police should bear full responsibility for the day’s chaos. Police officer among eight arrested next to Tuen Mun ‘Lennon Wall’ 18 Jan 2020 Police officer among eight arrested next to Tuen Mun ‘Lennon Wall’ 18 Jan 2020 He said a man in plain clothes who identified himself as an officer asked him to cut short the rally because there were clashes nearby. Lau demanded he show his warrant card. “The officer refused to display his warrant card until the crowd became too emotional. By then, the situation had become too hard to control,” Lau said. “I told him that as long as he showed me his warrant card, I would end the rally.” A large crowd of protesters surrounded the officer, who then showed his warrant card. He and another plain-clothes officer were then beaten up by radicals. Lau claimed that at least 150,000 people took part in the rally, while police put the turnout at 11,680 at its peak. After the rally was brought to an end, police ordered those in the area to leave immediately or be arrested. Some were rounded up. In a police briefing on Sunday night, Senior Superintendent Ng Lok-chun said the two assaulted officers were left with “serious and bloody injuries”. “This happened in broad daylight, right in front of the event organiser himself. We once again strongly condemn rioters for launching such violent attacks on our officers,” he said. He added that the rally organiser was acquainted with the officers, and so it was “ridiculous” that Lau claimed he did not know them. Lau was arrested for contravening the conditions on the police’s letter of no objection and for repeatedly obstructing the officers in carrying out their duties. A total of four officers were injured on Sunday, Ng said. He did not elaborate on the other two officers. Asked why officers held up the identity card of a Stand News reporter in front of his camera while he was doing a live broadcast on Sunday afternoon, Ng said he did not have information on the incident. But Privacy Commissioner Stephen Wong Kai-yi said his office was looking into the incident in a fair manner along with a similar case in Tai Po earlier.

Separately, the force said four petrol bombs were hurled at the reporting room and car park of Tai Po Police Station at about 8pm. No one was hurt but services at the reporting room were suspended. Later on Sunday night, riot police were back on the streets, this time in Mong Kok, a popular shopping and entertainment area in Kowloon. In a game of cat and mouse, protesters tried to block traffic, throwing bags of rubbish and other items close at hand onto roads, as police raced through the streets after them. Police raised a blue flag, warning protesters they were taking part in an illegal assembly, a number of times. Officers also used pepper spray, at one point firing on a group of people, including reporters, gathered on the pavement. Sunday afternoon’s demonstration, the second in a row pushing for more democracy, was held as protests, sparked in June by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, entered their eighth month. extradition bill The movement has morphed into a wider anti-government campaign, with protesters issuing five demands, including the establishment of a judge-led independent inquiry into the police’s use of force. Lau said the government must scrap the functional constituencies of the Legislative Council, which return 35 lawmakers to the 70-seat legislature and have long been criticised. Voting for the functional constituencies, except for five “super seats”, is restricted to those from certain trades and professional sectors.

Lau added: “We’re not just here to protest today. We’re here to revolt, to exact revenge [for government inaction].” Some rally-goers waved US national flags and banners calling for Hong Kong independence. In November, US President Donald Trump signed into law legislation that could bring diplomatic action and economic sanctions against Hong Kong, waving off multiple warnings by China against such a move.

That’s why we hope there will be more interventions from foreign countries,” Kwong said, referring to sanctions from foreign governments. “This is the only way to keep up with the pressure.” Earlier this month, Hong Kong’s education minister Kevin Yeung Yun-hung warned that teachers’ personal remarks on social media were regulated by the law and a professional code of conduct and those who behaved inappropriately should face consequences. Another protester, office worker Andy Chan, joined the rally because he was angry at police’s use of force at previous protests.

Yuen Long MTR station attack The July 21 attack, in which a group of white-clad men armed with wooden sticks and metal poles injured 45 civilians and protesters, quickly provoked an outcry over the police response, with officers accused of colluding with the thugs by arriving late to the scene and failing to make arrests that night. Police, for their part, have said they were stretched thin, as they were forced to deal with large anti-government protests the same night. they were stretched thin A total of 37 people – some with links to triads – have since been arrested for their roles in the attack, seven of whom have been charged with rioting, and police have said they were continuing to collect new evidence.   But the city’s Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Tuesday confirmed in its annual review that they were investigating complaints centred on that night’s policing, although no officers have been found guilty of misconduct at this point. confirmed in its annual review In a reply to the Post, the watchdog said they were following up on the complaints seriously. “Without [the Operations Review Committee’s] discussion and endorsement, the ICAC will not conclude an investigation,” it said. Post  As the Yuen Long attacks approach their half-year anniversary, the Post visited shops and restaurants in a key area near the station, Fung Yau Street North, where some witnesses shared surveillance camera footage with local media in the immediate aftermath of the incident. Post The street, just a five-minute walk from the MTR, is where dozens of white-clad men gathered before the attack, and where pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho Kwan-yiu was filmed shaking hands with the group and thanking them. Junius Ho Kwan-yiu was filmed shaking hands Of the 30 shops and restaurants whose staff spoke to the Post, just two said their employees had been approached by police attempting to gather evidence. Another 15 businesses were either closed or unwilling to talk to media. Post  According to staff at the two stores that did speak to police – a chemist and a shop selling car accessories – their employees were interviewed by police officers in late July, although no request was made for surveillance camera footage.  In footage that the chemist owners provided to local media, dozens of men in white tops can be seen walking along the street at about 8pm on the evening of the attack, while police vehicles were seen passing by the unusual gathering three times without interfering. The attack inside the MTR station started after 10pm. The store owner, who asked not to reveal his name, said he was surprised by the questions raised by the police. Police arrest 10 radical Hong Kong protesters over pipe bomb plot 16 Jan 2020 Police arrest 10 radical Hong Kong protesters over pipe bomb plot 16 Jan 2020 “Officers just asked me briefly about what I saw, but quickly shifted to ask in detail whether ICAC officers came over to conduct investigations,” he said. “I wonder how much effort the police officers have put in finding out who the attackers are.” He and an employee of the car accessory shop, who both witnessed the gathering of white-clad men on July 21, said there were no follow-up visits by police and they were not asked to identify suspects. But a government source said police had already presented evidence to the Department of Justice in several cases and were waiting for approval from the department to press charges. Asked why officers had not collected security camera footage from most shops and restaurants on the street, a police spokesman said the force would “continue to conduct thorough investigations and collect evidence with a view to bringing offenders to justice”. Officers just asked me briefly about what I saw, but quickly shifted to ask in detail whether ICAC officers came over to conduct investigations Yuen Long shop owner The spokesman also said its Complaints Against Police Office was looking into 54 reportable complaints and 20 notifiable complaints it received in relation to the incident. Edwin Cheng Shing-lung, a former member of the Independent Police Complaints Council, said it would have been more reasonable for the police to go shop by shop to ask for verbal evidence and CCTV footage, as would be typical in investigating a robbery. “I am not sure why the police approached only two shops if they were not located in very significant and unique places,” he said. “It would be a more thorough and reasonable approach for the police to ask the shops one by one.” Hong Kong blames protesters for police using force after human rights report 15 Jan 2020 Hong Kong blames protesters for police using force after human rights report 15 Jan 2020 He also said police should double down on their efforts in the investigation. “Half a year is already too long for such a serious case of public concern,” he said. “Society has been relatively calm recently and the police should deploy more manpower in the investigative jobs.” Fear stemming from the indiscriminate attacks still lingered in the community, shop owners told the Post, and businesses had seen profits tumble for months. Post A beef brisket restaurant on the street reported monthly revenues dropping by half. Its owner, who gave only his surname, Hui, said his business managed to survive because his landlord had recently reduced the monthly rent by about HK$3,000 (US$386). “We used to target diners who return late from work.

Meanwhile, the Yuen Long district council, in which 33 of 45 members hail from the pro-democracy camp – which has made the July 21 attacks a consistent talking point – created a task force earlier in the month to look into the incident.

He planned to invite commanders involved in the operation, witnesses, rural villagers and MTR staff to give evidence, with an eye toward releasing an interim report in the first half of this year, and a full report within next year.

They will offer products such as artworks and snacks modelled on icons of the protests which have gripped the city since June – such as Pepe the Frog and the LIHKG Pig– as well as card games mocking political figures. There would have been three more markets, but the government scuppered newly elected pro-democracy district councillors’ plans for events in Sai Ying Pun, Tuen Mun and Kwai Tsing. “It’s a kind of suppression,” Central and Western district councillor Cheung Kai-yin, also one of the organisers, said. She had plans for about 40 stalls selling local handicrafts, fruits and political products such as pro-democracy stickers on Centre Street in Sai Ying Pun this weekend. Cheung said she applied for a licence to hold the event from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department in late November, shortly after the pro-democracy camp made huge gains in local elections, taking control of all but one of the city’s 18 districts. But the department did not give approval and Cheung and her team had to cut down the number of stalls by about half, with mostly game stalls and workshops. She added that no money would change hands. A department spokeswoman said the government found it would not be suitable to hold the proposed event at the site during the suggested time, after consulting relevant departments.  Cheung regretted their decision, asking why she and her team could not set up a market for dry goods when the government would not provide one. While the annual markets are known for their flowers and fruit, some stallholders have traditionally also traded in merchandise for pro-democracy parties and anti-government novelties including, most famously, toilet roll bearing the face of former city leader Leung Chun-ying. toilet roll bearing the face of former city leader Leung Chun-ying Lunar New Year countdown in China as millions head home for holiday 17 Feb 2020 Lunar New Year countdown in China as millions head home for holiday 17 Feb 2020   Soap maker Catherine Lau Chi-wai, who had planned to sell her wares at the Sai Ying Pun market, was disappointed by its cancellation.  “I put a lot of effort into making many things,” the 48-year-old said, adding that she had needed to work within a tight time frame. She said she made 36 bars of soap using pomelo leaf – a plant customarily used for bathing the day before Lunar New Year, to wash away the previous year’s bad luck. Having multiple venues allows us to ‘be water’. If a site doesn’t work out, then we can have other venues to make that up Kwun Tong fair organiser She wanted to donate the proceeds to protesters who face “political repression”. As the market was called off, she said, she would be happy to give her products away for free, in the worst case. The market plans in Tuen Mun and Kwai Tsing were dropped because commercial activities are not allowed at the proposed sites, under Housing Authority policies. A proposal for a market in Whampoa, filed by Kowloon City district councillors, was denied like the Sai Ying Pun plan, but some stall owners managed to move their business to a nearby seafood place. Preparing to launch a market in Kwun Tong from Thursday, Henry Law, 22, admitted securing venues was challenging for organisers. But he and his team managed to find about 10 businesses to lend them space for free, including a gym and a restaurant, so they could run bazaars scattered around different corners in the district, over an area totalling 20,000 sq ft. “Having multiple venues allows us to ‘be water’. If a site doesn’t work out, then we can have other venues to make that up,” he said. “Be water, my friend”, the famous saying of the late martial arts star Bruce Lee, has become a strategy in the social movement, under which protesters seek to be spontaneous, formless and flexible. Zero Lee Yui-hang, 30, who runs a board game centre on Shing Yip Street, Kwun Tong, said sharing his almost 1,000 sq ft space for the two-day market would mean forgoing more than HK$10,000 income. Shanghai’s Chinese New Year carnival in 1946 Shanghai’s Chinese New Year carnival in 1946 “Money is important, but there is something more important,” the protest supporter said. Retailer Jake Li, 26, said it was a relief to see independent festive markets take root, having been caught off guard by the removal of dry goods from government fairs. Li recalled he and his business partners had initially planned to sell card games based on the city’s political or protest figures, as well as tram models, at the government-run fair in Causeway Bay’s Victoria Park, and had already invested HK$100,000 before the officials’ announcement. He said they struggled to find a factory to mass-produce the products, especially because their political content would put off mainland Chinese manufacturers. They had to resort to a factory in Taiwan, upping their costs. On Saturday, at his stall at the unofficial Causeway Bay fair, Li said he had sold 80 sets of the cards since setting up the previous day. He previously said he had more than 100 online pre-orders. “Our greatest hope is to give back to the ‘yellow economic circle’ when we secure a certain sum of income,” he said. The “yellow economy” refers to businesses which openly support the social movement, and to which protesters are increasingly looking to give their custom. Some of the non-official festive markets are specifically in support of the yellow economy. Peter Shiu Ka-fai, who represents the retail sector in the legislature and sits with the pro-establishment camp, said Hong Kong is a free society and businesses can make their own choices, but noted that companies do not normally look to narrow their customer base.

A 28-year-old advertising worker, who gave his name as Quincy, had spent about HK$500 on medical face masks and envelopes that said “Hongkongers, add oil”, a colloquial Cantonese expression of encouragement. He said he preferred the independent markets to the traditional ones, as he could browse online to see if there were interesting products before deciding to go. He added: “I think these markets can replace the traditional ones.” Despite the ban, Cheung, and a group of Central and Western district councillors, set up “street booths” with civilians on Centre Street on Saturday afternoon. The attractions, including local crafts and music performances, drew hundreds of people.

Paul Chan Mo-po also voiced caution in the face of public calls for cash handouts on Saturday, stressing that the government had to consider the financial burden given the estimated budget deficit. Chan dropped the hint after a forum organised by the city’s public broadcaster RTHK on his upcoming budget, attended by around 100 citizens. Chan said he had to find resources to fund the 10 new welfare measures announced by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor on Tuesday, with accommodation likely to be made in the city’s budget to be delivered next month. “Year after year, we have rolled out one-off relief measures, be it salaries and profit tax rebate, rates rebate, or other expenditure items,” he said. “The total amount ranges from HK$20 billion to more than HK$60 billion, which is quite substantial.” “Some of these may perhaps be adjusted to accommodate the funding requirements of some additional measures as recently announced by the chief executive,” he said. HK$10 billion welfare package signals a shift in Hong Kong government’s priority 17 Jan 2020 HK$10 billion welfare package signals a shift in Hong Kong government’s priority 17 Jan 2020 The 10 measures include lowering the age threshold for using public transport for just HK$2 per ride from 65 to 60, and giving out housing subsidies to people who have waited for a public flat for more than three years.  These will increase the government’s recurrent expenditure by two per cent. Chan said the recurrent expenditure had increased significantly over the past decades. Citing that the figure was HK$150 billion in 1997/1998 and HK$200 billion in 2007/2008, he said it had increased to about HK$400 billion in the last two financial years. It rose by HK$40 billion in 2019/2020.  The government estimated earlier that the city would face a HK$80 billion budget deficit. HK$80 billion budget deficit  Warning of diminishing government revenues – particularly from land sales – in the coming years, Chan said the government would study the possibility of widening the tax base. In the forum, some people said they wished for a cash handout. A young man even urged Chan to give out HK$10,000 to every citizen. But Chan, in a measured tone, said different views had been received. “People may get angry if the handout is too little … We have to consider that very carefully, taking into account the fiscal burden.” Some also voiced their dissatisfaction over the government’s handling of the civil unrest which is now in its eighth month. civil unrest Hong Kong has been roiled by civil unrest since June last year sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill.

On calls for setting up an independent inquiry panel to probe police’s use of force on protesters, Chan resoundingly said “no”. Meanwhile, Secretary for Transport and Housing Frank Chan Fan denied that the government penalised young people by excluding non-elderly singles while giving out cash allowances to public rental unit applicants who had been waiting for more than three years. “Considerations are usually given to families and elderly people who are single. Younger applicants who are single are usually assessed by a points-based system,” Chan told a radio programme on Saturday. “The latest measure follows this direction.” Chan also said that a study on tenancy control of subdivided flats, which would be carried out by the government, would take around one year.

Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said setting up the panel, which was intended to focus on security and constitutional affairs, went beyond the powers of Tai Po District Council. On Wednesday, a district officer for Tai Po and a group of her colleagues walked out during a council meeting as members set about choosing a chairman and vice-chairman for the new committee. The walkout, and a similar incident in another district, triggered controversy and one complaint to the Ombudsman, with some accusing the officials of displaying political partiality by leaving. Cheung told a radio programme on Saturday: “The district officer sought legal advice, which clearly stated that the work of the committee deviated from the District Councils Ordinance. It’s ultra vires, which means beyond one’s power ... it could be illegal.” He said that was why the officials could not stay in the meeting, telling reporters after the programme that officials would not join any of the committee’s future meetings. “Relevant government officials will not attend, this is very clear,” he said, adding that district staff were unlikely to provide the usual secretarial services, “if the formation of the committee does not have a legal basis”.  According to the ordinance Cheung cited, the city’s 18 district councils, each of which has an officer who serves as a link to the city government, are there to advise on local community matters and focus on livelihood issues. Cheung added that they should not be platforms for political expression. A day after the Tai Po walkout, a similar incident happened at a Central and Western District Council meeting.

The government later issued a statement to say it disagreed with the motion, which it said “made unfounded allegations against police”.

Democratic Party lawmaker Ted Hui Chi-fung, 37, will likely be endorsed to defend his Hong Kong Island seat, party vice-chairman Lo Kin-hei said on Friday. “I believe the public can see his level of involvement in the recent social movement,” Lo said, referring to the ongoing anti-government protests which are now in their eighth month. Hui has been seen often in recent months at protest sites, intervening between protesters and police. During a protest on New Year’s Day, he was pepper-sprayed at close range by an officer who twice removed the lawmaker’s googles and asked him to retreat from a road to the pavement. After early successes in the 2011 district council election and 2016 Legco polls, the politician’s career appeared to be in tatters in 2018 after he took a phone away from senior executive officer Christina Leung Ngok-sze outside a Legco meeting.  She was one of the officers marshalling lawmakers into the meeting over a controversial government bill, and Hui felt it was wrong for the government to monitor lawmakers’ whereabouts. He snatched Leung’s phone and dashed into a men’s toilet, where he accessed the contents and forwarded five files to his own email account.  He was subsequently convicted of three charges of common assault, obtaining access to a computer with dishonest intent and obstructing a public officer. He was sentenced to 240 hours of community service and fined HK$3,800. Who is Ted Hui? arrested lawmaker blogs about parenting 6 May 2018 Who is Ted Hui? arrested lawmaker blogs about parenting 6 May 2018 As a result of the case, the Democratic Party froze his membership and launched an internal disciplinary hearing. Former chairwoman Emily Lau Wai-hing called for Hui’s resignation as a lawmaker and party member.  Party chairman Wu Chi-wai confirmed this week that Hui had kept his membership after the disciplinary process. “Hui already received the appropriate punishment,” Wu said, adding Hui had also been condemned internally within the party. “It is up to voters to decide if he should continue his political work.” According to the party, Hui has put his name into the hat for consideration as the candidate for the Hong Kong Island seat and, so far, he is the only member to have done so. On Friday, Hui said he was confident about being endorsed to run, and added he had learned from the incident. “The phone incident was part of the resistance within Legco,” Hui said. “But there were times when I made poor political judgments.” Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing camp reeling after crushing defeat in district council elections Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing camp reeling after crushing defeat in district council elections In last November’s district council elections, Hui contested the Chung Wan seat in Central and Western district, and won comfortably, defeating the pro-establishment camp’s Wong Chung-wai. Political commentator Chung Kim-wah believes the phone-snatching incident would not hurt Hui if he runs again for the Legco. “Compared to the protests that have lasted more than half a year, I believe it was just a minor event,” he said. The Democratic Party has seven lawmakers, and there could be internal competition its Legco seat in Kowloon West, as incumbent lawmaker Helena Wong Pik-wan, 60, and Sham Shui Po district councillor Ramon Yuen Hoi-man, 33, have both put their names up for selection. Chung said it was not unusual for Wong to want to seek re-election, as she was only in her second term as a lawmaker. He said the party will have to consider whether Yuen is an appropriate successor and also weigh his level of recognition among voters. 	SCMP

Huang, 32, was released on Friday, about two weeks before the Lunar New Year – traditionally an occasion for family unions. “She is healthy and still in good spirits. Her activities are restricted now and she is under heavy surveillance,” said a source close to Huang who wished to remain anonymous. “But police are keeping her passport, computer and mobile phone.” In a message sent to friends after her release, Huang wrote that it would not be convenient for her to meet with them now. #MeToo: Speaking out against sexual harassment in China #MeToo: Speaking out against sexual harassment in China “One second of darkness does not make people blind,” she wrote. Huang became a leading figure in the Chinese #MeToo movement in recent years. In 2017, the former state media journalist conducted a pioneering nationwide survey of workplace harassment in the news industry and was a vocal advocate for victims.  She was detained last October on the charge of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”, a vague offence that is often used by mainland authorities to silence dissidents and rights activists. Huang was initially held at Baiyun District Detention Centre in Guangzhou before being placed under “residential surveillance” in an unknown location.  In the months leading to her arrest, Huang had published two essays reporting her observations of the summer protests in Hong Kong. She was about to start a law degree at Hong Kong University when her passport was confiscated in August by mainland authorities, preventing her from leaving the mainland.

The unrest initially was tied to an extradition bill that would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to jurisdictions with which Hong Kong does not have a treaty, including mainland China.  The proposed legislation has since been withdrawn and the protests have evolved into an anti-government movement.

The 31-year-old constable from Castle Peak Police Station, who recently joined an anti-riot squad, was part of a group approached by police officers in Tuen Mun shortly before 3am. He is the first member of the force to have been detained on suspicion of being involved in activities relating to the anti-government protests sweeping the city. According to police, five men and three women aged 14 to 61 were arrested on suspicion of possessing anything with intent to destroy or damage property. Posters, an electric drill, a scraper and gloves were found on two of the suspects.   A police source said the officer had been suspended from duty. “The force attaches high importance to the integrity of police officers,” a spokesman said. “For any force member who commits illegal acts, the force will handle this seriously.”  The group was arrested on Lung Mun Road near Tuen Tsing Lane, where they were suspected of building a “Lennon Wall” on roadside railings.

Among the eight publicly funded universities in Hong Kong, the University of Science and Technology (HKUST) said last month that exchange students would not be joining in the coming semester. On Friday, Polytechnic, Baptist, and Education universities confirmed they had taken similar action. Baptist and Polytechnic universities started the second term this week after suffering damage to campus facilities last year when protesters occupied the campus. Police officer among eight arrested next to Tuen Mun ‘Lennon Wall’ 18 Jan 2020 Police officer among eight arrested next to Tuen Mun ‘Lennon Wall’ 18 Jan 2020 The remaining four, the University of Hong Kong (HKU), as well as the City, Lingnan and Chinese universities, made it clear their incoming exchange programmes would go on, even as HKU and CityU warned of a decline in the number of inbound exchange students. Outgoing student exchange programmes at the eight universities remain unaffected.  Hong Kong’s universities, many of which are among the world’s top 100, have been popular destinations for exchange students around the world, especially those who wanted to experience the mix of Eastern and Western cultures in the city. But amid the violent protests, especially at CUHK and PolyU, scores of mainland and foreign students have left and returned home. Staff and students believe the universities’ decisions were understandable, even though there were concerns whether the halt on receiving incoming exchange students could affect the university’s global rankings in the long-term, as one of the many rating indicators include the proportion of inbound and outbound exchange students.  Baptist University said its programme had been temporarily suspended after discussions with partner institutions “considering the impact of the events in recent months on exchange students”.  A Baptist University spokeswoman added: “The university will continue to monitor social conditions, maintain close liaison with partner institutions, and make relevant arrangements for exchange students again when it is deemed appropriate.” Inside the occupied Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus Inside the occupied Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus Spokeswomen for Education University and PolyU confirmed the suspension of their exchange programmes for a semester. Students and teaching staff were divided over the cancellation of exchange programmes. Aidana Turlybekova, a 20-year-old PolyU Year Two student from Kazakhstan, said her family had expressed worries over the situation in Hong Kong, so she understood the reason to cancel exchange programmes, but felt it was a pity as the university was still generally safe. “We really get to know new [exchange students] every semester, but maybe it’s the right thing to do for now, only for one semester,” she said. Occupy ringleader Shiu Ka-chun relieved of teaching post by Baptist University 18 Jan 2020 Occupy ringleader Shiu Ka-chun relieved of teaching post by Baptist University 18 Jan 2020 But a Year Four student and student representative on PolyU’s governing council Owan Li worried that the suspension of exchange programmes could impact the university’s rankings. “The decision is not ideal because one of the major factors of the universities’ global rankings is internationalisation, which would be negatively impacted by the drop of exchange students,” he said. Chinese and local organisations help students from mainland China flee universities in Hong Kong Chinese and local organisations help students from mainland China flee universities in Hong Kong According to the latest edition of the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings, CityU, PolyU, and Baptist University, ranked 19th, 25th and 58th respectively in Asia after jumping a few places, but HKU, HKUST, and Chinese University, each slipped one place, to third, eighth and 10th in Asia. As many as 40 countries and jurisdiction had issued travel warnings or alerts for Hong Kong during the protests, which first erupted in June triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. China wants more students ‘to serve country’s strategic demands’ 17 Feb 2020 China wants more students ‘to serve country’s strategic demands’ 17 Feb 2020 Baptist University senior lecturer Bruce Lui Ping-kuen expected if the exchange programmes were only suspended for the current semester, the impact on rankings could be limited. But he said it was unnecessary to cancel all inbound exchange programmes in the second term. “I believe from the university’s perspective, they might be concerned about exchange students’ safety, but I think there is no need for schools to be overly sensitive since the situation [in Hong Kong] has calmed down recently,” Lui said. Meanwhile, CityU and HKU, which have not suspended their programmes, predicted incoming exchange students would be affected. A spokeswoman for HKU, which takes in more than 1,200 incoming exchange students each year, told the Post they expect to see a “significant drop in the overall number of inbound students on exchange” for the second semester.

Secretary for the Environment Wong Kam-sing revealed the decision during a Facebook live chat session on Friday, in which the minister took questions from the public about a range of issues including recycling, the city’s climate change strategy, and a long-delayed waste charging scheme. “Now that the situation is relatively calm, we have asked our contractors to resume collection in safe areas such as housing estates and at government community green stations,” Wong said. “Throughout the social unrest, many glass recycling bins were damaged. If the bins filled with glass were poured out into public spaces, it would have posed a danger to both residents and protesters.” Glass bottles, mainly for beer and other alcoholic drinks, were used by protesters to make petrol bombs to throw at police. The unrest was triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, but later morphed into a wider anti-government movement. Rubbish and recycling bins have been regularly used to block roads during the more than seven months of protests.  Wong added the government was working to ensure there were enough uses for recycled glass, such as in eco-pavements and construction. Over the past two to three years, its efforts had improved the recycling rate for glass bottles from one out of every 10 bottles, to three out of 10, and Wong urged residents to continue to recycle glass. Edwin Lau Che-feng, executive director of The Green Earth, hoped the government could speed up the resumption of glass collection. The group has previously criticised the glass recycling ban, and said it would have caused tonnes of bottles to be dumped in landfills.  “Taking away the collection bins was never going to stop people who wanted to use glass bottles for any illegal activities in the first place. People could just go to any back alley behind a bar and collect the bottles there,” Lau said.   The removal of the bins would have just deterred residents’ will to recycle glass, while at the same time businesses that had already trained employees to separate glass from other waste would have to relearn how to handle glass without recycling services, he said.  Wong’s live chat session, which he promoted on Facebook as “conversation is better than opposition”, has since been viewed almost 5,000 times. While Wong mostly took questions related to environmental policies, many commenters demanded to know how tear gas, which has been heavily used by police to disperse protesters, had affected the environment. Others simply commented, “five demands, not one less”, the main rallying cry of the protest movement. Only the first demand, the withdrawal of the extradition bill, has been met. Protesters have also called for universal suffrage in the city, and an inquiry into police use of force. “While Wong is a relatively low profile in terms of politics, it would be difficult to shift people’s focus away from what they consider the most pressing matters, namely police brutality and the government’s inaction throughout the protests,” said Chung Kim-wah, assistant professor at Polytechnic University’s department of applied social sciences. When will Hongkongers stop treating recycling like it’s someone else’s problem? 20 Nov 2018 When will Hongkongers stop treating recycling like it’s someone else’s problem? 20 Nov 2018 Meanwhile, Wong also urged legislators to pass a long-delayed bill on municipal waste charging, which was submitted to the Legislative Council in 2018. The process has been stalled in the legislature and two bills committee meetings last year had to be cancelled because of the unrest. Results from a public engagement project on the city’s long-term decarbonisation plan were also expected by the first half of this year, and Wong said he would use the data to improve the city’s climate change strategy. He also defended the Environmental Protection Department’s suggestion on Thursday to limit the use of commercial diesel vehicles to 15 years, which many commenters said was an unreasonably short time. The government had previously provided subsidies to diesel vehicle owners to switch from the less efficient pre-Euro IV type diesel engines to the cleaner versions. About 80,000 diesel vehicles had already been phased out under the existing policies, which led to a significant improvement in roadside air quality and Wong hoped people could understand the importance of phasing out diesel cars. “I think we need to balance the fight against climate change and roadside pollution with the time limit on diesel cars,” Wong said.

In a statement issued on Thursday night following a closed-door meeting, the IPCC said its governing council “unanimously resolved at the meeting to postpone the decision on the publication of the interim report … until after the delivery of judgment in the judicial review.” The interim report, endorsed earlier that day, specifically looks into clashes between protesters and police on June 9 and 12, and July 1. It remains unclear when the full review, covering the dates from July onwards, will be completed.  The decision to hold back the report dealt a blow to Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s pledge that the review would be published by late January or early February. Lam, in refusing protesters’ demand for a judge-led independent inquiry, had said the IPCC inquiry was appropriate and that another “review committee” would be set up to look at the broader, underlying causes of the past seven months of social unrest. Eric Cheung Tat-ming, another former member of the IPCC, questioned the timing of the IPCC’s decision to delay the report’s release.  “The High Court granted leave for application for the judicial review nearly a month ago. The IPCC should have stopped its review if it realised there could be problems when the judicial review was given the go-ahead,”said Cheung, who is principal law lecturer at the University of Hong Kong. The IPCC should have stopped its review if it realised there could be problems when the judicial review was given the go-ahead Eric Cheung, former IPCC member “But the IPCC didn’t stop its work since then and continue to compile its report.”  Cheung noted that the court had not issued an injunction against the report’s publication, adding that making it public ahead of the court decision would have no consequences that could not be undone. “It’s obvious the decision was not made purely on legal grounds,” he said. Democratic Party lawmaker James To Kun-sun echoed that interpretation, saying the IPCC had come under political pressure to halt the publication of the report. But former Hong Kong Bar Association chairman and adviser in Lam’s de facto cabinet Ronny Tong said the IPCC’s decision to postpone the report’s publication was justified. “The court granted application for the judicial review last month,” he said. Though he agreed “the IPCC had responded to the development too slowly.” The legal challenge, brought by social worker and activist Hendrick Lui Chi-hang, centred on the council’s authority to initiate such a review. He has argued that the government should not use the IPCC probe as a pretext to refuse to launch an independent inquiry into clashes between police and protesters. Presiding judge Mr Justice Keith Yeung Kar-hung ruled on December 20 that Lui’s challenge was “reasonably arguable”and could proceed. No date has been fixed yet for the judicial review hearing yet, a legal source said. IPCC vice-chairman Tony Tse Wai-tsuen said on Friday it was a shame that the interim report could not be published according to the planned schedule. “But we also need to respect the court and the statutory power of judicial review,” Tse said. “We understand there is a public expectation. We hope the court hearings can start as soon as possible.” Lui, meanwhile, said he would not withdraw his judicial review. “It wouldn’t change the fact that the IPCC had gone beyond its statutory power even if I drop the case,” he said. The Hong Kong Economic Journal, citing unnamed sources, on Monday reported that the council’s interim report found police displayed multiple “shortcomings”, including a lack of communication between commanders, and no clear guidance on when to stop using force.

Democratic Party legislator Ted Hui Chi-fung filed a case at the High Court on Friday, saying while law and order was important, the maintenance of public health deserved a higher priority. “We have received a lot of complaints from local residents [on the after effects of tear gas],” Hui, who is also a member of the Central and Western District Council, said. He added public fear of the harmful effects of tear gas ranged from its potential carcinogenicity to possible adverse effects on pregnant women. “Though there is a need for police to enforce law and order, their use of weapons and force are not totally limited,” he said, adding that police’s power should be reasonable and transparent. Police and health officials have repeatedly refused to reveal the chemical components of tear gas, citing security and operational reasons. Hong Kong has been rocked by anti-government protests since June last year triggered by opposition to the now-withdrawn extradition bill. The movement has morphed into a wider campaign against the government and police, with often-violent clashes between protesters and officers. Put away the tear gas, police urged, as residents claim public health risk 1 Dec 2019 Put away the tear gas, police urged, as residents claim public health risk 1 Dec 2019 Since June, police have fired more than 16,000 rounds of tear gas, 10,000 rubber bullets, 2,000 beanbag rounds and 19 live rounds, in response to radicals who hurled petrol bombs, bricks, and other projectiles at officers and vandalised properties of the government and those linked to mainland China.  Police earlier explained they had no option but to use the crowd-control weapon in the face of violence by radical protesters. In October, a team of local medical experts, led by Chinese University professor Emily Chan Ying-Yang, warned in leading medical journal The Lancet that deployment of tear gas in subtropical environments such as that of Hong Kong could expose people to high concentrations of chemical irritants over a prolonged period. The Lancet   Hui has applied for a court order to compel the defendant – the commissioner of police – to list all the ingredients of tear gas the force has been using since June.  He said the action might be the start of a longer fight. If the components were found to be harmful, he said, he might seek an injunction to prevent police from using it further.

The Court of First Instance has scheduled a session on February 12 to deal with procedural matters. In November, a frontline reporter, who frequently covered protests that were tear-gassed by police, said he was diagnosed with chloracne – a skin condition linked to exposure to dioxins. But health secretary Chan said the health department and the Poison Information Centre under the Hospital Authority found no literature on, or scientific evidence for, any case of dioxin-poisoning caused by tear gas.

The joint survey by Chinese University and the Hong Kong Association of the Heads of Secondary Schools also found that a majority of educators believed the existing curriculum was still highly oriented towards academic pursuits and could not benefit low achievers. The results were released on Thursday, ahead of a government task force’s final report, expected to be published early this year, on a review of the school curriculum. The task force released a consultation document last June, which suggested more flexible learning in subjects including the controversial liberal studies, which pro-establishment bodies said had been behind students joining the ongoing anti-government protests which have gripped Hong Kong since last June. anti-government protests The survey collected responses from 183 principals and 1,158 teachers from 213 secondary schools last September. Nearly 90 per cent of respondents agreed the future secondary school curriculum should improve students’ skills in acting autonomously and taking responsibility, while more than 85 per cent said pupils should learn more about reconciling tensions and dilemmas.  In light of the unrest, different bodies had suggested the schools sector should focus more on educating students about values, patriotic education and the handling of conflicts but the association said the survey did not have much to do with the protests. Education Bureau slammed for allowing private schools to charge millions in fees 14 Jan 2020 Education Bureau slammed for allowing private schools to charge millions in fees 14 Jan 2020 “There are conflicts happening around the world. How young people can learn to face conflicts and value disagreement while getting along with others peacefully is not something unique to Hong Kong but also applies to youngsters in other parts of the world,” said Lee Suet-ying, convenor of the association’s curriculum review and development task force. The ability to act autonomously, take responsibility, and to reconcile tensions and dilemmas were named as key competencies under a conceptual learning framework proposed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).  Professor Esther Ho Sui-chu, director of Chinese University’s Hong Kong Centre for International Student Assessment, said the survey results showed that most educators agreed with the OECD’s framework. More than 80 per cent of respondents agreed the future curriculum should strengthen values and life education, while over 75 per cent believed the current secondary curriculum had been mainly driven by admission to university and could not implement multi-pathway provisions to students.  Lee said that since the current curriculum was exam-oriented, schools had a lack of time to focus on values education and experiential learning. “All of the students’ and teachers’ time is used for preparing for examinations and all sorts of examinations skills,” she added.

Both Chinese University and the association said exams should be more flexible and tertiary institutions able to admit students who had skills besides academic achievement. They said the curriculum should be reviewed regularly so educators could provide feedback to the government. 	SCMP

The study also showed 45 per cent of protesters believed vandalising shops they disliked was acceptable because, “they only caused damage, but did not loot the places or steal money”. “Our study seems to suggest that the rise of Hong Kong independence is only an overblown topic, exaggerated by the pro-Beijing camp, which, unfortunately, could have affected the central government’s policy on Hong Kong,” said Tik Chi-yuen, the party’s chairman. In telephone and face-to-face interviews, the party spoke to 120 protesters who had taken part in demonstrations since the unrest began in June, with 24 having been arrested. While protesters are often labelled anti-China, the study found that 48 per cent “highly support” the “one country, two systems” governing principal, with another 30 per cent said they “fairly supported” the policy. A small minority opposed the policy, under which Hong Kong is given a high degree of autonomy and political freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.  Of those surveyed, 77 per cent believed independence was impractical, while only 6 per cent supported the idea. “Our observation is that most of the protesters are discontent with the social inequality that they view has been brought about by the influx of mainlanders, like under the one-way permit system,” said the report. Nearly a fifth of Hong Kong voters say they support violent actions by protesters 21 Dec 2019 Nearly a fifth of Hong Kong voters say they support violent actions by protesters 21 Dec 2019 The one-way permit scheme allows as many as 150 mainlanders to come to settle in Hong Kong every day.  Originally a think tank, Third Side was launched as a political party in 2016, advocating a moderate and middle-of-the-road approach to social and political issues.  Tik said it was too simplistic for the government to attribute the unrest to the fact many young people “cannot afford to own their own flats”. He called on the city’s leader, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, to take bold action to break the impasse before it was too late. Lam has been reluctant to set up an independent commission of inquiry to look into the police’s handling of protests. As an alternative, Tik has said a panel, chaired by an adviser from Lam’s cabinet, the Executive Council, should be set up. The panel, which would be made up of members of the Independent Police Complaints Council, would be tasked with holding public hearings into the protests, he added. 	SCMP

Even as he refused to back down, Commissioner of Police Chris Tang Ping-keung conceded the force could have handled the social unrest better during a two-hour grilling by predominantly pro-democracy Central and Western District Council members at a meeting to discuss the force’s conduct over the past months since the anti-government protests began last June. So far, 7,019 people have been arrested during the movement sparked by an aborted extradition bill, with 1,092 prosecutions brought to the courts, including 547 cases of rioting. Asked whether the police had made mistakes in handling the protesters, Tang said: “Of course there is room for improvement … including in terms of our actions and strategies, communication with the media, our gear and my colleagues’ attitudes when talking to citizens.” Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam rejects allegations of police brutality against protesters Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam rejects allegations of police brutality against protesters During the rowdy session in which police supporters exchanged angry words with the councillors, the elected officials displayed photos and videos of protesters’ bloodied faces. Venting their anger, they accused Tang of blindly protecting his men as no officers had been punished despite demonstrators’ claims they were assaulted during dispersal actions.   Hui also asked whether Tang would apologise to the public for what he and other councillors called “police violence”. Tang replied: “It is the rioters who should apologise for the harm they have done to society.” He added that any officers found to have committed crimes would be dealt with in accordance with the law.  On a recent poll that revealed 40 per cent of Hongkongers gave the force a satisfaction score of zero, Tang admitted public perception was “relatively bad” and worsening, but said it was partly because citizens were being misled by fake news.  He rejected a call from councillor Ho Chi-wang to resign, saying he was in the right and that the people urging him to quit were just afraid of his righteousness. He categorically rejected remarks from councillors that there was “police brutality” in the city, telling those who claimed they have been mistreated by the force to formally file a complaint to the police’s complaints division. Councillor Camille Yam Ka-yi told Tang that, after a recent demonstration, she saw that police had arrested a group of protesters in Central and tried to get close to assist the detained. But the officers responded by calling her a “cockroach” and shone a bright light in her eyes, she said. Tang said it was inappropriate for officers to use such language. Police have long referred to the protesters as cockroaches, with the other side often referring to members of the force as dogs. It is the rioters who should apologise for the harm they have done to society Chris Tang, police chief The meeting was packed with police supporters, some of whom called journalists present “rogue reporters” and one suggesting they should be assaulted. Council member Napo Wong Weng-chi waved a piece of raw pork at Tang, invoking a Chinese saying to accuse police of falsely arresting protesters. On Wednesday, the Post reported that police were looking to arm officers with weapons that stun suspects or entangle them in nets. Post Hong Kong protests: pepper spray fired during 'shopping’ rally near border with mainland China Hong Kong protests: pepper spray fired during 'shopping’ rally near border with mainland China Asked about this after the meeting, Tang said only that the force had been exploring different types of weapons to enhance operations efficiency. “One of the key issues is about the safety of the weapon. The purpose of exploring new types of weapons is to find alternatives to genuine firearms so that in appropriate cases we can use a less-lethal weapon,” he said. On the teenage girl who claimed she was gang-raped inside Tsuen Wan police station in September last year, Tang said police had looked through CCTV footage and found no such evidence. The force is looking into whether the complainant had given a false statement to mislead police officers, Tang said. Immediately after the meeting, the council passed an impromptu motion in support of the establishment of an independent judge-led inquiry into the social unrest, as well as to condemn Tang for condoning “police violence”. Tang and other officers walked out of the conference room while council chairwoman Cheng Lai-king was reading out the motion. On Thursday evening, the government issued a statement to say it disagreed with the motion. “The motion made unfounded allegations against police. The government disagrees with the impromptu practice of the council as well as the stance of the motion, and therefore all members of the government in attendance walked out of the meeting,” it said.

Although HKIA has made huge investments, notably on a HK$144 billion (US$18.46 billion) third runway, the Hong Kong Airport Authority’s executive director for engineering and technology Ricky Leung Wing-kee on Thursday shrugged off the downturn in passenger traffic. Leung, in his first day on the job, was speaking as the airport showed off its new HK$1 billion “skybridge” to link two terminal buildings – an upgrade that has been two years in the making. “The fluctuation in short-term passenger numbers does not affect investment in long-term infrastructure,” Leung told a media briefing. The bridge will connect the main terminal building and the north satellite concourse. Photo; Shutterstock The bridge will connect the main terminal building and the north satellite concourse. Photo; Shutterstock But he was not able to say whether discounts on airfield charges would be offered to help airlines ride out the fall in passenger volumes as travellers avoid a city which has been rocked by more than seven months of anti-government protests. The airport will unveil its annual figures on Sunday and is expected to show a drop of about 2.5 million passengers year on year. The airport handled 74.7 million travellers in 2018 and 5 million tonnes of cargo. United Airlines plans US$90 million write-down against Hong Kong routes 8 Jan 2020 United Airlines plans US$90 million write-down against Hong Kong routes 8 Jan 2020 The skybridge is part of a wider HK$9 billion expansion and upgrade of the airport’s infrastructure and facilities, some of which have already materialised, including a refurbished and expanded dining hall.  The rush is on to finish work in time for the bridge to be open to travellers by the summer, potentially as early as June. The 200-metre long and 28-metre high structure was wheeled into place last week and will connect the main terminal one building with the north satellite concourse, which currently can only be reached by bus. Overall, 5 million passengers a year will benefit from a smoother experience by not having to take the bus between the two buildings, saving them about 10 minutes. About 110 planes use the concourse each day and over the 12 months, 100,000 bus trips are expected to be eliminated, meaning fewer vehicles darting around the airfield and more efficient operations.  A restaurant, observation deck, and glass panel flooring allowing travellers to look at planes passing underneath will be the main showpieces of the skybridge.  Once completed, the bridge will be the largest and tallest in the world at an airport, taking over from ones at London Gatwick and Kuala Lumpur. Planes as large as the Airbus A380 – the world’s largest passenger airliner – will be able to pass underneath. Weighing 5,000 tonnes, the bridge was built in three sections in Zhongshan in Guangdong province to prevent disruptions at the 24-hour airport and then transported by sea to the site. Protests see travellers avoiding Hong Kong in record numbers 16 Dec 2019 Protests see travellers avoiding Hong Kong in record numbers 16 Dec 2019 The third runway and a new passenger terminal building are also being built, and expected to be ready by the end of 2024. A sprawling commercial development, known as the SkyCity Project, is also in the works and the mix of retail and entertainment space will gradually pop up over several years. The airport has also been directly affected by the anti-government unrest, which broke out last June, with protesters occupying the departure and arrivals halls in August, preventing travellers from getting to their flights. Strict security measures have since been put in place to allow only ticketed passengers to enter the terminal buildings. 	SCMP

The Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) revealed the news to its governing council members during a private meeting on Thursday, dealing a blow to city leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s previous pledge that the review would be published by late January or early February. The first phase of what was called a “fact-finding” exercise has looked into clashes between anti-government protesters and police on June 9 and 12, and July 1. It remains unclear when the entire review, covering the dates from July onwards, would be completed. But the High Court granted a judicial review application on December 20 that would examine if the police watchdog had gone beyond its statutory power to investigate the unrest triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. granted a judicial review application A source said that until legal proceedings had been resolved “the report just cannot be published”.   And, in a statement on Thursday night, the IPCC said the governing council “unanimously resolved at the meeting to postpone the decision on the publication of the interim report. until after the delivery of judgment in the judicial review.”  It also pledged to “use all efforts necessary” to seek an early ruling, but did not spell out whether it would formally make an application to the court. The challenge, brought by social worker and activist Hendrick Lui Chi-hang, centred on the council’s authority to initiate such a review. Presiding judge Mr Justice Keith Yeung Kar-hung at the time ruled Lui’s challenge “reasonably arguable”, and said the legal challenge could proceed.  No date has been fixed yet for the judicial review hearing yet, a legal source said.  But, even if the IPCC applied to the courts to speed up proceedings, one source close to the watchdog said the report, which was endorsed during Thursday’s meeting, was not expected to be published before March. Local newspaper Hong Kong Economic Journal reported on Monday that the council had found police had multiple “shortcomings”, including lack of communication between commanders, and no clear guidance on when to stop using force. Hong Kong Economic Journal The review has been caught in a series of controversies, after a panel of international policing experts announced in December they would “stand aside” from the review. Convened by the council, the five-member panel dropped the bombshell a month after it proposed the watchdog be given the power to conduct a full investigation into officers’ conduct in the handling of the increasingly violent civil unrest.

Returning for the first time, shoppers at Festival Walk in Kowloon Tong browsed in similar numbers to those before the mall was forced to shut on November 13, according to shop workers. But behind the veneer of normality, damaged glass panels had been replaced by white metal fences, while some customers were forced to take detours to get to their destination with more than a dozen escalators still out of action. A handful of shops, including Japanese lifestyle chain Muji, sportswear chain Gigasports, Nike and Toys 'R' Us, were still closed, though normal service was resumed at most boutiques and restaurants.

A giant Christmas tree went up in flames after it was hit with a petrol bomb. The anti-government protests, triggered by the government’s extradition bill in June, have since morphed into wider unrest including some of the most violent disturbances the city has seen.  Festival Walk has been closed since the day it was battered by clashes, though its office tower reopened on November 26. An 83-year-old retiree, who gave his surname Wong, said he wanted to return on the first day because he generally used the mall a lot, owing to its proximity to Kowloon Tong station and its spacious interior.

Of the mall’s 63 escalators, 13 remained out of order, but every floor still had at least one connecting to the storey above.  The two exits facing Tat Chee Avenue and the one leading to the East Rail line were narrowed to only one set of doors, with other doors blocked by white metal sheets. Mainland Chinese postgraduate student Tang Minmin, 23, struggled to get to City University across the road because the tunnel connecting the campus was still blocked. The Hubei native, who moved to Shenzhen, the mainland city bordering Hong Kong, when her university called off the last term, said the mall’s reopening was a sign of society “taking a turn for the better”. But she was frustrated that access to her university from the mall remained blocked. Local resident Edith Tang, 25, was puzzled as to why the mall had not been completely fixed up, despite being closed for more than two months. The skating rink, a signature facility of the mall, was far from ready to return to business on Thursday, with ponds of water gathered on its surface. If you are here to shop, you don’t actually pay much attention to white fences Housewife Iris Li “Putting up white fences doesn’t actually take that much time,” Tang said, adding that the closure had deprived her of restaurants and shops. She had been making dinner at home and doing her grocery shopping at another supermarket instead. But housewife Iris Li disagreed, saying: “If you are here to shop, you don’t actually pay much attention to white fences.” The 50-year-old Hung Hom resident, who had taken the East Rail line to the mall to pick up a dress after a store’s Whampoa branch ran out of her size, said it seemed people were in the mood to shop. A salesman at Japanese fashion chain Uniqlo said customer numbers were smaller than usual, suggesting that many might not have known the mall had reopened. “But it’s good to return to the same environment,” he said. A saleswoman from a children’s fashion store said the crowd was about the same as before, with many flocking to restaurants and food courts on Thursday. By lunchtime, the food court on the second floor was full. Simply Life, a cafe owned by the Maxim’s Group, unpopular among protesters due to several pro-Beijing comments made by its founder’s daughter, had customers lining up outside. Tourists were also in the mix. A Shenzhen woman, who gave her surname Zhang, said she had been going to other districts, such as Tsim Sha Tsui, to shop when the mall was closed. “The reopening is good because this place is kind of a one-stop shop,” she said.

Last month, police froze about HK$70 million in the account and arrested four people on suspicion of money laundering. The arrestees, aged 17 to 50, were later released on bail. The move sparked the ire of protesters, with radicals vandalising multiple outlets of the bank. Some of them also set fire to the lion sculptures outside the bank’s local headquarters in Central.

The chief executive said attacking Beijing’s governing principle, which gives the city a high degree of autonomy, put its liberal economic model at risk in the long run. The agreement between Britain and China for the 1997 handover guaranteed the retention of Hong Kong’s legal, financial and political systems for 50 years. Amid months of anti-government protests triggered by the administration’s now-withdrawn extradition bill, Lam issued a stark warning to young Hongkongers to cherish one country, two systems. anti-government protests extradition bill Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam rejects allegations of police brutality against protesters Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam rejects allegations of police brutality against protesters In her first question and answer session of the year at the Legislative Council, Lam said: “I want to tell the young people, who were mostly born after the handover, to treasure one country, two systems … instead of bringing damage to this important system due to misunderstanding. “Otherwise, they will be creating the situation that they are in fact worried about today.”  She added that the principle ensured the city’s younger generation grew up, and were educated, in a stable and prosperous environment. Lam was responding to a question by pro-establishment lawmaker Ann Chiang Lai-wan, who said the city’s youth were anxious about their future beyond 2047. Under Article 5 of the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution, Beijing promised that Hong Kong’s capitalist way of life would remain unchanged for 50 years after it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  “After 2047, would it become ‘one country, one system’? How would you convince young people that it will still be one country, two systems by then?” Chiang asked.  Lam said full understanding and implementation of the principle would give “sufficient ground” for people to believe that Beijing’s existing policy would extend beyond 2047. “We must defend the foundation of ‘one country’ and respect the differences between ‘two systems’. Only with that can one country, two systems progress forward,” Lam said. What does ‘one country, two systems’ mean? What does ‘one country, two systems’ mean? “If everyone treasured one country, two systems, I don’t see that worry [of whether it would continue beyond 2047].” In her opening speech, Lam said the political crisis had brought “shocking” levels of violence and destruction to the city. “Numerous inaccurate reports and fake information circulated online has seriously damaged Hong Kong’s international reputation for peace, rationality, safety and lawfulness,” Lam said. The chief executive also said she was worried about businesses closing and employees being fired after the Lunar New Year holiday, but said she believed the economy could recover if social order returned.

During Lam’s speech, pan-democrats protested from their seats. “Carrie Lam step down,” Council Front lawmaker Eddie Chu Hoi-dick chanted, describing her as “useless”. Civic Party lawmaker Kwok Ka-ki challenged Lam, saying the violence was brought on by police’s use of force. Rejecting allegations of police misconduct, Lam said: “I do not accept people describing the handling of the seven-months-long social unrest as involving police brutality. “If no one was breaking the law, why would police be enforcing the law?” Lam was interrupted by Council Front legislator Claudia Mo Man-ching, who called the chief executive a liar before being ejected. The city’s leader had earlier rejected a popular demand from the public to set up an independent, judge-led probe into police’s use of force during the protests. What is the Sino-British Joint Declaration? 5 Jul 2019 What is the Sino-British Joint Declaration? 5 Jul 2019 Other unmet demands from the anti-government movement include amnesty for those arrested and a revival of the city’s stalled political reform process. Since last June, activists have held peaceful mass protests to champion their cause, but radical elements have resorted to hurling petrol bombs and other violent attacks, while police have deployed tear gas, rubber bullets and even live rounds. Legco president Andrew Leung Kwan-yuen expelled Chu and 10 other pro-democracy lawmakers from the chamber during Thursday’s session.   Pro-Beijing lawmaker Michael Luk Chung-hung, of the Federation of Trade Unions, was also thrown out, for heckling the Democratic Party’s James To Kun-sun. In the 1½-hour session, legislators also questioned Lam on the city’s economy and support for its workforce. Pro-government lawmakers were also on the offensive, challenging Lam over her handling of the protests. Eunice Yung Hoi-yan of the New People’s Party demanded Lam and her cabinet took a 10 per cent pay cut as a way of taking some responsibility for the political crisis. “No cabinet member has resigned and you are unwilling to cut ministers’ salaries ... how can you convince the public that you are willing to be held accountable?” Yung asked. Lam responded that no one had handled unrest on a similar scale before. “My cabinet and I must deal with the current deadlock if we are to be responsible,” she said. Pro-government lawmaker, Chan Hoi-yan, asked why a new HK$10 billion welfare package announced on Tuesday was not brought forward earlier, saying: “If the government thought there was an urgency to the measures, why not propose them at the policy address three months earlier?” policy address 	SCMP

The force made the first arrests on Tuesday in a subdivided flat in Mong Kok and in Ho Par village in Sheung Shui, detaining four suspects, three of whom were students. The fourth suspect, a 29-year-old mechanic, was found in a flat that police described as a makeshift laboratory for making bombs. The bomb, the first such improvised explosive device found in the city, was also recovered. Some 40 grams of low explosives were inside the bomb, but it remains unclear what the substance was. Senior Superintendent Chan Tin-chu said the device, discovered on Tuesday evening, was ready to be used, and was powerful enough to kill. Six more suspected members of the group were arrested on Wednesday as police continued their operation and raided several flats citywide. Those arrested included two students, a kindergarten teacher, a barista, and two unemployed men.  Police also found marijuana and communication devices.

Chan said the device would have been used to target police or the department’s facilities, according to intelligence gathered.  “The bomb was planned to be used at a large public event to attack police or their facilities, and cause a large number of casualties,” he said.

Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s administration responded on Wednesday to the US group’s annual report, which accused the city’s police of beating subdued protesters and allowing suspected gang members to roam free after attacking pro-democracy lawmakers. Immigration officials at Hong Kong International Airport denied Kenneth Roth, the group’s executive director, entry into the city on Sunday, three days before he was expected to unveil the 652-page report, which documents human rights abuses around the world, at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club. The report used a picture of Hong Kong’s ongoing protests, triggered in June by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, as its cover image, and gave extensive coverage to the protests when it wrote about the city. New Year’s Eve protests in Hong Kong New Year’s Eve protests in Hong Kong “If members of the public could express their views in a peaceful and rational manner, there would be no need for the police to use any force,” a government spokesman said on Wednesday. While the report noted that most protesters were peaceful, it acknowledged some had thrown petrol bombs at police and attacked those perceived as pro-Beijing, including setting a man on fire.  The government spokesman said even though the group had mentioned those violent acts in its report, many of the 1,200 protests and rallies since June had ended in violence. “In response, police have been carrying out enforcement actions in strict accordance with the law in order to protect life and property and restore order to society,” he said. He added that the city’s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, and its Bill of Rights, guaranteed rights to freedom and the government “attached great weight” to them.  The human rights group also said Hong Kong’s limited freedom, under “one country, two systems” was being severely damaged, and cited the threat by Cathay Pacific to fire employees in Hong Kong who supported or took part in the protests, after Beijing warned it would impose flying restrictions on the airline.  Human Rights Watch’s report attributed the ongoing protests to the government’s failure to respond to demonstrators’ demands, including universal suffrage and an independent inquiry on alleged police abuses. Hong Kong police may arm officers with electroshock devices, net guns 21 Jan 2020 Hong Kong police may arm officers with electroshock devices, net guns 21 Jan 2020 The spokesman said the government had tried to introduce electoral reform between 2013 and 2015, but it was shot down by the legislature. At the time, pan-democrats refused to accept the proposal because, despite the one-person-one-vote arrangement, candidates for chief executive were to be pre-selected, according to a decision handed down by the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, Beijing’s top legislative body. “The HKSAR government will assess the situation carefully and take forward constitutional development in accordance with the Basic Law and the relevant interpretation and decisions of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress,” the government’s spokesman said.

In his first public speech as the new director of the central government’s liaison office in the city, Luo Huining struck a measured, conciliatory note on Wednesday, appealing to all stakeholders to safeguard Hong Kong’s core values for a better future and reaching out to disgruntled youth in particular. But he also spelled out Beijing’s key conditions, demanding an end to anti-government protest violence, urging civil servants to do their part, and insisting on the need to recognise “one country” while cherishing “two systems”. “We believe that Hong Kong, our home, will continue to make us proud so long as people who love the country and Hong Kong work in unity, 180,000 civil servants fulfil their responsibilities, and all sectors of society make joint efforts to firmly uphold the core values of the rule of law and resolutely support the special administrative region government in its effective administration in accordance with the law,” he said. “Hong Kong is a diversified society in which it comes as no surprise that there are different views and even significant disagreements on some specific issues … No issues among family members, no matter how serious they are, cannot be solved if consultations and discussions are conducted.” Addressing guests at his office’s Lunar New Year reception, including pro-establishment politicians and members of the business elite, the man who replaced Wang Zhimin as director in a surprise move announced on January 4 praised embattled Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor for her courage in handling Hong Kong’s “ordeal” since last June.  The priority was to end the violence and chaos, first sparked by the government’s now-withdrawn extradition bill, as well as to restore social order, he stressed. “Despite our differences in political views, all should agree that recognising ‘one country’ and cherishing ‘two systems’ will be key to securing Hong Kong people’s livelihood as well as the region’s future,” he said. “Hong Kong will usher in a new chapter of ‘When Hong Kong is good, so is the country; when the country is good, Hong Kong will be better’.” It is sincerely hoped that the Hong Kong youth foster the sense of national identity Luo Huining, liaison office chief Luo warned that straying from Beijing’s governing formula would result in conflict and chaos.  He gave an assurance that the central government would provide Hongkongers, especially the city’s youth, with opportunities for development and room for growth.  “Hong Kong’s young people are sons and daughters of the big family of the Chinese nation. They are also the major force of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as well as Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability,” he said. “It is sincerely hoped that the Hong Kong youth foster the sense of national identity.” ‘Key moment to stop Hong Kong protest chaos’: Beijing’s liaison office 25 Dec 2019 ‘Key moment to stop Hong Kong protest chaos’: Beijing’s liaison office 25 Dec 2019 Ip Kwok-him, a local delegate to China’s parliament and an adviser to the chief executive, saw Luo’s speech as a reflection of Beijing’s recognition of Lam’s efforts to restore order. “His praise for Lam shows that Beijing wants the pro-establishment camp and various sectors in society to support the government’s strategies to bring Hong Kong back to normal,” he said. Pro-establishment lawmaker Ma Fung-kwok said Luo’s emphasis on youth showed Beijing was prioritising the need to foster a sense of national identity. While opposition pan-democratic lawmakers were not invited to the reception, Ma said it did not mean the new envoy was refusing to communicate with them. I thought the purpose of setting up the liaison office is to liaise with everybody in Hong Kong, and not just a small circle of their own people. The central government should have embraced different voices Alvin Yeung, opposition legislator “It just makes sense for the liaison office not to invite people to launch protests on a solemn occasion,” he said. But lawmaker Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu of the opposition Civic Party said the snub indicated the office’s attitude towards them would not change under the new director. “I thought the purpose of setting up the liaison office is to liaise with everybody in Hong Kong, and not just a small circle of their own people,” Yeung said. “The central government should have embraced different voices.” Yeung admitted his party members would have boycotted the reception even if they had been invited, but added: “You should not second-guess what the people you invite will do.” Protesters vandalise Beijing’s office in Hong Kong Protesters vandalise Beijing’s office in Hong Kong Democratic Party chairman Wu Chi-wai said Beijing’s approach to Hong Kong affairs was far more important than matters such as the reception. “All of society is looking at whether the Beijing and Hong Kong governments have new approaches to governing the city, to respond to societal demands,” Wu said. “You cannot ignore the protest movement that has lasted more than seven months.” Additional reporting by Sum Lok-kei Additional reporting by Sum Lok-kei 	SCMP

West Kowloon Magistrates’ Court heard that Wong Siu-hong, 20, took an extendable baton, some first-aid items, a respirator, a pair of safety goggles and a trekking pole with him to work on September 21 as he planned to join an anti-government protest later that day. But guards at Hong Kong International Airport detected the items when Wong went through security on his way to the restricted zone. Police were alerted immediately. Wong, an employee of China Aviation Services, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to one count of possessing offensive weapons. Principal Magistrate Peter Law Tak-chuen sought a variety of reports to study sentencing options, ranging from probation or community orders to time at training or rehabilitation centres. He adjourned sentencing to February 7, remanding Wong in jail custody until then.  The court heard the cleaner arrived at the security checkpoint for airport staff at 6.35am on September 21. When he sent his bag and a rucksack through an X-ray machine, the items inside alerted two security personnel, who then opened his bag to find the baton.

He told police officers that he owned the items. He intended to take part in a protest in Tuen Mun after work that day, so he wanted to place the items in his personal locker while at work, he said.  Hong Kong has since June last year been gripped by anti-government protests, sparked by anger at a piece of extradition legislation. Though the bill was withdrawn in September, the protests have morphed into a wider movement demanding greater democracy and more police accountability.

He said he bought the trekking pole for HK$100 (US$13). He said he had taken the items along for self-defence because he feared he might be attacked by people aggrieved by the protests. Extendable batons were at the centre of another controversy at the airport last month, when security personnel intercepted an off-duty police officer with one at a checkpoint. Police top brass said the officer had been warned over the incident. 	SCMP

The city’s consumer watchdog said people should make sure they know the requirements for the country they want to move to, and should not put all their trust in consultants or agencies. The warning from the Consumer Council came after complaints regarding consultants shot up 62.5 per cent last year, as more and more people look to flee for a fresh start abroad. In one case, a family paid an agency HK$400,000 (US$51,000) in the hope of relocating to the United States, but more than three years later the application has stalled. The family is trying to get a refund and the case is unresolved. The council also highlighted the case of a company that used a variety of selling tactics, including saying there would be “no charge for an unsuccessful application”, to persuade a man to spend HK$78,000 on an investment immigration application, so he could relocate to Canada. That application was ultimately rejected and the firm disputed his demand for a refund.  Gilly Wong Fung-han, the council’s chief executive, said consumers should spend some time to equip themselves with better knowledge of the entry requirements for a country. “Don’t put all your trust on the immigration consultancy. Emigration requirements for different countries have listed quite clearly online,” she said.  “Even if you have to use some immigration consultancy service firms, when you have already clearly understood the requirements of the country … then your application won’t be easily delayed by others’ excuses. You may also save some money.”   In the case of the man hoping to move to Canada, the firm involved also suggested he pay an extra HK$46,664 to hire a local lawyer to help him manage difficult situations during interviews. The man declined the offer as he did not believe it was necessary.  Eventually, Canadian authorities rejected the application because the man could not present some financial information, and the firm refused to give him a refund. The council said an employee at the firm told the man he was denied a refund because he did not employ a local lawyer as recommended, which the staffer claimed was the reason behind the application’s failure. But, in a response to the council, the firm said it had told the man part of the income information might not be sufficient for the application, and said the contract stated no refund would be offered if authorities rejected applications because of the failure to provide the required documents. The complainant did not follow up further on the case, but told the council the company could be more prudent in assessing the application’s information, and should immediately tell a client if they spotted any issues with an application. More than 40 per cent of Hongkongers want to emigrate amid ongoing protests, survey finds 11 Oct 2019 More than 40 per cent of Hongkongers want to emigrate amid ongoing protests, survey finds 11 Oct 2019 Wong said consumers should study the terms and conditions of a contract carefully as companies offering refunds for an unsuccessful application usually use different clauses to define service failure. In total, the council received 13 complaints in 2019, up from the eight made the previous year. Among those complainants was a man who signed a HK$75,000 deal with a company for a British entrepreneur immigration visa. The man agreed to pay another £30,000 (HK$303,300) for the firm’s British lawyer to prepare a business proposal, with half of the total amount payable upfront. Delays meant the application was likely to miss a crucial date in March, when British immigration policy was expected to change, and the man cancelled the service and appointed another British lawyer to reapply for him. The firm involved refused to refund his money after the council got involved, and said it had complied with the client’s request to cancel the service. The council advised consumers to ensure key dates and goals were agreed if they signed a contract with an immigration agency, to avoid the loss of time and money. 	SCMP

Secretary for Labour and Welfare Law Chi-kwong was referring to a plan to combine two old-age living allowance schemes into one subsidy worth HK$3,585 (US$461) a month, giving 50,000 recipients of the scheme an extra HK$910 per month. About 100,000 more senior citizens are expected to become eligible for the allowance after the government raised the asset limit for the recipients to HK$500,000. The revamp will cost an extra HK$5 billion a year. The new initiative has been described as “close to a universal pension scheme” by a cabinet member. It was part of a HK$10 billion-a-year, 10-measure welfare package Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor unveiled on Tuesday to ease the burden on the city’s poor and elderly amid the economic downturn, which has been intensified by the civil unrest that has rocked Hong Kong since June. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announces HK$10 billion welfare package 15 Jan 2020 Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announces HK$10 billion welfare package 15 Jan 2020 Speaking on a radio show on Wednesday morning, the minister admitted the measures would pose a burden on the government’s coffers, but argued the impact would be significantly lower in the long run.  “The proportion of people receiving the old-age allowance will gradually decrease in the future as they will be protected by the Mandatory Provident Fund,” said Law, referring to the compulsory pension fund introduced in 2000. He said though the city would record an annual growth of 4.5 per cent in the amount spent on elderly citizens in the coming decade on average, the pace would slow to 3.5 per cent in the decade after.  Law also defended the government’s U-turn to expand the fare concession scheme that will soon allow residents aged 60 and above – from the current benchmark of 65 – to travel on public transport for just HK$2 a ride. U-turn Officials had earlier cautioned against the idea, pointing to the enormous cost the city would incur. The threshold for the elderly Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) was recently raised from 60 rather than 65, responding to the rising life expectancy and the trend of retiring at 65. Economists take aim at Carrie Lam’s HK$10 billion welfare package 15 Jan 2020 Economists take aim at Carrie Lam’s HK$10 billion welfare package 15 Jan 2020 But Law on Wednesday explained that more than half of the people aged between 60 and 64 were not working, and he believed the new scheme would encourage them to return to the job market, travel more, or work as volunteers.  However, he admitted the age threshold of welfare policies should still be increased gradually with the rising life expectancy. Speaking on another radio programme, the chairman of the Elderly Commission, Dr Lam Ching-choi, also an adviser to the city leader in the Executive Council, described the revamped old-age allowance scheme as being similar to a universal pension scheme, which had been a long-standing demand of civil society. The commission chairman also dismissed the suggestion that the government had excluded young people from the latest raft of measures. “The measures may not seem to target young people directly, but have many of their ‘footprints’. They may help narrow the wealth gap and bring about a just society – this is a way to respond to the demands and values of young people,” he said. He also said the measures had reflected a change in the administration’s attitude towards governing the city in the wake of the protests, as they had been trying hard to get closer to the people.

In 2019, arrival figures dropped to 55.9 million from 65.15 million the year before, dragged down by a 14.2 per cent decline in mainland Chinese, who accounted for the bulk of visitors to the city, the Tourism Board said. Overnight visitors, who spend more, tumbled 18.8 per cent to 23.76 million. The news came as Hong Kong continues to be gripped by civil unrest, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. The campaign has since morphed into a wider movement against the government and police, often ending in violent clashes between demonstrators and officers. “Hong Kong’s tourism industry has faced exceptional challenges over the past year, but I have every confidence in our resilience and appeal as a world-class travel destination,” board chairman Pang Yiu-kai said. “We are working tirelessly on a major global promotion that will rebuild the city’s image as a destination and help our tourism industry recover.” Secrets of Hong Kong’s pyrotechnic power Secrets of Hong Kong’s pyrotechnic power He referred to the online platform called “Hong Kong is On”, which was launched early last month and provides more than 500 offers on flights, hotels, dining, retail and attractions. Despite its efforts to promote the city, the government chose to axe the signature fireworks at Victoria Harbour, which were scheduled for the second day of Lunar New Year celebrations on January 26, blaming the “current situation”.  Tourism lawmaker Yiu Si-wing earlier said the government had safety concerns, as the protests engulfing the city showed little sign of abating.

The months-long protests prompted the city’s tourist arrivals to contract 39.1 per cent in the second half of the last year, offsetting the 13.9 per cent growth in the first half. More than 40 jurisdictions have issued travel warnings or advisories against heading to Hong Kong. Home affairs minister Lau Kong-wah attributed the government’s decision to drop the Lunar New Year fireworks to “the current situation”. “After careful assessment, we decided to cancel the fireworks based on public safety concerns,” the minister said on Wednesday.

Convenor of the pro-democracy camp Tanya Chan Suk-chong said she could not understand the logic behind the cancellation, saying it had dealt another blow to Hong Kong’s reputation. Referring to the strength of police firepower and proposals for more weaponry, she said: “I don’t understand why police have no confidence in ensuring public safety.” proposals for more weaponry Chan said the administration lacked the will to properly govern the city, and urged Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to respond to the anti-government protesters’ five key demands.

Post “It benefits both officers and suspects, as the longer the suspect resists or struggles [during arrest], the higher the chance we both get hurt.”  On Wednesday, Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu did not deny electroshock devices were being considered for deployment, when asked by a lawmaker in a Legislative Council meeting. “Police will take appropriate force against any illegal acts, and the Security Bureau supports any method to better enable the force to deal with violence while reducing casualties,” Lee said.  “Any equipment being studied by police are already in use by [police] forces in foreign countries and have a good track record in reducing casualties. These studies are ongoing.”  The exploration of new hardware comes after police reviewed Operation Tiderider, which was launched in June last year to deal with street protests. Nearly 7,000 people have been arrested, the youngest aged 11, over the civil unrest, which was sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill and is now into its eighth month after developing into a wider anti-government campaign. civil unrest extradition bill A guide to weapons police use on extradition bill protesters 12 Aug 2019 A guide to weapons police use on extradition bill protesters 12 Aug 2019 Masked radicals in the movement have trashed railway stations and businesses with links to mainland China, occupied the airport and universities, and set roadblocks on major thoroughfares.    Since June, police have fired more than 16,000 rounds of tear gas, 10,000 rubber bullets, 2,000 beanbag rounds and 19 live rounds. Tasers and stun guns – devices that deliver a modulated electric current designed to disrupt voluntary control of muscles – are used by law enforcers overseas, including those in the United States, Britain, Australia and Singapore. American, Japanese and Taiwanese police are also equipped with net guns, which release material to entangle the target. Legal test for warrants that let Hong Kong police search phones 14 Jan 2020 Legal test for warrants that let Hong Kong police search phones 14 Jan 2020 The Post was told that Hong Kong police tested stun devices in the wake of the Mong Kok riot in 2016, when hundreds went on a rampage on the first night of Lunar New Year after a crackdown on illegal food hawkers. Post But the force then did not take the idea forward due to health and political concerns. The proposal resurfaced recently alongside deterioration in the social situation.   Chairman of the Junior Police Officers’ Association, Lam Chi-wai, welcomed any weapons that helped increase the distance between police and suspects, as he said officers were “having brushes with death” when “dealing with the mobs”. “These weapons are less lethal and the effects on suspects are temporary. If they were adopted along appropriate tactics and guidelines, I believe they can boost the force’s capability to curb violence,” Lam said. According to data collected by Amnesty International, at least 500 people in the US died between 2001 and 2012 after being tasered during arrest or while in custody. The group has called for tighter restrictions on such weapons, adding they should only be used in situations where police would otherwise consider using firearms. Hong Kong protesters got training from foreign forces, security chief says 9 Jan 2020 Hong Kong protesters got training from foreign forces, security chief says 9 Jan 2020 Another police insider said the force would study and test the side effects before adopting any new weapon. “The effectiveness of pepper spray has decreased as protesters now have better protective gear,” he said. “Every tool, including batons, can kill if wrongly used. But stun devices are mainstream and less lethal. Figures tell us that only 13 out of one million individuals could die from or be severely injured by stun devices. “Its level of force is even below pepper spray in America.” But the source admitted arming officers with net guns was “less likely” because initial investigation had found it was not easy to trap a particular target in a crowd. Security consultant and former police superintendent Clement Lai Ka-chi, who helped set up the force’s counterterrorism response unit, said even private security officers used stun devices, because the temporary electroshock could avoid physical confrontations between police and suspects. He added the new range would introduce choice at levels between pepper spray, tear gas and firearms, whereas using net guns could help stop suspects from hurling petrol bombs, for example. whereas using net guns could help stop suspects from hurling petrol bombs, for example. “Being Asia’s finest is not only about police performance, but also the choice of equipment. The new weapons help prevent the loss of lives,” Lai said. “Officers can choose not to fire a warning shot in a violent situation.”   Despite the benefits, Lai said using stun guns might bring unexpected consequences when used on suspects with hidden health conditions. Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor director Law Yuk-kai said the new equipment was “unnecessary” because police had enough options to handle suspects and warned that electroshock could endanger the lives of those suffering from chronic heart disease. Law said the devices would make it easier for police to “mask their brutality”, adding: “People can still count the times [officers] hit a suspect with a baton. “But if a taser is in use, you can’t tell if a suspect has suffered because of the electroshock or of the physical confrontation.” A police spokesman said the force had been considering the sourcing and procurement of various equipment to enhance operational efficiency. “Details of the procurement will not be disclosed due to operational considerations,” he said.

But he is an outlier. According to a new survey released over the weekend by the Hong Kong Guangdong Youth Association, a privately funded foundation focused on promoting cross-border exchanges, more than 70 per cent of the young people in Hong Kong they interviewed held that the city should keep its distance from mainland China. More than half believed that universities in Hong Kong should not open their door to mainland Chinese students. The study, which comprised six focus groups with about 200 interviewees in Hong Kong aged between 15 to 64, was conducted late last year after anti-government protests broke out in the city.   It was conducted to “better understand young people’s views on the mainland and the Greater Bay Area”.  While Hong Kong has been embroiled in more than six months of anti-government protests triggered by a now withdrawn extradition bill, cross-border animosity, especially among young people, was often cited as a factor that has fuelled the unrest. “Almost 60 per cent of those interviewed said the Greater Bay Area plan would bring more harm than good to Hong Kong, and about half said the growing trend of mainlanders coming to Hong Kong for study and work has negative impact,” a report of the study said.  Citing factors such as lack of trust in the mainland’s medical system, information barriers and low recognition of China’s university qualifications, the majority of the young people interviewed rejected the idea of moving to Greater Bay Area for work or study.  “With the protests in Hong Kong, it can be foreseen that there will be even fewer young people from Hong Kong who would be willing to participate in the development of the Greater Bay Area,” it said. China’s Greater Bay Area dwarfs US counterpart but still looks to unlock the secret of its success 16 Feb 2020 China’s Greater Bay Area dwarfs US counterpart but still looks to unlock the secret of its success 16 Feb 2020 The Greater Bay Area plan is a grand vision by Beijing to turn nine Pearl River Delta cities along with Hong Kong and Macau into a regional economic and business hub that can compete with Tokyo or San Francisco’s bay areas.  Yuen, who graduated from Jinan University in Guangzhou two years ago, was one of those who took the opportunity and set up a small business catering to clients in Panyu’s fast-growing business community. ‘The subsidies are helpful and we can enjoy pretty good medical services here,” said Yuen who received 50,000 yuan (US$7,250) as a start-up grant from the Guangdong government. “Unlike Hong Kong, I can afford to fail here and may even come back a second time if my business cannot make it,” he said, admitting that his delivery business has yet to make a profit. “The biggest problem is actually about sending my four-year-old boy to school because the international schools here are expensive and state schools require us to have local residency that we don’t,” he added. While Yuen would continue to press ahead with his business, he lamented that his choice has alienated his friends in Hong Kong. “My buddies from school in Hong Kong are no longer talking to me since the protests broke out last summer and I can’t tell them how much the mainland has changed,” he said. “They have blacklisted me [on Facebook] and I don’t think they would ever come visit me in China.” Singapore and China eye deeper ties in Greater Bay Area project 18 Dec 2019 Singapore and China eye deeper ties in Greater Bay Area project 18 Dec 2019 Yang Aiping, a professor who studied Hong Kong and Macau affairs at South China Normal University, agreed that while local graduates like Yuen may me more accepting towards ideas such as the Greater Bay Area plan, most young people in Hong Kong felt estranged about the mainland. Yang, who has researched about youth issues in Hong Kong, said Beijing would struggle to make the Greater Bay Area idea appealing to young people who are not interested in the mainland in the first place. Adam Kwok Kai-fai, a founder of Hong Kong Guangdong Youth Association, suggested that the Hong Kong government should take steps to ease the sense of competition between young people from both sides in areas such as education and employment. These include reducing the quota of mainlanders allowed to relocate to Hong Kong and providing matching job opportunities for Hong Kong and mainland graduates.

China has embarked on a global promotional campaign to blunt criticism of its human rights record and has received the support of governments in Russia, Syria, North Korea, Myanmar, Belarus and Saudi Arabia. More concerning, said the report, is that “several important governments have been missing in action”. “That included the US and the European Union, which has been diverted by Brexit, and find it difficult to find a common voice in human rights.” “That included the US and the European Union, which has been diverted by Brexit, and find it difficult to find a common voice in human rights.” Hong Kong immigration denies entry to Human Rights Watch executive director Hong Kong immigration denies entry to Human Rights Watch executive director “Others, like Pakistan, are simply bought off.

Xing said China was a great success story because it had freed its people from poverty, to which Sophie Richardson, the China director at Human Rights Watch, responded: “The Chinese people got themselves out of poverty after the government took the boot off of their neck.” Rally in Hong Kong to thank US for supporting the Human Rights and Democracy Act Rally in Hong Kong to thank US for supporting the Human Rights and Democracy Act Beijing has made the UN a primary target as it has routinely worked against proposed measures and the global human rights framework, the report said. “The Chinese government’s attacks on human rights systems must be stopped,” Roth said. “The ascent of a global threat to rights is not unstoppable. The governments should band together.” Roth, an American citizen, returned to the United States after being barred from entering Hong Kong at the city’s international airport on Sunday. On December 2, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the government would impose sanctions against Human Rights Watch and four other US-based non-profit groups that “played an egregious role” in the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Those remarks came after Trump signed into law the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which could pave the way for diplomatic action and economic sanctions against the city’s government.

Two of the suspects, tertiary students aged 21 and 22, were arrested in Mong Kok and police believe they have links to a radical anti-government protest group. anti-government protest The third man, a 29-year-old electrician, was detained in Sheung Shui in what police called a makeshift laboratory where bombs were being made. “The pipe bomb was very powerful and a small explosion occurred while it was being defused. The shrapnel punched a hole in one of the lifts in the flat,” Senior Superintendent Chan Tin-chu said at a briefing at the scene. He said the bomb was ready to be used and powerful enough to kill if it had been thrown into a car. Police said they stopped three men as they were leaving the Lee Man Building on Tung Choi Street on Tuesday afternoon. Officers brought them back to the flat and found “protest-related materials” and the pipe bomb.  The police’s explosive ordnance disposal unit arrived at around 10.30pm and evacuated nearby residents. Chan said they found about 40 grams of explosives inside the bomb but it was still unclear what the substance was, or if it was linked to previous cases. “We will further investigate and if necessary, consider arresting everyone connected to the radical protest group,” Chan said.

Of the HK$10 billion-a-year package unveiled on Tuesday by Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, the measure which courted the most controversy was the expansion of the fare concession scheme, which allows residents aged 60 or above – rather than the current 65 – to travel on public transport for just HK$2 a trip. HK$10 billion-a-year package Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor Economist Andy Kwan Cheuk-chiu poured scorn on the measure, which Lam said was to encourage employment. “It is not difficult for people aged 60 to 64 to find jobs in Hong Kong,” Kwan, director of ACE Centre for Business and Economic Research, said. “The measure is redundant. It would make more sense to put more effort into encouraging employment among those aged 65 or above.” Kwan also warned the cost of the scheme would balloon amid a fast-greying population, and said public transport operators – such as the MTR Corporation – would be the biggest beneficiaries. MTR Corporation  Around one-third of the population in Hong Kong will be aged 60 or above by 2030, according to government estimates. Embattled Maxim’s grants staff bonus for work during protests 14 Jan 2020 Embattled Maxim’s grants staff bonus for work during protests 14 Jan 2020 The Labour Party accused the government of making a U-turn on its policies. The government had previously raised the age threshold for the elderly Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) from 60 to 65, saying it was responding to the rising life expectancy and the trend of retiring at 65. The party said the government should demand the transport operators fulfil their social responsibility by bearing part of the expense, rather than just benefiting.  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Law Chi-kwong on Tuesday said that the eligible age of different policies would vary depending on their aims.  “There is no single line drawn,” he said. It doesn’t matter whether I can travel for HK$2 or not. What matters is whether one can still find a job when one is already over 60 Wong, retiree Law said the government was considering calling services for those aged 60 to 64 as being for the “silver aged”, a reference to the concept of the “silver haired market”. May Wong, 61, who lives in Mong Kok and works at a garment stall in Causeway Bay, said she could save more than HK$400 per month under the new scheme. She said the subsidy would allow her to travel to the countryside and believed it could encourage more people aged over 60 to return to the workforce. Enhanced welfare package will lift some 27,000 people out of poverty 14 Jan 2020 Enhanced welfare package will lift some 27,000 people out of poverty 14 Jan 2020 But a retiree, also surnamed Wong, 60, said the scheme had no relevance to his job-seeking plans. “It doesn’t matter whether I can travel for HK$2 or not. What matters is whether one can still find a job when one is already over 60,” he said. Lulu Chan, 64, believed few people over the age of 60 would choose to work again. “Those who are above 60 and already working don’t really care too much about the HK$2,” she said. Chan, who works in Causeway Bay as a shopkeeper, said she lived nearby so she would not be able to save much from the scheme. Holden Chow Ho-ding, vice-chairman of the pro-establishment Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, said they were glad the government finally responded to their proposal, made a few years ago, to extend travel subsidies to residents aged 60 or above. Meanwhile, other major measures announced on Tuesday included a gradual increase in the number of statutory holidays to 17, benefiting blue-collar workers who only get 12 public holidays each year. But Felix Chung Kwok-pan, leader of the business-friendly Liberal Party, said they were not consulted beforehand, and he believed it would take 10 to 15 years to implement the measure given the lack of consensus in society. “It is more like lip service to woo the public for now,” he said. The Business and Professionals Alliance also urged the government to listen to the views of the sector on increasing the holidays to avoid any backlash.

But the agency refused to reveal details of its probe into accusations against police of failing to protect the public in the Yuen Long mob attacks last July, only pledging to look at the case thoroughly. The remarks by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) were made on Tuesday at an annual graft review of the city, given by four advisory committees of the watchdog. They described the civil unrest, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill and into its eighth month, as “posing great challenges to ICAC’s work”. “We have a heavier workload and the work is more complicated. The figures do not tell the whole story,” said Benjamin Tang Kwok-bun, chairman of ICAC’s operations review committee, which monitors investigations. Tang said the agency received 2,297, or 14 per cent fewer non-election corruption complaints last year compared with 2,665 cases in 2018. Around 76 per cent of such cases were pursuable.  For election-based complaints – stemming from the district council polls in November – the agency said it received 518 cases by the end of 2019, of which 95 per cent were pursuable. The figures do not tell the whole story Benjamin Tang, chairman, ICAC operations review committee  ICAC’s biennial review report for 2015 and 2016 showed it received 1,065 complaints from district council elections then, but the pursuable rate was not stated. “A case can be more complicated than another. The number of cases received do not show our entire workload. ICAC is facing the same problems as the rest of society amid this unrest,” Tang said of the latest statistics.  He did not reveal the total number of complaints linked to protests, saying it was inappropriate to touch on cases.  The committees confirmed that ICAC had received complaints over police conduct, centred on the events of the night of July 21, when a group of white-clad men with wooden sticks and metal poles attacked commuters and protesters indiscriminately in Yuen Long MTR station, injuring 45.   Police were accused of showing up late to restore order, when officers took 35 minutes to arrive. Top police brass had countered that manpower was tied up that night with violent protests on Hong Kong Island, while officers in Yuen Long were busy attending to other emergencies. According to sources, ICAC had set up a dedicated group to handle the investigation. But Tang refused to confirm the arrangement or comment on the case, only saying there was a clear division of labour within teams. “Please rest assured that our committee members will follow up on each case. The investigating team will not terminate the probe without our agreement,” Tang added. Corruption watchdog charges two for ‘lucky bags’ vote buying at by-elections 8 Oct 2019 Corruption watchdog charges two for ‘lucky bags’ vote buying at by-elections 8 Oct 2019 Overall, about two-thirds of non-election complaints involved the private sector, while 28 per cent were related to government departments and 7 per cent, public bodies. All categories recorded drops compared with 2018. In 2019, 134 people in 86 non-election cases were prosecuted.The conviction rate for this category dropped slightly from 80 per cent to 79 per cent. Tang said the reason for the drop in the number of cases was unknown, and ICAC could not determine if it was linked to the social unrest. He added that many factors, such as better anti-corruption awareness, could be attributed to the result. 	SCMP

Lam has been reluctant to set up a commission of inquiry with the power to summon witnesses, instead repeatedly saying she preferred to appoint a panel of experts to study a broad array of societal issues. has been reluctant to set up a commission of inquiry  “Nevertheless, the Hong Kong Bar Association remains of the view that the setting of a commission of inquiry would go a long way in healing the rifts in our community by providing closure through an open investigation into events which had affected the lives of many of our citizens,” wrote Bar Association chairman Philip Dykes SC. In the 67-page bilingual submission, the association suggested the inquiry cover 15 major incidents from June to November, including fierce clashes at Chinese University and Polytechnic University. Polytechnic University Among the 10 suggested areas the inquiry should cover are the use of force by police and protesters, the wearing of masks by demonstrators and officers, problems with arrests, the response of the government and police force, health issues arising from weapons used by various sides, and protesters’ funding sources. the wearing of masks by demonstrators and officers  The legal body said the issue of use of force should be given priority, noting public concerns over police’s handling of the protests in various opinion polls. In Hong Kong protests, did police use excessive force or issue a proportional response? 14 Jun 2019 In Hong Kong protests, did police use excessive force or issue a proportional response? 14 Jun 2019 It said it recommended the inquiry cover the protesters’ use of force as well, as it would not be comprehensive or fair otherwise. As to the composition of the panel, the association suggested that either a retired top judge or current non-permanent judge from the Court of Final Appeal be invited to chair the inquiry, after consultation with the judiciary, Law Society and Bar Association.  It said all but two previous inquiries, in 1968 and 1973, have been chaired by judges, lending authority and credibility to what was a judicial proceeding itself.  The remaining six members in the proposed setting could include one doctor, one sociologist, one active or retired police officer or policing expert, one protester or civil activist, and a lay member picked from a jurors list. “The suggestion to include a police and a protester representative is to ensure that the views, knowledge and experiences of important actors of the unrest are heard in the decision making process of the commission of inquiry,” the submission read. “Such participation is important to ensure the findings and recommendations of the COI are as grounded in reality as possible.” Worsening levels of violence in Hong Kong protests has supporters questioning radical actions – but government still blamed for trouble 15 Nov 2019 Worsening levels of violence in Hong Kong protests has supporters questioning radical actions – but government still blamed for trouble 15 Nov 2019 The association made reference to the diverse membership of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa in 1996 and the independent commission on policing for Northern Ireland in 1998. Two political activists and a third health care specialist on violence and trauma rehabilitation were among the 15 members appointed in the South African case, while one serving police officer and three police experts were involved in the inquiry in Northern Ireland. While Lam has repeatedly suggested a review committee comprised of experts, the association said that set-ups lack of legal powers would fail to address the critical issue of culpability. “Only when there is open inquiry by a commission of inquiry equipped with the statutory powers to assist it in finding truth and accountability, can there be genuine possibilities of restoration of trust and reconciliation,” the association said.

The company on Monday gave HK$2,000 (US$257) to each permanent staff member and HK$1,000 to each part-timer as gratitude for their contributions during the past months of unrest, according to an internal letter the Post obtained on Tuesday. the past months of unrest Post The letter, issued by chairman and managing director Michael Wu, said the group’s operating environment had become difficult as a result of the social unrest and poor economy. He also predicted the coming year would continue to be engulfed in uncertainty. A spokeswoman said the payment was non-recurring and was separate from the group’s annual discretionary bonus.  “This is to recognise the staff’s contributions during the difficult time arising from the social incidents,” she said.

The website for Starbucks, which is operated by Maxim’s in Hong Kong, shows there are 50 outlets.

Rail operator the MTR Corporation, which has also been the target of violent protesters and has spent HK$1.6 billion (US$205 million) repairing vandalised station facilities, granted a similar payment. On December 31, the corporation awarded HK$2,000 to each full-time staff and HK$800 for each part-timer to recognise their contributions during the turmoil. As of November 24, radical protesters had caused extensive damage to 85 of 94 MTR stations, and 62 of 68 Light Rail stops. Turnstiles, ticketing machines, surveillance cameras, lifts, escalators and rolling shutters were damaged. Some 54 heavy railway trains and 16 Light Rail vehicles were damaged. Protesters dubbed the MTR Corp “Communist Party Rail” in August for what they saw as bowing to pressure from Beijing after state media accused it of facilitating mob action by running extra trains. MTR Corp denied it had kowtowed to Beijing. 	SCMP

HKU Alumni Concern Group said on Tuesday it had learnt that a “committee of inquiry into possible good cause” had been initiated by the university to look into Benny Tai Yiu-ting’s teaching position, and a fresh round of verbal deliberation on his case would be held this week. The associate professor of law was in April last year sentenced to 16 months in prison over two public nuisance charges related to the civil disobedience movement in 2014, during which protesters brought several parts of the city to a standstill for 79 straight days seeking greater democracy. He was granted bail in August pending an appeal, as his leave to appeal will be handled by the Court of Appeal next month. Concern group deputy convenor Mak Tung-wing said the initiation of the verbal deliberation this week ahead of the commencement of the hearing on his appeal bid would be “a breach of procedural justice and a violation of the university’s core values”.  “Once [during] the point of deliberation, should Benny Tai’s appeal be [upheld], you waste all your time,” Mak said. Under HKU’s ordinance and procedures, vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang has the discretion to initiate the formation of an inquiry committee if he feels there is a “good cause” behind terminating Tai’s tenure. Dismissal on a good cause would need to show the accused tenured staff suffered from an “inability to perform efficiently the duties of the office”, had neglected his duty, or there had been “misconduct in an official or a private capacity”. Hong Kong Police to probe more than 200 Occupy protesters 20 Jun 2018 Hong Kong Police to probe more than 200 Occupy protesters 20 Jun 2018 Two sources said the inquiry committee against Tai was initiated last June following his conviction in April and it already exchanged correspondence with him. Tai is represented by a lawyer in the proceedings.    “The allegation Tai faced was that he committed misconduct due to the conviction over public nuisance [in Occupy trials], rendering him unfit to remain in office,” the source said. Tai said he would fight till the end. “I hope the procedure will be put to a stop, at least until the legal proceedings end,” he said, referring to the appeal hearing to be held on February 24. “The entire procedure should not have been triggered, because acts of civil disobedience should not come as a case of good cause for termination.” The five-member panel is chaired by HKU’s vice-president and provost, pro-establishment scholar Richard Wong Yue-chim. According to the established procedure, once the inquiry committee completes looking into the facts of the charges, it will send the report of findings back to the HKU senate – the principal academic authority with members formed by staff and students. The senate will then make a recommendation to the governing council for a decision on the termination of an employee. Benny Tai, serving jail term for co-founding 2014 Occupy protests, gets bail 15 Aug 2019 Benny Tai, serving jail term for co-founding 2014 Occupy protests, gets bail 15 Aug 2019 An appeal against the decision can be raised either through the chancellor – a role assumed by the city’s Chief Executive – or by judicial review. An HKU spokeswoman said the university had “stringent and impartial procedures in handling human resources matters”, which “clearly uphold and safeguard the teacher’s rights at every stage of the proceedings”. Acting dean of HKU’s faculty of law Professor Fu Hualing said Tai had been taking unpaid leave, but declined to comment on the inquiry procedure. “Benny is not teaching and has been taking unpaid leave,” Fu said, adding there was no established procedure on how the proceedings would move forward. The concern group will stage a rally at Edinburgh Place in Central on Wednesday to protest against the university’s handling of Tai’s case. The demonstration has been approved by police. 	SCMP

Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor on Tuesday said the city faced “unprecedented challenges” in dealing with the large number of arrests and possible prosecutions over the anti-government protests. anti-government protests “I am extremely grateful to the judiciary for devising various means at various levels of courts to try to speed up the cases, because we all want justice to be done effectively,” she said, before meeting her advisers at the Executive Council. Hong Kong has been rocked by anti-government protests since June last year, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. By January 2, just under 7,000 people had been arrested over the often-violent disturbances, and 1,051 prosecuted. extradition bill During an annual ceremony to open the legal year on Monday, Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma Tao-li spoke of a task force which had been set up to explore ways to speed up the trials of defendants charged over demonstrations in the past eight months. One way to speed up the trials is to extend the courts’ working hours. Lam said it was not the first time the chief justice informed the government of his intention to expedite the trials, adding that the judiciary had asked courts to devise appropriate means to that end.  “The administration will fully cooperate in terms of providing additional resources,” Lam said. Principal law lecturer Eric Cheung Tat-ming of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) said extra funding could be used to pay court workers’ wages if they were required to put in overtime, while a spokesman for the judiciary said overtime allowances were not applicable to judges or judicial officers. Cheung added that, since most cases were in their early stages, with prosecutors still in preparation, Ma appeared to be planning ahead.  The proposal would stand or fall on the manpower of judges and magistrates, he said. But the judiciary has struggled for years with recruitment, with only 156 of 218 posts filled as of March 2019.  For most lawyers, joining the bench means losing considerable income from private practice. It can even mean the end of friendships, as they cannot be seen to be too close to former colleagues. The judiciary sometimes appoints lawyers as deputy magistrates and judges through a temporary scheme, which Cheung noted could be a solution to the current problems. Dozens detained by police after march against parallel traders in Hong Kong’s Sheung Shui Dozens detained by police after march against parallel traders in Hong Kong’s Sheung Shui As of December 31, there were 35 deputy judges and judicial officers from outside the judiciary, including veteran lawyers and retired judges. Another 34 deputy judges and judicial officers were from within. The daily rate for a deputy judge at the High Court is HK$11,400, while that of a deputy District Court judge is HK$9,280. A deputy magistrate is paid HK$6,175 per day. But Cheung said the judiciary would be cautious in recruitment, to maintain the quality of the bench. In rare move, judiciary appoints two judges to hear challenges against anti-mask law 17 Oct 2019 In rare move, judiciary appoints two judges to hear challenges against anti-mask law 17 Oct 2019 HKU legal scholar Johannes Chan Man-mun agreed with Cheung on manpower. “Merely extending the court hours without increasing judicial manpower will not solve the problem, as you can’t expect a judge to work continuously for 18 to 20 hours a day,” he said, before noting the potential difficulty of getting lawyers and witnesses to court late at night. One executive councillor, Ronny Tong Ka-wah said extra funding should not be a problem for the government. But the senior barrister noted the deputies scheme might not be helpful in the short term, because talented lawyers’ diaries “might be full and any engagement would have been made at least six months or one year prior”. Ma said on Monday that while it was important to speed up cases, the guarantee of an impartial trial was also important. 	SCMP

In one reversal, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor plans to lower the age threshold for a scheme under which the elderly use public transport for just HK$2 per ride, from 65 to 60, at a projected annual cost of HK$1.7 billion. There will also be housing subsidies for people who have waited for a public flat for more than three years, while – in another change of direction – tenancy controls will come in for subdivided units. Lam was understood to have worked on the 10-measure package without consulting her cabinet, whose members were only briefed on them at an Executive Council meeting hours before they were announced. And nor was the Welfare Bureau involved, according to a source, who described the policies as “all being top-down”. The announcement came days after Lam met Beijing’s new envoy to Hong Kong, Luo Huining, who asked her to redouble her efforts to improve the economy and people’s livelihoods, among other things. Outlining the package at a press conference on Tuesday, Lam said the latest proposals aimed to ease the hardships of the poor, though defending her administration’s prior record on poverty by citing an increase in social welfare spending from HK$65.3 billion in 2017 to HK$84.3 billion in 2019-20.   There will also be housing subsidies for those who have waited for a public flat for more than three years. I am sure you will be able to find our previous different positions on some of these measures, from expressing reservations to perhaps resisting proposals or aspirations from the political parties or members of the public. But we are having a sort of breakthrough in our thinking that we should be listening more to the people Chief Executive Carrie Lam The government had previously opposed that policy, as well as resisting calls to lower the age threshold for the travel scheme by citing financial implications.  Acknowledging the U-turns, Lam said: “I am sure you will be able to find our previous different positions on some of these measures, from expressing reservations to perhaps resisting proposals or aspirations from the political parties or members of the public.  “But we are having a sort of breakthrough in our thinking that we should be listening more to the people.” Economists take aim at Carrie Lam’s ‘redundant’ relief measures 15 Jan 2020 Economists take aim at Carrie Lam’s ‘redundant’ relief measures 15 Jan 2020 However, she said demands by anti-government protesters, including an amnesty for those arrested over the last seven months of unrest, would not be met with the same flexibility. “Any political demand that violates the rule of law will not be accepted by us,” she reiterated.    Other major measures announced on Tuesday included a gradual increase in the number of statutory holidays to 17, benefiting blue-collar workers who only get 12 public holidays off each year, while white-collar workers generally get more. The city has 17 public holidays a year, but only 12 of those are currently statutory, meaning employers can choose not to give their staff the day off on the other five. There will also be cash allowances for up to three months to low-income workers who lose their jobs or are underemployed. And workers who do not earn enough to pay into their Mandatory Provident Fund savings – the threshold is currently HK$7,100 a month – will get contributions to their accounts from the government. Hong Kong lawyers group offers Lam protest inquiry road map 14 Jan 2020 Hong Kong lawyers group offers Lam protest inquiry road map 14 Jan 2020 “It’s a very preliminary estimate, but the new measures on livelihood issues this time are expected to invest HK$10 billion recurrent expenditure,” she said. “More than 1 million people will benefit.” She said some of the measures would have been touched on in her policy address last October, had the recent unrest not been dominating the administration’s agenda. But the city chief insisted the measures were not intended to placate anti-government protesters, or to boost support for the pro-establishment camp, some of whose members had previously floated some of the proposals in her package. The opposition Civic Party dismissed the relief package as a “two-dollar painkiller” that would not solve the political crisis. But political observer Chan Wai-keung, from the Hong Kong Community College of Polytechnic University, believed the measures could help boost support for the pro-government camp ahead of legislative elections in September. “The camp suffered a humiliating defeat in the district council elections. One observation was that they were losing support even in some so-called grass-roots districts. They need to consolidate their support base. That can explain why the measures mainly aim at helping the elderly, and lower-income groups, but leave out the middle class, which is seen as more pro-pan-democrat.” Dozens detained by police after march against parallel traders in Hong Kong’s Sheung Shui Dozens detained by police after march against parallel traders in Hong Kong’s Sheung Shui The pro-government Business and Professionals Alliance said it was pleased the government had responded to its proposal of extending cheap travel to the over-60s.

It plans to pull the plug on analogue services by the end of this year. Additional reporting by Tony Cheung Additional reporting by Tony Cheung 	SCMP

She was responding to the idea floated by Adam Kwok Kai-fai, executive director of Sun Hung Kai Properties – Hong Kong’s biggest developer by market value, who argued it could ease cross-border tensions amid deepening divisions in a city hit by anti-government protests for more than seven months. anti-government protests In a report submitted to the annual session of the Guangdong Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which opened on Sunday, Kwok said the one-way permit scheme that allowed up to 150 mainlanders to come to settle in Hong Kong every day had been a “sore point”, fuelling cross-border tensions. He proposed a three-year pilot scheme to halve the quota to 75, given it had not been filled for the past three years. But speaking on Tuesday ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lam rejected the idea, saying it was necessary to maintain the quota as one-third of marriages in the city were cross-border relationships. Meet the mainland Chinese who are living in fear in Hong Kong 8 Oct 2019 Meet the mainland Chinese who are living in fear in Hong Kong 8 Oct 2019 “Changing the quota at this time will send out a signal that we have attributed a particular social problem to the one-way permit scheme, which is intended for family reunion,” she said. “This is not something we are considering now.” Lam said the scheme’s daily quota of 150 was within the remit of the mainland authorities, which had been vetting the applications according to actual needs.  She added it usually took four years for a mainlander to reunite with his or her Hong Kong spouse through the scheme. The chief executive also said most of the applicants wanted to reunite with their families, which should be regarded as a human right and freedom that society should respect. 17 Feb 2020 17 Feb 2020 In October, the Post reported that Lam had once considered slashing the quota of the one-way permit scheme in her policy address.

Since 2010, more than 447,000 mainlanders have entered Hong Kong with one-way permits. Meanwhile, Lam ducked the question whether barring Kenneth Roth, head of an international human rights group, from entering Hong Kong on Sunday was a political decision. barring Kenneth Roth On Monday, the Foreign Correspondents’ Club (FCC) expressed grave concern at the government’s move to bar Roth, who was due to hold a press conference at the club to release the rights group’s yearly report perceived to be critical of Beijing. “The FCC is concerned that the Hong Kong government is using the Immigration Department to act punitively against organisations and media representatives it does not agree with, which is a violation of the commitment to free expression and free speech in Hong Kong law,” it added.

Joe Wong Chi-cho said on Tuesday the proposal would allow the theme park to make money and reinvent itself as a top attraction. In a paper to the Legislative Council on Monday, the government outlined a HK$10.6 billion (US$1.4 billion) plan for the “strategic repositioning” of the city’s home-grown resort. home-grown resort HK$10.6 billion plan to bail out Hong Kong’s ailing Ocean Park 13 Jan 2020 HK$10.6 billion plan to bail out Hong Kong’s ailing Ocean Park 13 Jan 2020 The park said on Monday it would not be able to repay HK$2.3 billion in commercial loans within the next two years. It also borrowed HK$3.67 billion from the government to build two hotels and a water park, with the money due to be repaid in 2021.  The government also considered it necessary to release further funding to help the park transform into an adventure-themed resort by 2027, the document reads. During a radio programme on Tuesday, Wong twice dodged questions on whether the Hong Kong Island attraction would need more cash injections in the future.  Wong said the plan aimed to enable the park in Southern district to build up funds and continue upgrading facilities to maintain its competitiveness.  “It is not a short-term [measure] like applying a bandage to stop the bleeding,” Wong said. Wong noted the park offered free entrance to people aged 65 and above, and to Hong Kong ID card holders on their birthdays. “Let’s not strike off Ocean Park’s contribution to Hong Kong, especially for specific communities,” Wong said. “It is hard to find theme parks in the world that lets the elderly in for free.” The park’s entrance fees are HK$498 for those over 12 and HK$249 for people aged three to 11. Asked if he was confident the plan would have enough support from lawmakers, Wong said: “We will try our best, if people care for Ocean Park they should support [the plan].” The plan requires approval from Legco’s Finance Committee, which is dominated by pro-government legislators.

Lawmakers will discuss the plan during an economic development panel meeting next Monday. Meanwhile, the park also said it would scrap its dolphin show, an attraction animal rights activists had long criticised. A park spokeswoman said the marine mammals, including dolphins, would be moved to an exhibit at a new attraction called Explorer‘s Wharf scheduled to be ready in 2023-24. It would provide a multi-species environment tailor-made for marine mammals, and underwater viewing opportunities. The dolphin show would cease by the time the mammals moved to their new home. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said it was ready to help relocate the dolphins to an accredited coastal sanctuary. “Ocean Park’s decision to end its dolphin shows but to keep the animals as a tourist gimmick is a missed ethical and financial opportunity,” Peta vice-president Jason Baker said on Tuesday. “As long as dolphins at Ocean Park are still trapped in cramped tanks, they will continue to suffer.” 	SCMP

Adam Kwok Kai-fai, a member of the conference’s standing committee, also submitted a proposal which included the results of a survey Hong Kong young people’s attitudes to the Greater Bay Area plan.

Lee Wing-ho, 22, applied for a judicial review seeking that the High Court declare magistrates acted unlawfully in granting the warrants, and breached his constitutional right to freedom and privacy of communication. In a writ filed on Monday, Lee claimed the warrants were too general, effectively authorising “any police officer to search and seize the entire digital contents of [his] mobile phone … without any limitation or conditions whatsoever imposed”. “The magistrates have … failed to carry out the judicial gatekeeping function,” his writ read, adding that the subsequent police action to access the contents of his devices was an “oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action”. Lee was arrested for unlawful assembly on Nathan Road during an anti-government protest in Mong Kok on August 3 last year. Upon his arrest, officers seized property including his mobile phone and some digital storage cards. He did not find out warrants had been issued for police to access his devices until October 23, when his case was about to go to court. He also found out that the warrants would authorise police to enter an office at the force’s headquarters in Wan Chai where his devices were stored, along with about 50 phones and devices seized from other arrestees.  On November 26, the charges were withdrawn. In his writ, Lee argued: “This is a chilling threat at a very fundamental level. A search warrant obtained by the police to access objects inside a police building is an abuse of process, an artifice.” Top judge sets up task force to speed up dealing with protest cases 14 Jan 2020 Top judge sets up task force to speed up dealing with protest cases 14 Jan 2020 “The police officers were given unchecked power to sift, copy, save, and retain any information they wished throughout that period, including new messages and communications.”  Phone-related privacy concerns were raised last month after pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung, who was arrested in August over a protest in June, questioned whether police had abused their power to “hack” his password-protected phone after the prosecution in his case admitted instant messaging records as evidence. Wong said he had not given police the password.  Police later clarified that the procedure was conducted under a magistrate-issued search warrant. Anti-government protests have rocked Hong Kong for more than seven months. Initially sparked by an extradition bill, which has since been withdrawn, the movement has broadened into a push for greater democracy and police accountability.

Lee maintained a “digital forensic examination” of the devices would only be conducted after getting a search warrant from the court. “From June to November 2019, police processed 1,429 cases that involved mobile phones as evidence,” Lee told legislators at the meeting. “Among those cases, 3,721 mobile phones belonging to arrested persons or suspects were involved, and the relevant cases were all processed with search warrants issued by the court.” Neither the police nor the judiciary replied to requests for comment.

His speech at the annual ceremony gave a rare glimpse into his take on a range of topics, from anti-government protesters’ means of pressing for democracy to accusations from their opponents that the judiciary is dragging its feet on unrest-related prosecutions. on Monday Below are excerpts from the address given by Ma, who will retire in January 2021, after a tenure of more than a decade, which has coincided with periods of serious political unrest, including anti-government protests which have roiled the city since June. Chief justice opens legal year with pledge to uphold Hong Kong’s judicial independence Chief justice opens legal year with pledge to uphold Hong Kong’s judicial independence On criticisms of the court On criticisms of the court Many questions have been raised regarding the judiciary, many commentaries have been given as to the work of the courts and many views have been expressed regarding our judges. A lot of these have been fair, but unfortunately, some have proceeded on misconceptions and misunderstandings, and distort an objective and proper picture of the law and the legal system.  Some have even bordered on the unacceptable ... I have said on a number of occasions that everyone is entitled to express their views regarding the work of the courts and one cannot of course expect approval of the result in every case. However, when attacks are made against the integrity and impartiality of the courts, or against the soundness of the legal system, or personal and highly offensive attacks are made against judges based solely on the outcome of cases, something needs to be said to inform the community about the operation of the law. Dozens detained by police after march against parallel traders in Hong Kong’s Sheung Shui Dozens detained by police after march against parallel traders in Hong Kong’s Sheung Shui     But it is important to understand that the enjoyment of these rights has limits so as not to affect adversely to an unacceptable level the enjoyment by other members of their community of their rights and liberties. I have previously referred to this as a respect for other people’s rights.  Accordingly, we see clear limits in the law to the exercise of rights. The enjoyment or insistence on one’s rights does not, for example, provide any excuse to harm other people or their property, or to display acts of violence. Our criminal laws provide a ready example of just where these limits lie and when called upon, these criminal laws are enforced to their full and proper extent by the courts. ... Therefore, the enjoyment of rights and freedoms also carries with it responsibilities and it is simply not right to think that other people’s rights – or even the rights of the community as a whole – should somehow be regarded as less important than one’s own. This acceptance is a large part of what I call the concept of justice. On allegations of court delays On allegations of court delays Views have been expressed, sometimes even criticisms, along the lines that there appear to be delays in the handling by the courts of cases that come before them ... So far as the cases related to recent events are concerned, one must bear in mind the constitutional requirement of a fair trial. ... In the vast majority – and I stress the words “vast majority” – of cases related to recent events when they first go before the courts after arrests have been made and charges have been laid, the prosecution will request for time (often amounting to several weeks if not more) in order to gather evidence, obtain legal advice from the Department of Justice as to the appropriateness of the charge laid and then to decide the appropriate level of court to try the charge, whether the Magistrates’ Courts, the District Court or the Court of First Instance. At this stage, no pleas are taken and out of fairness to the prosecution, it will be allowed time to prepare its case. Once it has done so, all relevant prosecution materials will then be provided to the accused person who must also be afforded adequate time to consider and prepare his or her defence. When both the prosecution and the defence are more or less prepared, pleas are then taken and, if charges are contested, a trial date is fixed in the chosen level of court. As early a date for trial as is practicable is then given. New hope for Hong Kong protesters in Taiwan after Tsai election win 13 Jan 2020 New hope for Hong Kong protesters in Taiwan after Tsai election win 13 Jan 2020 On bail granting and sentencing On bail granting and sentencing Bail is normally to be granted unless some exceptions apply such as the risk of flight or the risk of witness-tampering. This is entirely consistent with the presumption of innocence. The approach of the courts is not to presume an accused guilty; constitutional principles mandate the opposite. Where persons are convicted of crimes, the question of sentencing then arises. This is also an exercise based on the application of legal principle applied to the circumstances of the individual case. It is not an arbitrary exercise. Legal principle in this context includes looking to the sentencing guidelines set by the courts, in particular the Court of Appeal and due recognition given to the factors of retribution, deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation. On new task force looking at the increased number of prosecutions On new task force looking at the increased number of prosecutions new task force In order to cope with the expected high volume of cases, the judiciary has made plans to deal with such cases (at whatever level of court) expeditiously. A task group has been set up for some time now to look into how best and how expeditiously our courts can cope with these cases. Relevant stakeholders will be consulted on suggested measures. These include proposals to sit extended hours. I must, however, emphasise that while expedition is desirable and we will do our best to achieve this, it is important to bear in mind the overall importance of a fair trial. On judges’ duties On judges’ duties The proper administration of justice depends on judges discharging the duties and responsibilities incumbent on them. This is often misunderstood. Judges do not have the duty to achieve a certain result in accordance with popular wishes, whether they be majority or minority wishes. However, they have to ensure that a fair trial takes place and to adhere strictly to the requirements of the law. This is critical to bear in mind. In the discharge of their responsibilities, judges look only to the letter of the law and to the spirit of the law, and nothing else. Political, economic or social considerations, as opposed to legal considerations, simply do not enter into the equation. If the courts have erred in their application of the law, then, as I have just mentioned, there is a system of appeals all the way up to the Court of Final Appeal. ... Included in the judicial oath is the theme of the independence of the judiciary. Article 85 of the Basic Law states that the courts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference. 	SCMP

Philip Dykes SC, chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association, said it would be an “incorrect understanding” of the rule of law otherwise. He was speaking at the opening of the legal year in City Hall in Central on Monday, and referred to the anti-government protests now into their eighth month. So far police have arrested about 7,000 people. Among protesters’ demands are amnesty for those detained. Top legal bodies outraged by High Court vandalism targeting judge 2 Jan 2020 Top legal bodies outraged by High Court vandalism targeting judge 2 Jan 2020 Dykes did not touch on this in his speech, but stressed he was not trying to influence any decision made by the justice secretary which, under the Basic Law – the city’s mini-constitution – should be “free from any interference”. “However, the Prosecution Code published by the Department of Justice reminds us that a decision to prosecute is not made just because police have enough evidence to go to court and secure a conviction,” Dykes added. The Prosecution Code published by the Department of Justice reminds us that a decision to prosecute is not made just because police have enough evidence Philip Dykes, Bar Association chairman “Public interest plays a part in the decision-making process too, so that individuals or some classes of cases will not end up in court, even though there is a strong case against them.” He said he appreciated that the idea would “appear odd and at variance with the rule of law which some think calls for a prosecution whenever the law appears to have been breached”, but added: “That is an incorrect understanding.”  “The prosecutor’s looking beyond the four corners of a charge sheet to other matters, both personal to the person charged ... is a part of the rule of law,” Dykes said, citing a 2006 ruling by the Court of Appeal that described the ability to look at the overall merits of a case. 14 Oct 2019 14 Oct 2019 Although Dykes said violence and people attacking and injuring others “cannot come within the exercise of the right of peaceful protest”, he noted that the thousands of people arrested came from all walks of life. “There will be a reckoning later this year for some,” he added.  “Some of these people now face serious charges which carry substantial terms of imprisonment. Many though have been charged with lesser public order offences, not involving violence or extreme vandalism.  “They are all of them, in the main, of good character. They are representative of a large section of Hong Kong society.” In his address, Dykes also urged fellow barristers to be prepared to help out in court when cases went to prosecution. “That may mean reminding some members who have not practised criminal law in a long time that they should brush up their skills and be prepared to help out in court so that fair trial rights, which apply to both the prosecution and defence, may not be jeopardised.” He also assured that barristers would not let “personal prejudices get in the way of providing representation to persons seeking to use their services”. “Barristers will continue to defend unpopular clients and causes not because they necessarily want to, but because it is their professional duty to do so.” The integrity of Hong Kong’s courts is under threat and must be protected 5 Jan 2020 The integrity of Hong Kong’s courts is under threat and must be protected 5 Jan 2020 Meanwhile, Melissa Pang, president of the Law Society of Hong Kong, stressed the importance of obedience of the law and mutual respect for each other’s rights. “With utmost respect, civil disobedience is no licence to commit arson, damage citizens’ properties and injure persons,” Pang said. “Lest it be forgotten that obedience of the law, safeguard of the law are not only our duties, but our core values, unless we want to resort to some medieval methods of dispute resolution, for example, trial by combat. “Every wilful disobedience of the law is an erosion on our rule of law. I do not subscribe to the view that the rule of law will not be affected if those who commit arson and injuries to persons are willing and would eventually pay the price by going to prison,” Pang said. “We must be guarded against the ironical trap of infringing others’ freedoms in the pursuit of our own,” she said. In her speech, Pang also stressed that “unfair and unfounded attacks [against judges] purely according to outcomes and political views cannot be tolerated”. “This is the time to tell the public that politically our judiciary is colour-blind,” she said, referring to the so-called yellow and blue camps, or pro-democracy and pro-establishment sides respectively amid the protest movement.

It would explore measures such as extending courts’ sitting hours, Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma Tao-li said, while the judiciary would consult relevant stakeholders, including the city’s two biggest lawyers’ groups, the Bar Association and Law Society. In a hard-hitting speech at the opening of the new legal year, the outgoing chief justice dismissed accusations that the courts had been tardy, stressing that while everyone was entitled to their opinion, there were many “misconceptions and misunderstandings” about court procedures. Some government supporters have accused the judiciary of dragging its feet in meting out punishment to protesters, with Hong Kong rocked by more than seven months of anti-government unrest, sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill. anti-government unrest extradition bill Chief justice opens legal year with pledge to uphold Hong Kong’s judicial independence Chief justice opens legal year with pledge to uphold Hong Kong’s judicial independence But Ma said many had overlooked the time it took – often weeks, if not longer – for prosecutors to bring charges. The guarantee of a fair trial, which required adequate time for the defence to prepare, was also important, he added. “A fair trial does not mean that there must be a conviction or an acquittal depending on one’s personal or political viewpoint; the outcome of a criminal trial depends on the evidence that is presented to the court,” Ma said.  As of January 2, the protests had led to 6,956 arrests and 1,051 prosecutions. Ma saw the need to step up the courts’ ability to deal with cases expeditiously. Legal test for warrants that let Hong Kong police search phones 14 Jan 2020 Legal test for warrants that let Hong Kong police search phones 14 Jan 2020 He expected the burden would land on courts of all levels, especially magistrates’ courts and the District Court. But he was not keen on suddenly appointing more judges. “We have to ensure the standard of the judiciary. One can’t say we simply appoint more [to the bench], we have to ensure the quality,” Ma said. The chief justice, who steps down next year when he reaches the retirement age of 65, also shared his views on the right to certain freedoms, saying that while they were guaranteed under the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution, they were not absolute.  “The enjoyment or insistence on one’s rights does not, for example, provide any excuse to harm other people or their property, or to display acts of violence,” he said. In recent months, Beijing has stepped up its rhetoric regarding local courts, asking them to help stop violence and, on one occasion, telling them they had no power to decide whether a local law complied with the Basic Law. But Ma sidestepped Beijing’s remark, saying judicial independence was enshrined in the Basic Law.  Asked about his personal feelings over the past few months, Ma said he sometimes felt unhappy when watching television. Also speaking at the ceremony was Bar Association chairman Philip Dykes, who urged the Department of Justice to take into consideration “public interest” when prosecutors decide whether to bring a case to court, instead of doing so based just on sufficient evidence to secure a conviction. Highlights from annual speech by Hong Kong’s top judge 13 Jan 2020 Highlights from annual speech by Hong Kong’s top judge 13 Jan 2020 “The prosecutor’s looking beyond the four corners of a charge sheet to other matters, both personal to the person charged … is a part of the rule of law,” Dykes said. He clarified in a later comment that the department could exercise its discretion not to prosecute those who might have committed non-violent crimes.   But Dykes said that, even with his suggestions, he expected many cases to still land in court. He said Ma had not yet approached him about the task force, but looked forward to hearing details about it. Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah reflected on what she described as a “state of turmoil” in Hong Kong last year. “When disarray such as unchecked acts of violence and vandalism prevails, it will be rule of mob, not rule of law,” she said. She cited a judge’s words when he recently granted an injunction order to restrain doxxing attacks and harassment against police. ‘Take public interest account on whether to bring cases to court 13 Jan 2020 ‘Take public interest account on whether to bring cases to court 13 Jan 2020 “Criminal activity does not cease to be criminal activity simply because the actor believes himself or herself to be acting for a particular, perhaps higher, cause,” she said. Cheng stressed that the department took its constitutional role to bring prosecutions free from interference seriously, adding all decisions were made after taking into account the available evidence, applicable laws and the principles set out in the Prosecution Code. She did not respond to questions about Dykes’ suggestions when she left. Nor did David Leung Cheuk-yin, the director of public prosecutions. One judge, who wished to remain anonymous, said the benches were short-handed and could barely cope with the amount of cases in recent months. He said that while it would be desirable to deal with cases in good time, it was of utmost importance to ensure a fair trial for all parties.

But she echoed the chief justice’s comment that rights were not absolute. Legal sector lawmaker Dennis Kwok said it was reasonable for the judiciary to speed up hearings and extend court hours for protest cases when necessary. He added Dykes was merely reminding the public that prosecutions must be made in the public interest, which was an essential element of the rule of law. 	SCMP

Campuses emerged as a new front in escalating violence between hard-core protesters and riot police in November, with universities including Polytechnic, City and Baptist blighted by tear gas and petrol bombs. Security officers stood guard and turnstiles were in operation on Monday at Hung Hom’s PolyU, which underwent more than a month of restoration work after a stand-off between police and radicals over nearly two weeks. Hong Kong's PolyU siege : From beginning to end Hong Kong's PolyU siege : From beginning to end Police laid siege to the campus for 13 days in November after anti-government protesters took over the campus, blocking roads, setting fires and breaking into on-site laboratories. anti-government protesters took over the campus PolyU said on Monday that most of the damage had been fixed, but parts of the campus including the swimming pool, some footbridges, and a section of the jogging track, which sits in the public area of the grounds, were still being repaired.  The university, which started to reopen from mid-December following the previous month’s chaos, added that carpets and ceilings in all affected buildings were either being replaced or had been sterilised. Its food court, which suffered sanitation issues after protesters used the area as a canteen during the siege, reopened on Monday morning after it was repeatedly sterilised and subjected to bacterial level tests. bacterial level tests. Many students and staff wore masks when returning to the campus. While some said they did so fearing the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, others were worried about toxicity levels after hundreds of rounds of tear gas were fired during the demonstrations.

I’m still worried there are toxic residues remaining after so many rounds of tear gas were fired.” PolyU said last month that independent laboratory testing of environmental samples collected on campus showed health and safety standards were being met. It said thorough cleaning had also been carried out, including of air handling system filters and portable water tanks.

Max Cheung, 20, from PolyU’s school of optometry, found them an inconvenience and unnecessary. “Many security guards have been standing by at entrances, which are already safe enough. What’s the point of making entry to the campus like passing through border customs?” the third-year student said.

A 26-year-old master’s student from mainland China, who identified herself as Ruby, believed the tough measures could be relaxed in the coming months. “PolyU used to adopt an open-to-public policy … I believe security could be loosened gradually in the future but it would have to be balanced against student safety,” she said. PolyU’s student union has collected 5,000 signatures in an online petition accusing the university of a lack consultation over the turnstiles installation.   In an email on Monday, PolyU president Teng Jin-guang appealed to students and staff to understand the need for the security measures as restoration work was still in progress. “The university will review these measures at appropriate junctures,” Teng said. “Let’s adhere to the principles of peace and rationality, embrace diverse cultures, accept different viewpoints and respect the rights of others.” He was also expected to meet students next month to listen to their views. Security measures at City University and Baptist University, both in Kowloon Tong, were also strengthened as they started their new term on Monday, with card-reading machines placed at main entrances to restrict access. card-reading machines placed at main entrances Most of the vandalised facilities at the two universities are back to normal with a few still closed for repair, including the footbridge linking City University student halls with the campus where protesters clashed with police.

A 23-year-old undergraduate from Guangdong, who only gave his surname as Yue, returned to Baptist University for the first time on Monday since the university arranged for students to retreat from the campus last November. “There are several security guards at entrance apart from staff. It makes me feel safe,” he said. “I got scared when I was leaving the campus last November. I saw many black clad people digging bricks and making petrol bombs on campus.” But Yue said he was applying to study in the US or Canada because his family was worried about his safety after the protests. “I plan to study elsewhere if situations in Hong Kong get worse. But if things are stable, I prefer to stay because otherwise I would need to study for one more year and that would be more costly,” he said. He said some mainland students had withdrawn from the university and returned home.

The revelation on Monday, which confirms an exclusive report by the Post last week, is aimed at transforming the park into an adventure-themed resort, grounded in nature and conservation by making use of its existing site and shoreline. exclusive report Post The expansion plan will create seven zones and 20 attractions over the next seven years. More than 10 existing popular attractions will be upgraded or re-themed, while some current ones will be demolished. The park warned at a press briefing that its coffers would dry up this year without any fresh capital amid an expected cash flow deficit of more than HK$600 million in the 2019/20 financial year. It also said it would not be able to repay HK$2.3 billion in commercial loans within the next two years. The park also owes the government HK$3.67 billion in loans which were used for financing the construction of two hotels and a water park, with the money to be repaid in 2021. Its cash balance will be depleted this year if it fails to obtain any extra funding.  The government hopes the transformation for Ocean Park will attract more visitors and bring in sufficient revenue to sustain future operations. Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau Tang-wah said the HK$10.6 billion injection showed the government’s commitment to invest in tourism infrastructure and help the park ease its financial burden.  “We want to help the park ride out this financial storm,” he added. “We also need to invest in the future.” Ocean Park in pay freeze as visitor numbers slump amid Hong Kong protests 3 Jan 2020 Ocean Park in pay freeze as visitor numbers slump amid Hong Kong protests 3 Jan 2020 The park blamed its performance on the civil unrest in the second half of 2019, sparked last June by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. The park said the movement, which has morphed into wider anti-government protests, led to an “unprecedented steep decline” in visitors of more 30 per cent to 1.9 million between July and December year on year.  It added that if the trend continued, attendance would drop by more than 40 per cent to 3.3 million in the financial year ending this June. More than 40 jurisdictions overseas issued travel alerts or warnings for those coming to Hong Kong, as the protests roll into their eighth month, with no signs of abating. Upon completion of the expansion, the park expects attendance to rise gradually to 5 million people in the financial year 2022/23, and to 7.5 million in 2027/28. One of its best years was in 2013/14 with 7.6 million arrivals. Ocean Park chairman Leo Kung Lin-cheng appealed for public support, saying he was confident that the new development would successfully transform the place and deliver a refreshing and enjoyable experience for visitors. “We don’t want a lot of people to come to the park. We want quality customers who can make the atmosphere better for everyone. When they are happy, I hope they will bring some merchandise home,” he said. “We really do have Hong Kong people in our hearts. It’s a park for Hongkongers, no matter what’s your political view. We want your support. “If you don’t love us, if you don’t want us, there’s no place for Ocean Park in Hong Kong.” Typhoon, unrest double whammy as Ocean Park deficit hits US$72 million 11 Dec 2019 Typhoon, unrest double whammy as Ocean Park deficit hits US$72 million 11 Dec 2019 Under the plan, seven themed zones will be created based on the area’s waterfront design. For example, a new section called Azure Bay will sport a pier for visitors to board ferry services to a new promenade at Deep Water Bay and Tai Shue Wan. Passengers can enjoy the coastal scenery of Southern district en route. We want quality customers who can make the atmosphere better for everyone ... If you don’t love us, there’s no place for Ocean Park in Hong Kong Leo Kung, Ocean Park chairman The park plans to steer away from conventional animal shows and will focus on its animal exhibits and displays on environmental protection, marine conservation and education. A dozen facilities will be torn down, including the signature Ocean Theatre that hosts dolphin and sea lion shows daily. The animals would be transported to another area. Yau said the upgrade was expected to bring in HK$43.8 billion and create 11,100 jobs in 10 years. Ocean Park to launch HK$100 million light show amid tourism downturn 10 Jan 2020 Ocean Park to launch HK$100 million light show amid tourism downturn 10 Jan 2020 Ocean Park is one of two theme parks in the city, with the other being Hong Kong Disneyland Resort on Lantau Island. The 43-year-old park is located in the south of Hong Kong Island, and at one stage received donations from the Hong Kong Jockey Club. It operates as a non-profit organisation and on a site provided for free by the government, which appoints its board members. The Hong Kong Tour Guides General Union, which counts nearly 3,000 or 43 per cent of the city’s tour guides as members, said it welcomed the plan. “If you go to Chimelong theme park [in Hengqin] for example, I don’t think you will ever want to come to Ocean Park,” union chairman Wong Ka-ngai said, pointing out that the latter was outdated. “But the spending must produce a sustainable impact and be on a value-for-money basis.” Hong Kong Tourism Board chairman Pang Yiu-kai also expressed support for the plan, saying it would raise Hong Kong’s attractiveness. However, pro-democracy lawmaker Jeremy Tam Man-ho from Civic Party said his group would throw out the expansion plan. “Even when tourist arrivals reached a record high in 2018, Ocean Park did badly and lost money. How can we trust the existing management? ” he argued. Tam suggested that the government let the park prioritise resolving its financial woes by allowing it to suspend the repayment of loans and interest for five years. He added that the government should reshuffle park management and its board of directors to let in new blood and map out a blueprint for future development. 	SCMP

US-China trade war But in a bid to reassure delegates, who included leading finance experts, she said the city was withstanding the pressure and the divisions in society would be resolved. “If we cannot direct the wind, we can surely adjust our sails,” Lam said at the opening of the two-day forum in Wan Chai, which is attended by thousands of global investors and policymakers. She added the “strengths and resilience” of the city’s financial systems “have not been undermined despite [the fact] we have experienced considerable unrest and challenges in recent months”. ADVERTISING “Through the concerted efforts of the government and the people of Hong Kong, I am confident that we will bridge our divide,” Lam said. The annual forum, co-organised by the Hong Kong government and the Trade Development Council, gathered more than 100 financial experts to examine the global economic landscape in forums and panel discussions at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. Beijing’s new envoy to Hong Kong leader: step up efforts against unrest 10 Jan 2020 Beijing’s new envoy to Hong Kong leader: step up efforts against unrest 10 Jan 2020 At one of the plenary sessions at the forum, hundreds of participants were asked to vote on what would be the major challenge for global growth this year.  Thirty-nine per cent chose trade tensions between China and the United States, while 34 per cent saw intensifying geopolitical risks as the biggest obstacle. Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos Lam said amid “large and alarming” geopolitical concerns, the administration appreciated the city’s unique role in fast-growing Asia, and had been “busy making the most of Hong Kong’s manifold advantages” and forging connections between businesses, investors and financial markets.  She added Asian economies would this year surpass the rest of the world combined for the first time in purchasing power, which she described as “a quantum leap” on a few decades ago. The embattled chief executive said financial technology would remain as one of the high priority sectors. Last year the government issued eight virtual banking licences and two virtual insurer licences, Lam added, while an instant payment system launched in 2018 now handled transactions totalling HK$2,385 million (US$307 milion) every day. The protests started in June with a peaceful mass rally against the now-withdrawn extradition bill, but have escalated into a wider anti-government movement fuelled by allegations of police brutality and the campaign for more democracy, with hard-core elements resorting to violence. protests extradition bill Fourth round of relief measures for Hong Kong economy battered by unrest 3 Dec 2019 Fourth round of relief measures for Hong Kong economy battered by unrest 3 Dec 2019 Despite Lam’s reassurances, Mohamed Hasan, business development manager of India-based company Transvision Shipping, said it would not be easy to rebuild business confidence dampened by the months long anti-government protests, especially with their business partners in mainland China, who had been reluctant to visit the company’s Hong Kong office. He said: “Until last week, our Chinese agents would still rather go to Macau or Shenzhen but not Hong Kong for meetings. They don’t feel safe here. “How can we make our business flourish even when transport can sometimes be a problem [when protests take place]?” he said, adding he hoped the government would provide constructive political solutions to end the turmoil.   Saliba Sassine, managing director of BlueMount Capital, an Australian company which provides advisory services to Chinese companies, said while Hong Kong’s political unrest triggered anxiety in many sectors, he remained positive for the city’s important role in connecting them to mainland investors. Sassine said the protests were an ""internal matter and would become manageable, adding: ""We will have to be patient. We still count on Hong Kong to connect us to the huge China market in long run.” "	SCMP

Tsai, from the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), comfortably beat her main challenger Han Kuo-yu, from the mainland China-friendly Kuomintang, in Saturday’s election – billed as a referendum on the island’s relations with Beijing. comfortably beat Han Kuo-yu “I was a bit nervous before election day, seeing apathetic students around and the massive turnout of Han’s campaign rally,” a 21-year-old student named Sing said. “Had Han been elected, I was afraid I would fail to secure a visa and have to move to somewhere in Europe or the United States. I don’t want to start all over again. “Now, I feel relieved and more certain about the future. I hope I can focus on finishing my degree here.” With Hong Kong’s anti-government movement rolling on for more than seven months, an estimated 200 protesters had fled to the island on extended tourist visas. The Chi-Nan Presbyterian Church in Taipei, which has offered humanitarian help to about 200, believed at least 30 were now staying on the island. While Sing managed to get tentatively enrolled in a local university, other adults were unable to work, including a 30-year-old protester who gave his name as Nick. anti-government movement Taiwan president meets US and Japan envoys in wake of victory 17 Feb 2020 Taiwan president meets US and Japan envoys in wake of victory 17 Feb 2020 “I am basically a nobody here – I cannot do what I want and I cannot even work,” Nick, who had a job in the catering industry in Hong Kong, said. “The first thing I hope is that Tsai can give me a work visa so that I can stand on my own two feet.”  Both Sing and Nick were among the first group to arrive in Taiwan, having been involved in the storming of Hong Kong’s legislature on July 1. storming of Hong Kong’s legislature Beijing and Hong Kong protesters react to Tsai Ing-wen’s win in Taiwan presidential election Beijing and Hong Kong protesters react to Tsai Ing-wen’s win in Taiwan presidential election  “I know I have been targeted by police. I don’t want to be a deserter, but it is not worth being arrested at the airport and sent to prison for at least six years for rioting,” he said.  A life away from home, with no return date, is not easy. With so much free time, Nick said he had closely followed all the demonstrations in Hong Kong, consumed by a sense of guilt knowing protesters as young as 13 had been arrested. Sing, who has been catching up with his studies at university, has deliberately distanced himself from other students from Hong Kong, for fear of his background being discovered.  “I feel under pressure when I have to do group projects as well, as I am still not sure if I can stay here for the long term,” he said. Hong Kong protesters in Taiwan celebrate election result, stage demonstration 12 Jan 2020 Hong Kong protesters in Taiwan celebrate election result, stage demonstration 12 Jan 2020 Tsai and the DPP have said repeatedly they will do all they can to help protesters seeking shelter in Taiwan. Last month, she said there was no need for Taiwan to institute a refugee law, as existing regulations governing the island’s relations with Hong Kong and Macau were sufficient to deal with the issue. I don’t want to be a deserter, but it is not worth being arrested at the airport and sent to prison for at least six years for rioting Nick, Hong Kong protester Hong Kong lawyer Daniel Wong Kwok-tung, who is in talks on the visa status of these protesters, said they had high expectations for Tsai’s government. “As the DPP has fought against dictatorship since its establishment in the 1980s, they should understand our agony and sadness in watching our comrades being arrested,” he said. He is opening a restaurant in Taipei, which will be operated by the protesters. Huang Yibee, chief executive of human rights pressure group Covenants Watch in Taipei, believed Tsai’s government would relax the restrictions for Hongkongers to enrol in schools and work as ways for them to gain permanent residence, all under the current law. Her organisation, linking up with other local NGOs, has been offering internship programmes for Hong Kong protesters in need. “But it will be very difficult for the government to establish a new mechanism, or invoke Article 18 in the process,” she said, referring to a law that promises help to Hong Kong and Macau citizens “whose safety and liberty are immediately threatened for political reasons”. “After all, Tsai has to balance different factors in the national interest. Avoiding provoking Beijing is surely in the equation,” Huang said, adding that there were different voices in society, with some worrying about a flood of refugees from Hong Kong. “Other local groups that support Taiwan independence do not want to walk too closely with Hong Kong, which is part of China.” 	SCMP

The agreement was made at a meeting between Luo Huining and the province’s leadership, which came after the new liaison office chief held talks with Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, her predecessors Tung Chee-hwa and Leung Chun-ying, as well as top officials in Shenzhen last week. Luo replaced Wang Zhimin as director of the central government’s liaison office in Hong Kong in a surprise move unveiled on January 4. In a statement posted on the liaison office’s website, it was revealed Luo met Guangdong’s top leaders – including party chief Li Xi, governor Ma Xingrui and deputy governor Zhang Xin – in Guangzhou on Sunday. “Both sides pledged to insist on … implementing the ‘one country, two systems’ principle comprehensively and accurately, and work together to push forward the Greater Bay Area project,” the statement read, in a reference to Beijing’s ambitious plan to turn Hong Kong, Macau, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and seven other cities in Guangdong into an innovation and financial powerhouse to rival Silicon Valley.  Luo and the Guangdong chiefs also agreed to further strengthen ties between the southern Chinese province and Hong Kong in areas such as trade and entrepreneurship.

In subsequent, separate meetings with Tung and Leung, who are also vice-chairmen of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the nation’s top advisory body, Luo discussed city’s situation with them and praised the political grandees for their “historic contribution” following Hong Kong’s return to China from British rule in 1997.   In his meeting with Leung, Luo also explored with the former leader ways of stabilising the situation and getting Hong Kong back on track, while in Luo’s meeting with Tung, they talked about how to resolve deep-rooted problems in the city. Luo and Shenzhen leaders met last week to discuss the crisis in Hong Kong and understand more about the region. Protests triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill have gripped the city since June last year. extradition bill Radical elements of the movement, which has developed into a wider anti-government campaign, have vandalised and started fires at railway stations and universities, while also targeting businesses with links to mainland China and setting roadblocks on major thoroughfares.

Post As it stands, the measure is voluntarily but some employees are being encouraged to take up to a month of no-pay leave, with Cathay Dragon pilots among the first. The move is partly a reaction to reduced flight schedules in the year ahead, an adjustment for continued tepid demand, requiring the airline to be more disciplined on costs to manage the shortfall in expected ticket sales. A companywide review assessing personnel needs was set to conclude soon, according to people familiar with the matter. No job cuts are thought to be planned. A Cathay Pacific spokeswoman stressed no compulsory unpaid leave was being planned for any of its 27,000 employees. Cathay Pacific “There are existing voluntary ‘lifestyle rosters’ in place for Cathay Dragon flight crew. Such rosters are open to application and allow crew to pursue interests of their choice while maintaining a balanced and rewarding lifestyle,” the spokeswoman said.  CEO Augustus Tang Kin-wing said last November that cost control measures were to be unveiled which would be “proportionate to the challenges we face”. Cabin crew and pilots in particular are set to fly less as the airline cuts back its flight schedules in 2020 as the overall impact of the citywide protests has seen the airline hit by fewer bookings. Cathay staff leaving in new round of employee exits at protest-hit airline 19 Dec 2019 Cathay staff leaving in new round of employee exits at protest-hit airline 19 Dec 2019 Hong Kong’s flagship carrier said it would shrink capacity by 1.4 per cent in 2020 – the first contraction since 2013 – reversing an earlier plan to grow by 3.1 per cent.  The airline previously offered unpaid leave, which was voluntary, in 2008, following the global financial meltdown, in 2003, during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak, and after the downturn in air travel caused by the events of September 11, 2001.   The airline said it was still making adjustments to its schedules and therefore they were not reflected in full when passengers presently booked flights for the JFK route. In recent months, Cathay deferred delivery of new aircraft this year and planned to accelerate the retirement of older planes, froze hiring of non-essential staff, deferred non-critical spending and scrapped its annual 13th month companywide bonus. Last year, the airline issued two profit warnings. The airline, which unveils its 2019 financial results in March, expects the second half of last year to be “significantly below” the first six months – when it earned HK$1.34 billion (US$171.8 million). Troubled rival Hong Kong Airlines, which narrowly avoided closure at the end of last year through a cash bailout, already offers the bulk of staff two days a month of unpaid leave and four days for managers. Executives were also required to take a 20 per cent pay cut. Hong Kong Airlines Hong Kong Airlines crisis shows city must change policy, says Qantas boss 28 Dec 2019 Hong Kong Airlines crisis shows city must change policy, says Qantas boss 28 Dec 2019 Tourist arrivals into Hong Kong for November, the most recent figures, fell by the most in 16 years – by 55.9 per cent. There have been double-digit falls in visitor numbers since August. Nevertheless, Cathay remains in a better financial position than its distressed hometown rival. To shore up its collapsing customer base with transit passengers Cathay has been cutting its fares. It has also filled up planes by giving away economy class travel to its employees for almost nothing. Staffing costs made up 18.5 per cent of the airline’s total HK$109.5 billion expenditure in 2018, an expense next only to fuel payments. Morningstar equity analyst Ivan Su said the airline had successfully implemented unpaid leave previously to help it get back on a more stable footing. “I believe the offering of voluntarily unpaid leave will help Cathay to manage its resources better, reducing some operating costs in a time of weak demand,” he said. Luya You, transport analyst at brokerage Bocom International, said: “Given the size of that cost segment for Cathay, it would still be welcomed if staff costs were to decrease. It makes sense given their capacity plans for 2020. There very likely needs to be adjustments in staff levels for the year ahead. I think they’re probably trying to ease into changes with this move.” Under pressure from Beijing to rein in staff taking part in unauthorised protests, Cathay was rocked by resignations and reshuffles among its senior management. Severe scrutiny by the Civil Aviation Administration of China prompted mainland passengers and businesses to boycott Hong Kong’s premium airline. 	SCMP

In a vibrant arts workshop in Hung Hom, dozens of young people, some masked, are hunched over tables hard at work. On one wall, a large mural shows a crowd of masked and helmeted protesters dressed in black.   The young men and women in their teens and 20s are in good spirits, chatting as they turn out handmade cookies, mini fa pai – floral decorative plaques – key chains, drawings and coasters. fa pai Many of the works carry slogans like “Five demands, not one less”, “Free Hong Kong”, “Revolution of our times” or images related to the anti-government protests which have rocked the city for more than seven months. Everyone present is paid HK$60 an hour to attend the vocational classes organised by pro-democracy restaurant owner Cheung Chun-kit, 40, as part of what he calls the “economic circle of conscience”. He came up with the idea of providing vocational training to help young people affected by the ongoing social unrest to equip themselves with skills and become financially independent.  Cheung, who runs the Lung Mun Cafe chain of restaurants, said: “Because of this unrest, many young people have become jobless, penniless, ‘school-less’ or even homeless, as some have even been evicted by their families. “I want to make them feel that they can still find hope in their lives.” Using more than HK$1 million of his own money, he launched more than 20 free classes in December alone, with the help of volunteer instructors for hairdressing, beautician training, leather craft, as well as making cookies and mini fa pai. fa pai    Cheung said so far, more than 10 had gone on to land jobs as hairdressers, while 40 found work baking cookies, and 30, making mini fa pai. fa pai Growing a ‘yellow economic force’ Growing a ‘yellow economic force’ Cheung’s “conscience” enterprise takes off from an ongoing campaign by anti-government protesters – so-called “yellow ribbons” – to support businesses that back them, while shunning those that are considered pro-government, pro-Beijing or pro-police. For several months now, they have branded some shops and restaurants “yellow” for supporting the movement, with mobile applications sprouting to provide lists of “yellow” business to patronise and “blue” establishments to boycott for supporting the authorities.   Well-known “yellow” eateries include Cheung’s restaurant chain, as well as the JarGor 1996 snack chain, which often sports long queues of customers, especially young people. On the other hand, restaurants branded “blue”, such as those owned by the Maxim’s group, Best Mart 360 and Japanese fast food chain Yoshinoya, have had their premises vandalised, torched or covered in graffiti. Hong Kong restaurants branded ‘yellow’ if they support protests, ‘blue’ if they don’t 2 Nov 2019 Hong Kong restaurants branded ‘yellow’ if they support protests, ‘blue’ if they don’t 2 Nov 2019 The pro-Beijing Fulum Group, which owns 78 restaurants, posted a net loss of HK$63.8 million for the half year until the end of September last year, compared with its net profit of HK$12.7 million over the same period the previous year. The “blue” Hunghom Cafe chain was hit so hard, it was reported last November to be seeking new tenants to take over its six premises. Hunghom Cafe chain was hit so hard, it was reported last November to be seeking new tenants to take over its six premises. The anti-government movement hopes to grow the “yellow economic force”, uniting businesses that support it. “The yellow economic concept is heading in the right direction by boycotting the blue shops. This will lead to yellow shops making more money and opening more shops,” Cheung says. However, he insists that his “economic circle of conscience” is aimed at creating a better future for younger Hongkongers in the wake of the unrest. By the end of last year, about 6,500 people have been arrested since protests began last June, some as young as 12. Those who are eventually dealt with, especially for rioting, face jail terms and an uncertain future. Even if they are acquitted, they may still lose their jobs and places in school, or find it hard to get hired. Cheung hopes to set up a foundation to make his “economic circle of conscience” sustainable, with the primary goal of ensuring jobs for those who need them. Protests have changed city’s dating game over mismatch of ‘yellow’ and ‘blue’ 6 Jan 2020 Protests have changed city’s dating game over mismatch of ‘yellow’ and ‘blue’ 6 Jan 2020 He has been looking for business partners to offer free training, and also hopes to attract university professors and professionals such as lawyers and accountants to run classes for young people. “This has nothing to do with changing the economic landscape of Hong Kong,” he said. “I am only concerned about the long-term future of these youngsters. We should think about the next 10 or 20 years. Some may be locked up in prison for a long time and how they or their families can survive will be an issue.” I am only concerned about the long-term future of these youngsters ... Some may be locked up in prison for a long time Cheung Chun-kit, owner, Lung Mun Cafe chain Chan Sing, 44, the boss of Chan Sing Workshop, a mini fa pai production firm, is among a handful of “yellow” businesses that have joined Cheung in his efforts. fa pai After his 19-year-old son was arrested last July over the protests, Chan declared on Facebook that he would refuse orders from police. Business dropped, and was hit further by the economic downturn. Chan said there was a point when it looked like he might have to shut down. But over the past month, he has received a flood of orders from “yellow” clients after he joined Cheung and began holding free classes to teach youngsters how to make mini fa pai. fa pai. Businesses caught in crossfire of protest, as new apps make politics part of shopping 12 Aug 2019 Businesses caught in crossfire of protest, as new apps make politics part of shopping 12 Aug 2019 ‘Stupid’ to divide economy by politics ‘Stupid’ to divide economy by politics Although Cheung and Chan say they are concerned mainly with helping young people, the “conscience” effort is seen to fit in with the “yellow economic concept” dividing businesses into yellow or blue groups. This has sparked an ongoing debate over what it means for Hong Kong businesses to be split this way and the effect on society. Simon Lee Siu-po, co-director of the international business and Chinese enterprise programme at Chinese University, says much depends on whether businesses in the “yellow economic circle” can provide quality goods and services. “Using one’s own political stance to attract business may only work for a short term,” he said. “In the long term, if firms fail to keep their customers happy with their goods or service, they may go. A successful business can never only depend on a political slogan.” A successful business can never only depend on a political slogan Simon Lee, programme co-director, CUHK For the “yellow economic circle” to succeed, he said, “yellow” shops must unite in making long-term strategies, avoid vicious competition with one another and form alliances. “If this is just some loosely-organised circle of individual firms without a common goal, it won’t have any impact on the city’s economy,” he said. Lee said it was not impossible for a yellow economic force to break the market dominance of pro-Beijing firms in Hong Kong. “If yellow firms are united and dedicated to cultivating like-minded younger people through employment, vocational training and partnerships, they will have more bargaining power to counteract the blue camp’s economic dominance,” he said. Businesses affected by protest damage file up to HK$600 million in insurance claims 28 Oct 2019 Businesses affected by protest damage file up to HK$600 million in insurance claims 28 Oct 2019 Others have poured cold water on the idea of a “yellow economic circle” gaining influence. Billy Mak Sui-choi, associate professor of finance and decision sciences at Baptist University, dismissed it as “unworkable” and “stupid”. “To maximise profits, a business should attract a broader base of customers. To target a particular group of customers based on political considerations will only limit your customer base and eventually restrict business growth,” he said. As for the yellow group’s strong anti-Beijing stance, he asked: “How can a firm entirely cut ties from the mainland and refrain from using any mainland materials?” How can a firm entirely cut ties from the mainland and refrain from using any mainland materials? Billy Mak, associate professor, Baptist University That was a point also made by former chief executive Leung Chun-ying, who underlined the close links between Hong Kong businesses and the mainland in a social media post. He wondered how the so-called “yellow economy” could completely sever ties with the mainland especially when most local firms relied on the import of raw materials from the mainland. Noting that even water has to be imported from the Dongjiang in Guangdong, he added sarcastically: “French mineral water can, of course, be used for taking a bath or washing the toilet. But it’s a bit expensive.” Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau Tang-wah argued that no economy can draw a line to decide who to include or exclude. He called for reconciliation of shoppers and diners with different political views, saying Hong Kong’s competitiveness came from its free and open economy. “Hong Kong must move on, so we have a campaign called ‘Hong Kong is On’,” he told the Post in December. Post “I am not interested in the colour of economic circles you are in, there is a major division already. Should a family go dining in two restaurants? How can we reconcile if the situation goes on?” Economist Andy Kwan Cheuk-chiu, director of ACE Centre for Business and Economic Research, said there must be some firms pretending to be “yellow” to cash in on protest trends. However, he said “yellow” customers were all very savvy and would be able to tell the fake ones from those who really supported the movement. “They have some criteria for these yellow firms, such as a track record of taking part in citywide strikes, giving freebies or donations to protesters, or having a ‘Lennon Wall’,” he said. Kwan said only certain sectors such as dining, retail, advertising and marketing, as well as IT would be able to sustain “yellow” practices as these had individual firms. “But for Hong Kong’s four key industries – finance, tourism, trading and logistics – it’s very hard for the yellow economic circle to even make an entry. The sectors are all dominated by corporate clients and most of the firms have ties with the mainland. “It’s impossible for such trends to have an impact on the overall economy,” he said, adding it was more of an ideology than a changing economic landscape. Paying the price for being ‘blue’ Paying the price for being ‘blue’ On the ground, even small businesses have had a hard time after being branded “blue”. Not only have “yellow ribbons” and their supporters boycotted these establishments, they have also made numerous complaints against the shops to different government departments, such as the fire services, health authorities, and the lands and highways departments. The Ngan Loong Cafe in Lei Yue Mun and Friendly Tasty restaurant in Tai Po, saw their fortunes change overnight after the owners expressed support for police. Kate Lee Hoi-wu, 51, a single mother who runs Ngan Loong Cafe, became the target of online abuse and repeated complaints to the authorities after she put up signs in her restaurant backing police late last June. “For the first three weeks, I had very few customers. There was a day when I earned only HK$80,” she recalled, saying she chalked up debts of “several tens of thousands of dollars”. In a dramatic turn, business began picking up in late July, after some officers, including new police commissioner Chris Tang Ping-keung, came to her shop and thanked her for her support. Following that, some “blue ribbons” and mainland tourists started coming to the restaurant, and some even volunteered to help her run the place. “Now my restaurant is full of customers. I can tell you business has never been so good,” she said, adding that she was still trying to repay her debts. The experience has left her firmly against the notion of colour-coding the economy. “This will only sow further discord in society,” she said. Widow and single mother-of-two Wong Lee-lee, 38, who runs the Friendly Tasty restaurant serving rice noodle rolls and traditional desserts, paid the price for saying on Facebook last June that she supported police.   The online abuse came flooding in, her shop was branded “blue” and people called for a boycott. Her business suffered and is still struggling, according to her. She said that she has had to dip into her savings to make ends meet. While Wong insisted she did not regret stating her view, she was against dividing Hong Kong businesses into yellow and blue economic circles. “I don’t care about this kind of labelling,” she said. “I welcome all sorts of customers, yellow or blue. I woo customers with my food and service. That’s all.” Additional reporting by Denise Tsang Additional reporting by Denise Tsang 	SCMP

Kenneth Roth, the group’s executive director and an American citizen, returned to the United States after Hong Kong immigration authorities turned him away at the city's international airport on Sunday without explanation, according to the organisation. He had planned to visit the city to launch the New York-based group’s “World Report 2020”, which includes a lead essay on the Chinese government’s “assault” on the international human rights system. Hong Kong immigration denies entry to Human Rights Watch executive director Hong Kong immigration denies entry to Human Rights Watch executive director An Immigration Department spokeswoman said it would not comment on individual cases. She added that when handling cases, the department would, in accordance with the laws and immigration policies, fully consider all relevant factors and circumstances of the case before deciding whether the entry should be allowed or not.  Roth said: “I had hoped to spotlight Beijing’s deepening assault on international efforts to uphold human rights. The refusal to let me enter Hong Kong vividly illustrates the problem.” Roth, who had flown in from New York, later wrote on Twitter: “Despite my probing, the Hong Kong immigration authorities would say only (and repeatedly) that they were barring me for ‘immigration reasons’. They wouldn’t even own up to the real reason.”  “It's sad and troubling how quickly things have deteriorated under pressure from Beijing,” he added.  “Trying to silence the human rights messenger shows a determination to flout, not uphold, human rights standards.” China-US ties ‘dogged by lies, fake news and capitalist dogma’ 17 Feb 2020 China-US ties ‘dogged by lies, fake news and capitalist dogma’ 17 Feb 2020 The group was expected to release its 652-page report at a news conference in Hong Kong on Wednesday. The report reviews human rights practices in nearly 100 countries. Roth’s essay says the Chinese government is undermining the global system for enforcing human rights. On his return to the US on Monday, Roth revealed he would launch the report at a news conference at the United Nations in New York on Tuesday “given that the authorities blocked me from entering Hong Kong.” On December 2, Beijing’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the Chinese government would impose sanctions against Human Rights Watch and four other US-based non-profit groups that “played an egregious role” in the disturbances in Hong Kong, in its response to Washington’s endorsement of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which could pave the way for diplomatic action and economic sanctions against the city’s government.

Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch co-wrote an open letter to Lam, urging her to set up an independent commission of inquiry to investigate alleged excessive use of force by police in the more than seven months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong. anti-government protests “An independent commission of inquiry is the first step to addressing the serious human rights violations against protesters since June,” said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. The European Union also weighed in on the controversy. In a statement, European Commission spokeswoman Virginie Battu-Henriksson said denying entry to Roth “raises serious questions over Hong Kong’s traditions of openness and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression”. “These principles are enshrined in the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights,” Battu-Henriksson said. “These principles are an integral part of Hong Kong's continuing success and we expect them to be upheld.” 	SCMP

The demonstration took place at Edinburgh Place in Central a day after Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen won re-election for a second term in a victory that was seen as a referendum on the self-ruled island’s approach to Beijing. Tsai’s victory was widely celebrated by Hong Kong activists, who called it a morale boost for their months-long protest movement, which was sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, and expressed hope her administration would support demonstrators who had fled there. widely celebrated “In the coming year, Hongkongers must continue to make our voices heard by the international community, to tell them that our fight against authoritarianism is not over yet,” said Ventus Lau Wing-hong, spokesman of the organiser, the Hong Kong Civil Assembly Team. “If Hong Kong has a Legislative Council that represents the voices of the people, that defends the interests of Hong Kong, the extradition bill would have been vetoed long ago. We would not have needed seven months of bloodshed.” The protest movement began in June last year when the government tried to pass a bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited from Hong Kong to mainland China or other jurisdictions the city does not have such an agreement with. The campaign morphed into a wider anti-government movement, with protesters calling for five demands, including a judge-led independent inquiry into police actions. protest movement  The organiser claimed 36,000 people took part in Sunday’s rally, while police put the figure at 3,000 at the event’s peak. Tsai Ing-wen wins her second term as Taiwan’s president with most ever votes Tsai Ing-wen wins her second term as Taiwan’s president with most ever votes Lau urged foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong officials if there was still no universal suffrage in the Legislative Council election later this year. This could be done by, for example, freezing their overseas assets or imposing economic sanctions on the city, he added. The protesters say the “unjust” functional constituencies, which return 35 lawmakers in the 70-seat legislature and have long been criticised for their “small circle” nature, should be scrapped.  Lau said the sanctions should also apply to government officials and police officers who violated human rights in the city.  Some waved flags calling for Hong Kong independence, as well as the US and British flags, at a rally that was held just about 200 metres from the People’s Liberation Army garrison. Among the speakers were US-based Hongkongers who flew back to the city to talk about the steps they had taken to raise awareness in the United States. The measures included organising rallies and setting up street booths in the US to spread their messages. In November, US President Donald Trump signed into law legislation that could bring diplomatic action and economic sanctions against Hong Kong, brushing off multiple warnings by China against such a move. A 19-year-old rally participant, Yeung, said if more foreign countries would impose sanctions, this would be a morale booster for Hong Kong protesters. Legal row after Hong Kong police take away protester from British consulate 11 Jan 2020 Legal row after Hong Kong police take away protester from British consulate 11 Jan 2020 The university student said he had no faith in the government but protesters must keep the social movement going until all five of their demands were met. “The election result in Taiwan is very encouraging to us. A lot of people here have been talking about it but we must not forget that our fight is here in Hong Kong,” he said. Another protester, 23-year-old Lau, supported international sanctions on Hong Kong if the government refused to introduce universal suffrage in September’s election, saying this was the way to keep the protest movement going. The university student said Tsai’s election victory was encouraging, adding the people of Hong Kong and Taiwan faced a common enemy, the Chinese government. The rally was organised to ramp up support for another protest, called “universal siege on communists”, that would take place next Sunday. After the event, police officers intercepted some people, many of them dressed in black, in Central and Admiralty and searched their bags. Two people were seen being taken to police vehicles. Meanwhile, two “yellow” restaurants in Wan Chai and Yuen Long supportive of the protest movement were vandalised by masked men late on Saturday night, with one employee being sent to hospital after the attack. Man Wah Restaurant in Wan Chai was attacked by seven men wielding hammers, who smashed the shop’s glass doors, computer screens, refrigerators and table tops, security camera footage showed. They later escaped in a private vehicle.

In Yuen Long, three masked men with hammers attacked Water Gate Chicken Rice, smashing up the restaurant’s glass door, two computer screens, a fingerprint scanner, tables and chairs. The three suspects ran away on foot. The restaurant also released CCTV footage of the attack, which showed the three men entering the premises as diners rushed to leave, while one family with a small child hid in the corner. No arrests have been made in either case. Previously, the Hung Hom location of Lung Mun cafe, also supportive of the protests, was targeted in October, with vandals smashing windows, computers, surveillance cameras and furniture.

Four Hong Kong universities have decided, in the wake of anti-government protests, to restrict access to campuses, including open spaces which members of the public were previously allowed to use. In the 2000s, Polytechnic University (PolyU), the University of Hong Kong (HKU), Baptist University and Lingnan University had all promised to keep some areas open to public access when they asked the government for more land. But checks by the Post showed they had recently blocked public access to such areas. Post With the new term starting this month, all eight publicly-funded universities tightened security, with checks for visitors and students, as well as limited vehicle access. Some also installed card-reading machines at entrances. This came after radical protesters entered several campuses last November, vandalised buildings and blocked nearby roads. The worst affected was PolyU, which was occupied by radical protesters for almost two weeks. Police surround Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus in stand-off with protesters Police surround Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus in stand-off with protesters The new campus security measures have sparked debate on whether universities should remain open to the public.  Although some feel the institutions are right to act, given the scenes of vandalism and destruction last November, others argue that campuses are part of the community and should remain open. From war zone to prison: voices from PolyU clash 2 Dec 2019 From war zone to prison: voices from PolyU clash 2 Dec 2019 “I often see many elderly people doing tai chi and their morning exercises on our campuses,” said Professor Tang Bo-sin, programme director of HKU’s urban planning programme. “It is a pity that the current arrangement has probably disallowed free access to the public and these community activities.” A check by the Post on land leases and relevant district council and Legislative Council documents of the eight publicly-funded universities found that at least four – PolyU, HKU, Baptist and Lingnan universities – had committed to providing “public open spaces” for outsiders when they sought government land grants. Post  These spaces are now blocked, including some ground floor areas and an open space in two parts of PolyU, as well as a garden in HKU’s new Centennial campus, a public area outside Baptist University’s journalism block, and some leisure spaces in Lingnan University.  Two sites – one at PolyU and another at Baptist University – were reopened last week following complaints. More than 8,000 petrol bombs ‘found in weapons factory at Chinese University’ 19 Nov 2019 More than 8,000 petrol bombs ‘found in weapons factory at Chinese University’ 19 Nov 2019 “It has been an unwritten rule over the past decades that universities will be open to everyone,” said urban designer Vincent Ng Wing-Shun. “The university managements embraced that openness and used it as a bargaining chip when they wanted new land.” HKU, for example, promised in 2009 to allow public access to its 1,900 square metre (20,451 sq ft) Centennial Garden, where its new Centennial campus is located. Now students and staff have to present their ID cards to enter, while visitors face security checks or require registration. Responding to queries from the Post, HKU said it would exercise flexibility in allowing access to the campus. Post, Lingnan University said it had offered its open area for public use, but restriction of access was needed “in light of current social situations”. A PolyU spokeswoman said it would act according to its land lease conditions. The campus in Hung Hom had promised in 2009 to keep an open space of 7,850 square metres (84,497 sq ft) available to the public at its new building, Block Z. In its land lease, another 6,436 square metres (68,889 sq ft) at the main campus was marked as mandatory for public access from 7am to 10pm. The campus, which was badly damaged in November, is now partly shut. The university has been installing turnstiles at its main entrances since early January and students and staff will be expected to tap their ID passes to enter when the new term begins on Monday.   Last Wednesday, security guards manned the entrances of the main campus, and uninvited visitors were forbidden from entering. At the entrance to Block Z – about a 10-minute walk from the main campus – a Post reporter was allowed to enter and visit the space that was reopened last week following media reports. Post Still, the passageway linking Block Z and the main campus was sealed, blocking any connection to the other open space. Owan Li, a Year Four PolyU student and a student representative on its governing council, felt the university was obliged under its land lease to open up its public spaces instead of “isolating itself from the outside world”.    However, an engineering masters student from the mainland said the new security measures were reassuring to PolyU students after last November’s campus crisis. “I believe it is better for the campus to remain semi-open for now and not to allow strangers in, especially after the events before which led to a suspension of our studies,” said the student, who asked to be identified only as Lu. Are Hong Kong’s universities becoming ‘weapons factories’ as claimed by police? 16 Nov 2019 Are Hong Kong’s universities becoming ‘weapons factories’ as claimed by police? 16 Nov 2019 Lingnan University in Tuen Mun promised the local district council in 2007 that residents would be able to use its open spaces, as well as a 300 square metre (3,229 sq ft) function room at its new campus block. Now all campus entrances are shut to outsiders, except for a passageway at the back, allowing members of the public to pass it on their way to other parts of the neighbourhood. A guard at a security checkpoint said only students, staff and authorised persons could enter the campus. Ivan Lam, 27, a research assistant at the university, felt it was a waste of resources to block access to the open spaces and function room, as the campus’ distant location made it an unlikely protest spot. When Baptist University was negotiating for land to build its School of Communication and Academy of Visual Arts building on Hereford Road in 2007, it promised public access to an open space of 1,800 square metres (19,375 sq ft). This area remains open to the public, but the rest of the campus is closed to outsiders. Urban designer Vincent Ng criticised the restrictions at the universities, as well as in other areas in Hong Kong, saying: “We are now setting fences, barricades on campuses, on bridges and in government complexes. A city should never use administrative measures to settle political problems. Needless to say, this also violates public rights.” A city should never use administrative measures to settle political problems Vincent Ng, urban designer But pro-establishment lawmaker Gary Chan Hak-kan, chairman of the legislative panel on security, said the tightened measures were understandable as many universities had been “traumatised” by radical protesters.    “Not only did the attacks damage the universities’ reputation, there were also protesters inside the campuses, and reports of dangerous substances and chemicals in laboratories being stolen,” Chan said. “The new measures are just acceptable protection.” He added that many universities around the world would not accept such intrusions, adding that the heightened security should remain in place as protests in the city had not died down. The new measures are just acceptable protection Gary Chan, pro-establishment lawmaker Professor Ng Mee-kam, director of Chinese University’s urban studies programme, felt there was room for flexibility, but stressed that universities could only serve as public utilities when they were not abused and left to function properly. “When a university notices ongoing protests in the city, I guess it can tighten measures right away and students and the public will understand,” she said. “But when the situation gradually quietens down, these measures can be relaxed – there can be guards, but they should allow the public to enter.”    French tourist Marian Gobeaux, 19, found the security measures “disturbing, but understandable” when he visited HKU. “Universities are supposed to be vibrant and dynamic, welcoming everyone. They serve as symbols of how open a city can be,” he said. He recalled that when he went to Australia on an exchange programme, he found that “everyone could enjoy the campus”. However, he said that in France, which has experienced terrorist attacks, there were entry restrictions on campuses in recent years. “There are guards to check everyone’s belongings and only invited visitors can get in.” A spokesman for the Lands Department said it had to study each case before considering whether there had been a breach of the land lease. Generally speaking, if a certain area had to be closed for temporary repairs, it would not be considered a violation, otherwise, the department would follow up and take further action based on complaints.

Believed to be a record-breaking number, they came from sectors and organisations including pro-democracy parties, civic groups and media associations. About 100 of them were district councillors.   The Hong Kong protests started in June with a peaceful mass rally against the now-withdrawn extradition bill, but escalated into a wider anti-government movement with radical elements resorting to violence. extradition bill Unmet demands of the campaign include establishing a commission of inquiry to investigate police conduct during demonstrations and restarting the city’s stalled political reform process. Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmaker Raymond Chan Chi-chuen said Tsai had successfully used a “fear approach” which linked the city’s extradition bill to draw in votes. “Of course it’s a genuine fear, but everyone could see that before the anti-extradition movement in Hong Kong, Tsai was at a disadvantage,” Chan said on a radio programme on Sunday. “But the situation surprised many Taiwanese and they do not want to become the next Hong Kong. “If Tsai has to come to Hong Kong and thank the protesters, she should also consider showing gratitude to Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-Ngor, the liaison office and Hong Kong police who stirred things up.” 	SCMP

Thirty years ago, the German artist was one of several who painted the Berlin Wall, risking the ire of East German guards. painted the Berlin Wall The wall came down in 1989 as Communism collapsed in Eastern Europe, and those murals have gone on to be exhibited and collected in cities around the world. Citny, now 62 and seeing Hong Kong’s protests become increasingly violent over the past seven months, wanted to do something similar again. The mural artist travelled to the city this week to paint a wall on a quiet side street off Hollywood Road in Sheung Wan, calling it his gift to the city’s pro-democracy protesters. His work features what Citny described as a young woman wearing a crown, a figure he dubbed ‘Miss Hong Kong’, emerging from stormy waves against a blue backdrop, holding a globe under her arm.  “She wants to rise. In order to rise, she has to get rid of all of the troubled water,” Citny said of the piece he called, ‘Hong Kong Unconquered’. “She’s like the Joan of Arc of Hong Kong.” From Manga-inspired front liners, to high school students nearly touching fingers in reference to Michelangelo’s ‘The Creation of Adam’ on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, protest art has thrived as Hong Kong’s anti-government movement has grown.  Some have called it an ideological struggle against China’s authoritarian rule, and made comparisons to Berlin during the Cold War, part of which was under the former Soviet Union’s control.  On a visit to the German capital last September, activist Joshua Wong told an audience at the city’s Humboldt University that, “if we are in a new cold war, Hong Kong is the new Berlin”. As last year marked the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Citny met Thomas D’Andrea, a UK-based curator, in a gallery in the city where Citny’s work was displayed. While the protests went on, D’Andrea suggested to Citny he should paint a mural for the city. “We worked together at what would be suitable,” said D’Andrea, who has visited Hong Kong several times over the past few months. This week, the two met in Hong Kong to execute the plan with help from local artists, who identified a patch of wall on Sai Street as a suitable location. D’Andrea said the work began on Wednesday afternoon, after the bought paint from a local shop. “I was afraid they didn’t have the colours we wanted,” he said. By Friday, the mural was largely finished, and two smaller canvases of the same image were taped onto the wall. Citny says they will be given to Hong Kong’s protesters as gifts. 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall Residents of the area, as well as tourists, have stopped to take photographs, and some spoke to Citny about his creation. “I’m really touched that this artist would come from a place so far just to give us a hint of hope,” said Annie Wong, 30, a Sheung Wan resident who works in the art industry. “I think it’s a beautiful painting, but I need to understand it more.” Painting the mural was Citny’s first visit to the city, but he has watched Hong Kong’s protests and compares it to a family feud, with Hong Kong the little daughter, and China the parent. “She [Hong Kong] is a rebel. She says, ‘no no no, I protest until I have my freedom’,” he said. Citny and D’Andrea plan on creating more murals in support of the protesters. The next is expected to be in Brussels, where other artists can take part to support the movement. “As an artist, the highest form of communication has a unique language that doesn’t need words to describe,” Citny said.

The 15-year-old was subsequently arrested, a police source said. A witness said riot officers took the girl, dressed in dark clothes, to their vehicle after she was found to be carrying a spray adhesive, which protesters have often used to affix posters and signs supporting the months-long civil unrest. Luke de Pulford, who sits on the British Conservative Party’s Human Rights Commission, said police should be summoned to explain themselves. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam visits wife of man set on fire by protester 12 Jan 2020 Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam visits wife of man set on fire by protester 12 Jan 2020 “The police should not have entered consular property without the express invitation of the consul general. By diplomatic convention, this territory is inviolable and under the UK’s authority,” he said. He said it did not look like the consulate had invited the force to break up the “peaceful demonstrations”.  But a senior police officer told the Post that the diplomatic office had called in the force to handle a criminal case. The girl was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, the officer said. Post Protesters had initially planned to head to government headquarters in Admiralty at 2pm, to post promotional materials and sticky notes to make a “Lennon Wall”, a mural of messages and artwork the like of which has sprung up across the city in support of the anti-government movement. Dozens detained by police after march against parallel traders in Hong Kong’s Sheung Shui Dozens detained by police after march against parallel traders in Hong Kong’s Sheung Shui But with a strong presence of riot police in the area, some went to the nearby consulate building, placing Post-it messages on boards outside.  The witness, surnamed Wong, also 15, said riot police took the girl away after they found the spray adhesive inside her bag.  Wong was among about 10 protesters who joined the calls to erect the Lennon Wall, and said the scene was “very peaceful initially”. She was released with others after police checked her ID card, bag and body. According to documents from the Land Registry, the outdoor area where the incident happened is part of a 6,500 square metre plot which the government granted to the British diplomatic body in 1994, as a non-exclusive right of way. “The lease specified that the British consulate is the owner of the area, but it has authorised the public to use it. It’s an open space, so it was reasonable for the police to enforce the law Eunice Yung, barrister and legislator The Consular Relations Ordinance states that Hong Kong authorities “shall not enter part of the consular premises” used exclusively for the purpose of the work of the consular post, “except with the consent of the head of the consular post or of his designee or of the head of the diplomatic mission”. “The consent of the head of the consular post may, however, be assumed in case of fire or other disaster requiring prompt protective action,” it adds. Democratic Party legislator James To Kun-sun, also a lawyer, said officers could not in principle enforce the law at the site without the consulate’s consent. “Mainly it’s about the lease. If it admitted that the area was part of the British consulate, then it was not allowed,” he said. But Eunice Yung Hoi-yan, a barrister and deputy chairwoman of the Legislative Council’s security panel, argued it was legitimate for police to take action. “I’m not sure whether the woman has committed other offences, such as loitering or causing disorder in public places. But the area is not enclosed,” said Yung, of the pro-Beijing New People’s Party. “The lease specified that the British consulate is the owner of the area, but it has authorised the public to use it. It’s an open space, so it was reasonable for the police to enforce the law.” A spokeswoman for the British foreign office noted simply that it was aware of police attending a long-running protest outside its consulate in Hong Kong on Saturday.

Reverend Canon Peter Koon Ho-ming also revealed that more information about Chan Tong-kai’s plans could be released soon. The 20-year-old is wanted on the self-governing island for killing his pregnant girlfriend, Poon Hiu-wing, in Taipei in February 2018. Chan returned to Hong Kong after her death, and served time on related money-laundering charges. He could not be sent back to face murder charges, for lack of an extradition deal between the two jurisdictions. Asked before election results came in if the suspect would change his mind if Tsai kept her job, Koon said: “Since his release, Chan has never left Hong Kong or changed his mind about returning to Taiwan to turn himself in. This would not be affected by whoever wins the election.” Taiwan presidential election: ads reflect contrasting campaigns of hopefuls Tsai Ing-wen and Han Kuo Taiwan presidential election: ads reflect contrasting campaigns of hopefuls Tsai Ing-wen and Han Kuo “We hope to disclose more information soon,” he added. Chan’s case helped spark Hong Kong’s current political crisis, when the local government proposed an extradition bill to allow fugitive transfers to jurisdictions with which the city lacks a formal agreement, including Taiwan.  The legislation triggered mass protests – which are still ongoing, after seven months – and has since been withdrawn. President Tsai, of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, has played up the Hong Kong protests as a cautionary tale of Beijing’s encroachment. She was re-elected on Saturday, seeing off the challenges of Han Kuo-yu of the mainland-friendly Kuomintang and James Soong Chu-yu, from the People First Party. Release of murder suspect: media scrum, press motorcade and police protection 23 Oct 2019 Release of murder suspect: media scrum, press motorcade and police protection 23 Oct 2019 Shortly before Chan was released from Pik Uk Correctional Institution on October 23, after 19 months in custody, Koon revealed that the suspect, whom he had been visiting for months, had offered to turn himself in.  But the revelation sparked another political storm, by setting Hong Kong and Taipei at loggerheads over how Chan should face justice. The city’s government has accused Taiwan of politicising the case.    Chan, now a free man, has been living in a local safe house provided by police. Last month, Taiwan authorities hit out at their Hong Kong counterparts again for rejecting their request for legal help in a separate case, after the island’s police arrested a man in connection with a robbery in Hong Kong. Taiwanese law allows suspects in robberies committed in Hong Kong and Macau to be tried in the island’s courts.

I already expected to be doxxed and attacked on the streets randomly, and also during operations in the worst of cases. “Yet I am honoured to be part of this historic mission.”  Cheung’s biggest concern at the time was the safety of her family, but their unwavering support has turned into the biggest motivation for her in the new role.

As part of the Correctional Emergency Response Team trained to escort high-risk inmates and deal with prison riots and other emergencies, Cheung was among 200 riot control specialists loaned to the police force to ease the burden on staff stretched to the limit by anti-government protests. The prisons group is among 300 elite unit members appointed in November by police – with others from customs and immigration – to shore up manpower.  The Post was told that another 100 correctional staff were enlisted last month to join the uphill battle.

Cheung said she was surprised by the stamp of approval from some members of the public. For her teammate David Lee*, however, his group was cursed at by opponents at the same site. Lee, who has a one-year-old child, said: “A woman stopped in front of us and told her 10-year-old kid that we were dogs and that we beat up people randomly. “It did not upset me. My duty is not about arresting people who scold us. But as a father, I was surprised by her behaviour in front of a child.

Officers should remain highly alert but only take action when someone violated the law, he added. “I told them that we can’t anticipate the length [of how long we will be on loan to police]. There could be nothing major happening, or we may face the worst violence on our first day of duty,” Chan said. Soon after the government announced the manpower boost for the force, online users had suggested to intercept and attack the motorcade of special constables.

Lee Chi-cheung, a 57-year-old father of two, has been in hospital since the attack on November 11 after he had chased a group of masked protesters who had vandalised Ma On Shan MTR station. Lee confronted a group of protesters, before being doused with flammable liquid and set alight. He suffered second-degree burns on 28 per cent of his body, mainly his chest and arms. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor was the highest-ranking local official to meet Lee’s family, after Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po visited Lee in hospital on December 15. Writing on her Facebook page on Saturday, Lam revealed that she has met Lee’s wife on Saturday, alongside Stanley Ng Chau-pei, the president of the pro-Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, as well as FTU vice-president Chow Luen-kiu, from the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union.  “After several rounds of surgery, Mr Lee is still in hospital. To show their care, some of my construction sector friends raised HK$100,000 and gave it to Mrs Lee earlier,” Lam wrote. Hong Kong protester shot with live round as unrest in city enters sixth month Hong Kong protester shot with live round as unrest in city enters sixth month “I, together with them, gave her another HK$300,000 in donations today, and extended our sympathy to her and Mr Lee. We hope he will get well soon.” Lam took the opportunity to hit out at Lee’s attackers, saying they had failed to tolerate different views held by other people.  “Rioters ... arbitrarily take things into their own hands, intimidating and attacking the innocent, and [in this case] setting a person alight,” she wrote.  Police have classified the case as attempted murder and arrested at least two people on suspicion of disorder in a public place on that day. But no one has yet to be arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Lam lamented that days after the attack, clashes between anti-government protesters and residents in Sheung Shui claimed the life of a 70-year-old contract cleaner for the government, surname Luo, after he was struck by a brick. That incident was being treated as murder and the force arrested five teenagers, aged 15 to 18, last month in connection with the case.  “It is infuriating that rioters’ barbaric and despicable acts are hidden or glorified, because of some media outlets’ biased reporting, as well as fake information and rumours on the internet,” she said.

In Admiralty, protesters initially planned to stick promotional materials and sticky notes to re-form a “Lennon Wall” near government headquarters from 2pm. A Lennon Wall is an area where messages of support for protesters are posted. But with a heavy presence of riot police in the area, about two dozen protesters took trams to Causeway Bay later in the afternoon to decorate the blue footbridge at the junction of Hennessy Road and Percival Street with stickers and posters. Some were written with slogans such as “Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our times!”, while the others promoted the upcoming rallies this month. Admiralty’s Lennon Wall, posted with collages of Post-it notes, was a landmark feature of the 2014 Occupy protests. It was located next to an outdoor staircase at the headquarters. Since the unrest, triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, snowballed into a months-long anti-government movement, Lennon Walls have sprung up across the city’s 18 districts, mostly in public areas such as footbridges and underpasses, and have also been the flashpoints for clashes between protesters and those who support the authorities and police.  Teacher Renit Wong, 35, was one of those who posted promotional material at the footbridge in Causeway Bay. She noted many Lennon Walls across the city had been cleared by authorities, so she would like to redecorate them. She admitted the movement had quietened down, but hoped her work would be seen by more residents. “It’s a good promotion. A lot of people can see these,” she said.   A 16-year-old student, who only gave their surname of Kwong, echoed that sentiment. She said when protesters tried to make Lennon Walls in their areas, the material would be cleared in two or three days.  “We want to keep igniting the passion of the movement,” she said.  Over in Sha Tin a group of elderly people who support the protests organised an event inside New Town Plaza to promote “yellow” businesses in the area. Shops and service providers who support protesters are deemed “yellow”, while those with mainland Chinese backgrounds or those that support the police are put in the “blue” camp. The group handed out fliers with information on yellow restaurants and retailers, as well as list of day-to-day products listing out their places of origin. A retiree in her 60s, who gave her name as Chong, said she hoped to support the protesters by spending more at yellow businesses. “For instance, I go to a salon that employs the youngsters,” she said. Chong conceded she could not withstand the more physically demanding protests and wanted to find alternative ways of supporting the movement. 	SCMP

The Hong Kong Secondary Schools Debate Competition, which began in November last year, had attracted participants from 121 local schools. Last month, at least four schools withdrew after vocal pro-Beijingers objected to some of the debate motions, such as “Restructuring the police force does more good than harm” and “Hong Kong people should fight for Hong Kong independence”. The city’s pro-Beijing teachers’ union, the Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers, and newspaper Ta Kung Pao were among the competition’s critics. Ta Kung Pao Five other schools pulled out earlier because of scheduling issues. According to a volunteer member of the organising body, the Hong Kong Schools Debate Federation, 14 more schools had pulled out as of Saturday, reducing the number of participating groups to 98.  The member, who only gave her surname as Chan, said the 14 schools did not give organisers detailed reasons for their pulling out. “But we know school administrations had told teachers and debate team coaches to pull out because some debate topics are political,” Chan said.  Citing feedback from the education sector, Chan also said the government had contacted schools asking if they were taking part in the competition, and urging them “not to debate sensitive issues during sensitive times”.   In some cases, teachers were told to submit a list of names of team members to the bureau if pupils refused to pull out, she said.  Hong Kong has been rocked by civil unrest for more than seven months, with protesters and police regularly engaged in violent clashes on the city’s streets. According to Chan, about 40 per cent of the 145 finalised topics were related to economic issues, while only 20 per cent dealt with politics. She insisted the competition was politically neutral, noting that the opposing team won in the first round when debating whether to restructure the police force. Hong Kong protests loom large in Taiwan polls. But who benefits? 11 Jan 2020 Hong Kong protests loom large in Taiwan polls. But who benefits? 11 Jan 2020 “The bureau should not put pressure on the schools and they can contact us directly,” she said. The bureau said it had been in touch with schools over the competition, but did not say if it had told any to withdraw from the competition. “The relevant debate competition has raised concerns, as many topics are related to social events in recent months and are skewed,” a spokesman said. He also said some issues, such as advocacy for Hong Kong independence, had “no room for meaningful debates”. Schools should not send students into activities that may bring negative influences, he added. Chan also said students should be able to debate issues they would encounter in their daily lives, and added that organisers would not change the topics already selected. There had been no complaints from parents, she said. “What we can do now is to explain more to schools and students … to allay concerns,” Chan said. 	SCMP

City University, which saw a HK$100 million (US$12.9 million) year-on-year drop in donations according to figures from the last financial year, also warned that there would be a spillover effect on the city’s development in the long run from schools’ loss of income. Among the more than 6,000 arrests police have made since protests first erupted last June, nearly 40 per cent were students, with some 700 from universities. Night clashes around Hong Kong Polytechnic University Night clashes around Hong Kong Polytechnic University Polytechnic University, the University of Hong Kong, Chinese University and CityU were schools with the most students arrested. In November, protesters have also occupied universities, blocked nearby roads and vandalised buildings, with police saying radicals had turned campuses into petrol bomb factories.  Some of the most intense clashes occurred at PolyU and CUHK, wrecking swathes of their premises. Last week CUHK said HK$70 million was needed for campus restorations, while CityU, where protesters had vandalised facilities and trashed the president’s office, said a nine-digit sum would be needed for repairs. On Friday a CityU spokeswoman said in reply to a Post inquiry that the social unrest had affected the whole community, including every university in the city, in aspects from admission figures to income from tuition fees and donations. Post Inside the occupied Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus Inside the occupied Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus “Apart from a direct impact on the university’s development, these could also affect Hong Kong’s technological innovation, internationalisation and diversification in the long term.  “This has been a consequence that the whole of Hong Kong has to bear, and all stakeholders should come together to seek a solution,” she said. CityU president Way Kuo also told Chinese-language newspaper Sing Tao Daily on Friday that some donors had pulled out from previous commitments or even planned to withdraw amounts previously donated, while there were also others who delayed remaining sums of donations. Sing Tao Daily  Lawmaker Felix Chung Kwok-pan said he knew of a case in which a donor at PolyU had put donations on hold amid the protests, although the exact reasons were unspecified. “[The donor] felt universities have been caught up in the chaos, and hoped to postpone donations for now ... but that doesn’t mean the donation won’t come at the end of the day,” he said. Fung Wai-wah, a senior lecturer at CityU and a member of its governing council, said the body had not discussed donations during a meeting last November. But he expected some donors to be dissatisfied with students’ participation in protests, adding that a drop in donations could bring significant impacts to university operations. “It is possible that without donations, a surplus during the financial year could turn into a deficit for the university,” he said. “I hope donors can realise that in the long term, the healthy development of a university depends much on support from the community.” The campuses of Baptist University, HKU and the University of Science and Technology have also come under vandalism by protesters last November, although the damage was less severe. A Baptist University spokeswoman said on Friday they had not encountered any donors withdrawing support, while PolyU, HKU, HKUST and CUHK did not comment on whether their sponsors had pulled out amid the protests. University chiefs in crossfire as protest tensions risk campuses becoming political battlefields 31 Oct 2019 University chiefs in crossfire as protest tensions risk campuses becoming political battlefields 31 Oct 2019 A Post review of universities’ 2018/19 financial reports – with the year ending on June 30, a month into the anti-government protests sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill – found that at least five schools suffered a drop in donations. Post HKU recorded the biggest plunge, with the amount in its “donations and benefactions” category dropping by about HK$200 million year on year. CityU and PolyU also saw a drop of nearly HK$100 million in donations each. A university source told the Post that a significant drop in varsity donations during the last financial year “could still be normal” as there were many variables, for instance, some donations might be delayed as it took time for talks with donors. Post The source added that the government’s Eighth Matching Grant Scheme – in which the government will match each dollar donated to universities – only began in July, and there might be deferred payments brought over to the current financial year that were not reflected. But the source also admitted that the economic downturn triggered by the ongoing protests could mean a dampened mood for donations, especially if donors owned businesses which were hit by the civil unrest.

That is less than half of the HK$21,000 (US$2,700) Hong Kong sets as the poverty line for a four-person household. Liu, 39, her husband, 47, and their two children – a 19-year-old daughter and six-year-old son – live in a 300 sq ft public rental housing flat in Kowloon Bay with a monthly rent of HK$2,000. Asking to be identified only by her surname, Liu, who is originally from mainland China, married her Hongkonger husband in 2001 and moved to the city in 2008. Their daughter was born the year they married, and their son was born in 2013. Life changed for Liu after her son was born. Aside from being autistic, he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and is deaf in his left ear, but can hear with his right ear after cochlear implant surgery. The former waitress quit her job four years ago to take care of the boy. His medical expenses have further strained the family’s meagre income.  Her husband used to earn about HK$20,000 a month working at construction sites. But the anti-government protests, which have engulfed Hong Kong for more than seven months, affected the construction sector and left him jobless. For about three months, the family had no income. Now he takes odd jobs at restaurants from early morning until midnight, spending little time with the family. Some nights, he sleeps in parks if he misses the last train home, Liu says. One in five Hongkongers living below the poverty line in 2018 13 Dec 2019 One in five Hongkongers living below the poverty line in 2018 13 Dec 2019 “It is so hard for him, and I wish I could go out to work to help relieve some of his burden,” she says.  Their daughter dropped out of school after Form Three and earns only about HK$1,000 from part-time jobs, so she still depends on her parents.  Liu says the burden is not only economic. The bitterness of being poor in a glamorous city makes her cry almost every day. “I’m so desperate,” she says, tears rolling down her cheeks. “I’m happy to do whatever I can for my family and take care of my boy, but I haven’t seen much improvement. I don’t know how to go on.” The number of poor people in Hong Kong reached a 10-year high, at about 1.41 million in 2018, accounting for 20.4 per cent of the total population, according to the latest poverty situation report released by the government in December. The number of poor people in Hong Kong reached a 10-year high, at about 1.41 million in 2018, accounting for 20.4 per cent of the total population, according to the latest poverty situation report released by the government in December. That means more than one in five people lived below the city’s poverty line – with a monthly income of HK$4,000 for one person, HK$10,000 for a two-person household, and HK$16,500 for a three-person household. The unemployed, the elderly, single-parent households and new-arrival families – which refer to households with at least one member who is a one-way permit holder from the mainland and has lived in Hong Kong for less than seven years – are at higher risk of poverty, the report shows. Poverty figures not as high as official report says, welfare chief argues 14 Dec 2019 Poverty figures not as high as official report says, welfare chief argues 14 Dec 2019 An increase in poverty among young people aged 18 to 29 has also raised a red flag. The youth poverty rate reached 12.6 per cent in 2018, up from 11.9 per cent in 2015. The report says government help in the form of recurrent cash benefits reduced the number of poor people to about 1.02 million. Secretary for Labour and Welfare Law Chi-kwong has argued that in fact, the poor population was even lower, at 910,000, although he conceded the figure was still high. Experts say the statistics do not truly reflect the poverty situation. I’m so desperate. I’m happy to do whatever I can for my family and take care of my boy, but I haven’t seen much improvement. I don’t know how to go on Kowloon mum Liu Chinese University economist Terence Chong Tai-leung says the government’s definition of poverty – having an income that is less than half the city’s median monthly household income – is a relative figure. “They are poor, compared to others,” he says. Professor Paul Yip Siu-fai, associate dean of the faculty of social sciences of the University of Hong Kong (HKU), adds that the city’s economic development – which grew 3 per cent in 2018 – does not benefit most Hongkongers, especially low-income households. Yip, who is chair professor of population health at HKU, points to the general population increase, ageing society, and growing number of small-sized households and says: “We have more people, more elderly and more single people. All these contribute to the increasing number of poor people.” Hong Kong’s homeless and NGOs that help them hit hard by protest crisis 8 Dec 2019 Hong Kong’s homeless and NGOs that help them hit hard by protest crisis 8 Dec 2019 Not having a job has a big impact on poverty levels.

Elderly people who are retired with no income are at a greater risk of poverty. About 516,600 people, or 44.4 per cent of the total elderly population, are poor. Their poverty rate was more than double that of the overall population. Wong Suet-ying, 70, and her husband Law Kin-fat, 64, both retired, share a 200 sq ft public rental housing flat in Kwun Tong with their three grandchildren – a 14-year-old boy and his sisters, aged 13 and nine. The children’s parents are unable to care for them, and Wong declines to elaborate on the reasons. With no income, the household of five gets by on a monthly allowance of about HK$17,000 under the government’s Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) welfare scheme. Before moving into the subsidised flat in 2017, they moved every year for four years between private rented flats. “We lived a constantly unstable life,” Wong says. Although they now have a flat, with two bunk beds, life is a struggle. Wong has rheumatoid arthritis, and her husband has cirrhosis. “We are living from pay cheque to pay cheque,” she says. “Usually we have more at the beginning of the month, but less at the end of the month.” With a rising number of Hongkongers remaining single, getting divorced or having fewer children, household size has shrunk from 2.85 people in 2009, to 2.68 people in 2018. The number of one and two people households has risen, accounting for 48.3 per cent of all households in 2018. from 2.85 people in 2009, to 2.68 people in 2018. he number of one and two people households has risen, accounting for 48.3 per cent of all households in 2018.

Poor, disabled, old: the forgotten voices of the Hong Kong protests 6 Dec 2019 Poor, disabled, old: the forgotten voices of the Hong Kong protests 6 Dec 2019 Their third-floor space is one of five units in a subdivided flat that has a total of 13 occupants. Li has no bed or refrigerator, only a mattress she shares with her son. She says she pays a reduced rent of HK$6,000 a month because the area is a regular protest site. The poorly ventilated flat becomes stuffier when she closes the windows to prevent tear gas fired by the police from getting in. The former receptionist stopped working after her son was diagnosed with autism in 2018, and now relies on a monthly CSSA allowance of about HK$11,000. She says her ex-husband does not help, and she is not close to her parents or younger brother. I feel depressed with no way to vent my emotions, but it is my love for my son that has kept pushing me forward Li, 27 Li says the hardship has taken a toll on her. She has lost weight and copes with depression. “Life is hard for single-parent families, let alone those with children who have special needs,” she says. “I feel depressed with no way to vent my emotions, but it is my love for my son that has kept pushing me forward.” Sze Lai-shan, community organiser of the Society for Community Organisation, says poor families with children are among those who suffer the most. “Bad living environments can cause them to have emotional problems and lose self-esteem, and a lack of money for the children’s education can affect their school performance,” she says. “It can lead to a vicious intergenerational cycle of poverty.” ‘Current measures have limited impact’ ‘Current measures have limited impact’ Warning that a worsening poverty situation can cause social instability, experts and lawmakers say the government should do more. Labour Party lawmaker Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung says the city’s poverty situation is dire and can worsen the ongoing political turmoil. “The social movement has arisen from a deep sense of injustice, and this injustice will spread over from political concerns such as personal security, liberty and democracy to social issues such as poverty,” he says. Enhanced welfare package will lift some 27,000 people out of poverty 14 Jan 2020 Enhanced welfare package will lift some 27,000 people out of poverty 14 Jan 2020 The government and non-governmental organisations have been helping the poor with cash allowances and services over the years, and the administration’s interventions lifted 382,200 people out of poverty in 2018, reducing the overall poverty rate by 5.5 percentage points, according to statistics. Among them, CSSA remained the most effective measure, helping in more than 221,000 cases involving about 312,000 recipients by the end of September 2019. Two initiatives – the Higher Old Age Living Allowance (OALA) for the elderly, and the Working Family Allowance (WFA) for working families – were implemented in 2018. But Cheung says the current measures have limited impact compared with a universal retirement pension system which will be more effective in tackling the growing number of elderly poor. He also suggests more support for the disabled. Peace Wong Wo-ping, chief officer of social security and employment of the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, says the government should raise the minimum wage – currently HK$37.5 per hour – to support low-income households prone to poverty. “Hong Kong has a wide income gap. The government should tackle the poverty problem from the first distribution of the market to reduce the number of people who need support,” he says. Edward Man Ho-wai, founder of the charitable organisation ChickenSoup Foundation, established in 2013 to serve poor families, says NGOs can provide services and care to the poor, complementing cash support from the government. “Money is no doubt necessary to help them, but it alone can’t solve the problem,” he says. “Most poor people don’t know how to use resources efficiently.” Mok Hing-luen, 61, a retired senior lecturer in social work at City University, visits poor households regularly. He says many of the poor have low self-esteem and feel isolated, and their mental well-being needs to be cared for too. American trio win Nobel Economics Prize for work on poverty 14 Oct 2019 American trio win Nobel Economics Prize for work on poverty 14 Oct 2019 Cheung expects the poverty situation to worsen, given the ongoing political unrest and gloomy economic outlook. He also thinks the city’s embattled government is unlikely to introduce major changes or reforms. Given the economic downturn that looks likely to continue this year, he is not hopeful about the prospects of new measures to help the poor any time soon. “We could be looking at an even worse situation,” he says.

But who benefits?	“Hong Kong is not far from Taiwan, just the distance of a flight ticket; Taiwan is not far from Hong Kong, just the distance of a ballot.” That is a popular saying shared online in the two places as Taiwan’s presidential election approaches on Saturday. It resonates with Hong Kong protesters because one of their core demands is for the head of the city’s government to be elected by popular ballot, a system already in place in Taiwan. For Taiwanese voters, the saying was a timely reminder to return home to cast their vote. Among those heading back was first-time voter Mrs Kao, a mother of two in her 50s. “I’ve never voted before, even when I was living in Taiwan. I just did not care and found candidates from both camps were not good enough,” said Kao, who moved to Hong Kong 15 years ago. For the first time, Kao wanted to make her voice heard even though she had to spend thousands of dollars on flight tickets and take leave from work.  “It is pathetic to see Hong Kong losing its freedoms and democracy. It reminds me that I have to cherish my vote, and safeguard democracy in Taiwan,” she said. “I don’t want Taiwan to lose its democracy and end up like Hong Kong.” Taiwan presidential election: ads reflect contrasting campaigns of hopefuls Tsai Ing-wen and Han Kuo Taiwan presidential election: ads reflect contrasting campaigns of hopefuls Tsai Ing-wen and Han Kuo In her eyes, the choice between incumbent Tsai Ing-wen, of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), and her populist rival, Kaohsiung city mayor Han Kuo-yu from the Beijing-friendly Kuomintang (KMT), was clear.  “Han will lead our path closer to China. The closer to China, the greater the danger for our democracy,” she believed.  The protests in Hong Kong have also led younger voters to support Tsai. One of them is Natalie Wang – not her real name – who has worked for a retail company in Hong Kong for more than five years. ‘Make the right choice’: the Hongkongers championing democracy ... in Taiwan 10 Jan 2020 ‘Make the right choice’: the Hongkongers championing democracy ... in Taiwan 10 Jan 2020 Tsai came to power in 2016 by defeating her main rival, Eric Chu Li-lun of the KMT. But thirty-something Wang said she did not go home for that election as she did not think either candidate would make much difference. “After closely witnessing what has happened in Hong Kong, I understand how politics will affect our lives and I just feel the urge to return home and cast my vote,” Wang said. The protests, sparked in June by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, have since morphed into a wider anti-government movement. Wang said she joined the massive protests in June, and recalled how “shocking and moving” it was to see a million people taking to the streets in solidarity. The protests served as a warning sign for Taiwan, she said. “Beijing has already suppressed our diplomatic space and reiterated that Taiwan is part of its territory … If a pro-Communist Party candidate wins this time, Taiwan could be the next Hong Kong,” Wang said. “And it would be us handing it over to them, with our own hands.” KMT candidate Han supports the “1992 consensus” – an understanding that there is only “one China” but with different interpretations of what “China” means. But relations between Taipei and Beijing have deteriorated under Tsai, as Beijing insists the consensus is a prerequisite for dialogue between the two sides, a condition the DPP rejects. In January, President Xi Jinping, whose administration in Beijing regards Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to reclaim it, proposed that the two sides send representatives for unification talks under the “one country, two systems” model, which already gives limited autonomy to Hong Kong and Macau. Tsai immediately rejected the proposal, saying no one in Taiwan wanted one country, two systems, given its application in Hong Kong. Against the backdrop of Xi’s proposal, Tsai has successfully reframed the 2020 poll as a vote to save the island of 23 million people from being annexed by the mainland and people from losing their ability to identify as Taiwanese, according to observers. Her campaign office on Tuesday released a video, using split screens to compare the daily routines of Taiwanese and the chaotic protest scenes Hongkongers have faced over recent months, giving a strong message to not “let Taiwan be like Hong Kong”. To Ceci Lin, 30, who has lived in Hong Kong for almost seven years, Tsai’s warning of “Today’s Hong Kong; tomorrow’s Taiwan” has simplified many local factors and history in both places. Yet Lin, not her real name, conceded the protests prompted her to return home to vote for Tsai, although she grew up in a KMT-supporting family. “The Hong Kong protests made me more worried about the idea of one country, two systems,” she said. Taiwan’s repurposed ageing military bunkers Taiwan’s repurposed ageing military bunkers However, Han is not without young supporters. On Thursday night, his backers joined a mass rally in Taipei, with the organiser estimating the turnout at one million. Among the relatively small contingent of young participants was 28-year-old Joey. He argued that Tsai’s policies would turn Taiwan into an unstable society, like Hong Kong. “The stronger the stance we hold against Beijing, the tougher the tactics Beijing will come up with in handling cross-strait relations,” he said. “I am afraid Tsai’s route will only lead us in Hong Kong’s direction.” 	SCMP

The government on Thursday had insisted the ban on face coverings was vital to curb the ongoing unrest in the city, but on Friday, Johannes Chan Man-mun SC, representing 24 opposition legislators who challenged the anti-mask legislation, tried to paint a different picture at the Court of Appeal. vital to curb the ongoing unrest With a mask ban in place, peaceful demonstrators would be left in fear of retaliation, no longer able to hide their identities from employers who might want to punish them amid highly polarised times, he said. Those who wanted to wear a Winnie the Pooh mask – a dig at President Xi Jinping – would also be deprived of their political relief, Chan argued. “This goes to the very core of our freedom of expression,” he said. In November, the Court of First Instance ruled unconstitutional a mask law enacted by the government in October that banned the wearing of face coverings at both lawful and unlawful rallies. ruled unconstitutional The ban aimed to put an end to the increasing level of violence seen during months of protests, which were triggered by the government’s now-withdrawn extradition bill.  But it led 24 opposition lawmakers and veteran activist “Long Hair” Leung Kwok-hung to challenge the legislation, giving rise to the present court battle. Protesters gather to mark one month since mask ban was introduced Protesters gather to mark one month since mask ban was introduced The government on Thursday began its two-day appeal against the lower court’s ruling.   On Friday, Chan cited the example of Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways, which said it would fire staff if they took part in illegal protests. He added that civil servants could equally be deprived of opportunities to be heard.  “The mask itself could be a message,” he added, referring to those who wore Guy Fawkes masks at rallies, made popular by the Hollywood film V for Vendetta and used as a symbol against repression. V for Vendetta Chan also said the way in which the mask law was structured was too wide in that it applied to all rallies and those who were present without actually taking part. He did not dispute that there were violent protesters at demonstrations, but he challenged whether it was justified for the law to go so far and wide. Suspension for 31 civil servants arrested over Hong Kong protests 10 Jan 2020 Suspension for 31 civil servants arrested over Hong Kong protests 10 Jan 2020 Benjamin Yu SC, for the government, countered, saying Chan had only presented one side of the picture. He cited a past ruling by the Court of Appeal, in which judges referred to violent actions at a protest as “an unhealthy wind”, when they ruled on the case involving activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung and two other student leaders storming the government headquarters. Yu likened the current violence in Hong Kong to a “typhoon”. High Court chief judge Jeremy Poon Shiu-chor, who presided over the appeal with justices Johnson Lam Man-hon and Thomas Au Hing-cheung, will hand down their ruling on a later date. 	SCMP

In another development that could intensify tensions between officials and pan-democrats, the government also vowed to push ahead with two controversial projects in Wan Chai and Kwun Tong, worth HK$190 million (US$24 million) in total, despite earlier attempts by opposition district councillors to suspend them. Riding on anti-government sentiment fuelled by the months-long social unrest, the pro-democracy bloc won nearly 90 per cent of the 452 seats in local elections in November, seizing control of 17 out of 18 district councils amid a record turnout and in a humiliating defeat for the pro-establishment camp. social unrest local elections Pan-democrat members of at least nine district councils had previously made clear they would snub Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung’s meeting. they would snub Three groups – the Democratic Party, Civic Party and Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People’s Livelihood – also declared they would join the boycott. They objected to Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor meeting defeated pro-establishment candidates earlier but sending her No 2 to meet them.  Cheung said the turnout on Friday was not the main issue. Suspension for 31 civil servants arrested over Hong Kong protests 10 Jan 2020 Suspension for 31 civil servants arrested over Hong Kong protests 10 Jan 2020 “Of course, we are disappointed,” he said. “But most important is that everyone [who attended] has the will … We have the goodwill and sincerity to really build good interaction with the new district councils.” Cheung also said his discussions on Friday focused on livelihood issues, as he listened to speeches of 20 district councillors at North Point Community Hall.  Eight other officials, including Secretary for Home Affairs Lau Kong-wah, also attended. Pro-democracy councillors in Kwun Tong are trying to halt construction of a HK$50 million (US$6.4 million) fountain while those in Wan Chai are attempting to stop an activities centre, which has a HK$140 million (US$18 million) price tag, from being built.  Lau said the two projects, which critics have called white elephants, would continue as they were given the green light by the district councils in previous terms and by the Legislative Council. The contracts of the projects had also been approved already, he added. “Based on the spirit of respecting procedures and contracts, and cherishing public money, we will continue to push ahead with the works,” Lau said. Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing camp reeling after crushing defeat in district council elections Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing camp reeling after crushing defeat in district council elections Kwun Tong District Council chairman Choy Chak-hung strongly condemned Lau’s comments. Choy said the council had just passed a motion calling for the building work to be halted and for officials to disclose contract details. “It’s to allow residents to learn about the work progress and let them voice their views. It’s very reasonable. I don’t understand why the government can be this imperious,” he said. Clarisse Yeung Suet-ying, chairwoman of Wan Chai District Council, also said the government had neglected the voices of residents who were concerned whether public money was being well spent. 	SCMP

But the students themselves have no right to vote on the self-governing island. They – and the cookies – have travelled 700km from Hong Kong, a city embroiled in social unrest since June. The students were already enrolled at the school when the anti-government movement kicked off in their hometown, sparked by proposed extradition legislation which has since been withdrawn. When they returned to the Taiwan campus in September, they hoped to contribute to the movement even while abroad. About 30 of them formed a concern group, holding various activities hoping to focus their classmates’ attention on the struggle in Hong Kong.  “We scored a landslide victory in the district council elections in Hong Kong. I hope Taiwanese people will not underestimate the vote in their hands,” said a core member, who gave her name as Y. “No matter who they vote for, we just want to remind them to exercise their rights,” said the fifth-year theatre student. Chinese university deletes study forecasting win for Tsai in Taiwan poll 17 Feb 2020 Chinese university deletes study forecasting win for Tsai in Taiwan poll 17 Feb 2020 In Hong Kong’s local council polls in November, record voter turnout helped pro-democracy candidates sweep nearly 90 per cent of seats, taking control of 17 of 18 districts.  The biscuits – made by another group of Hongkongers, who wanted to spread their message to Taiwan – were quite well received, with some local students offering encouragement to the movement in Hong Kong.  A group member who called herself C, a fourth-year student of fine art, said Taiwanese voters should treasure the right to elect their president, especially when Hong Kong voters can only directly elect district councillors and about half of the legislature’s members. “We just hope Taiwanese people can take their responsibility and make the right choice. We envy the electoral system here in Taiwan, as universal suffrage is something Hongkongers have longed for. Who is satisfied to be ruled by an appointed puppet?” she said. Taiwan presidential election: ads reflect contrasting campaigns of hopefuls Tsai Ing-wen and Han Kuo Taiwan presidential election: ads reflect contrasting campaigns of hopefuls Tsai Ing-wen and Han Kuo C was referring to Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, elected in 2017 by a 1,200-member committee dominated by pro-Beijing politicians and business elites. Taiwan’s leader, Tsai Ing-wen of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, has been using the campaign slogan “Hong Kong today, Taiwan tomorrow” in her fight to retain the presidency, playing up the Hong Kong protests as a cautionary tale of Beijing’s encroachment. In Tsai’s latest campaign video, her team also pointed to the plight of Hong Kong youngsters, urging Taiwanese people to “stand with democracy and freedom”. Recent opinion polls have shown Tsai leading her rival Han Kuo-yu, mayor of the southern city of Kaohsiung from the mainland-friendly Kuomintang, and James Soong Chu-yu, chairman of the smaller People First Party. Y and C said they saw a subtle connection between Hong Kong and Taiwan, two places not far apart geographically, and which both use traditional Chinese characters, as opposed to the simplified figures used on the mainland. I am a Hongkonger. I have seen how Hong Kong has degenerated. Don’t give a chance to the Chinese Communist Party Banner on display in Taipei Y noted that, apart from linguistic similarities, both places are dealing with the influence of Beijing. As a result, she said, many Taiwanese students cared about the situation in Hong Kong, and six or seven had joined their concern group. In September, the group created an artwork named Lennon Ship, a model yacht about three metres long and three metres tall, made from wooden boards. Its sail bore the popular pro-democracy slogan “Revolution of our times”. Lennon Ship The students said the boat referenced the “Be water” philosophy of the Hong Kong protests and served as a movable “Lennon wall” adorned with artworks, pictures and messages of support for the anti-government movement. One of the ship’s creators was a group member who gave his name as R, who also marked China’s National Day on October 1 by organising a protest in which 60 students carried the boat up a hill on the campus. “It sounds impossible for a boat to sail onto the hilltop. But, with unity, imagination and perseverance, we succeeded. We believe the Hong Kong movement will succeed too,” he said. The Hongkonger, who is studying for a master’s in film studies, said he drew inspiration for the protest from the 1982 German film Fitzcarraldo, whose protagonist leads a group of people in moving a steamship over a steep hill in the Amazon to exploit rubber trees that are inaccessible because of the landscape. Fitzcarraldo Lennon Ship is now on display at the Museum of Contemporary Art Taipei. Lennon Ship The students were not alone in urging Taiwanese people to vote. For Taiwan’s voters, election is about more than Beijing and Washington 17 Feb 2020 For Taiwan’s voters, election is about more than Beijing and Washington 17 Feb 2020 In addition to online posters created by Hongkongers, and calls by different groups, Hong Kong actor Chapman To Man-chat posted a video message on Thursday, urging Taiwanese people to treasure, and use, the democracy they have. On Wednesday, two Hongkongers were spotted holding up a banner with a similar message on the streets of Ximending, a busy shopping district in Taipei. “I am a Hongkonger. I have seen how Hong Kong has degenerated,” the banner read. “Don’t give a chance to the Chinese Communist Party. Youngsters, please vote.” In the city on Friday night, tens of thousands attended a campaign rally for Tsai. Among a group of Hongkongers there was a youngster who gave his name as Gary, and held a black flag bearing the words “Liberate Hong Kong; Revolution of our times”. He said: “We want to tell the Taiwan voters about what is happening in Hong Kong; to not let Taiwan become the next Hong Kong.” 	SCMP

Secretary for the Civil Service Joshua Law Chi-kong revealed on Friday that dozens of government employees had been held by police for joining unlawful assemblies as of December 31, and warned they could lose their jobs if convicted by the courts. “Out of the 41 arrested, 31 have been interdicted and suspended from service,” he said. “In the event that they are convicted by the court, we will initiate disciplinary actions. The result could be sacking or warnings, depending on the severity of the punishment.” Law said the decision to suspend the arrested civil servants was made in the public interest. “We need to consider public perception if an arrested civil servant is allowed to continue to exercise the powers and functions of office,” he said. The minister did not reveal whether anyone from the disciplined forces or public education sector were among those arrested, but he stressed the number of civil servants detained for taking part in unlawful public activities only accounted for a tiny minority of the 180,000-strong government workforce.  “The majority of civil servants are conscientious in discharging their duties. Members of the public shouldn’t dismiss the loyalty of civil servants because of the arrests of a small number of government employees,” Law said. In a letter to all the city’s civil servants in November, Law cautioned that staff could face immediate suspension or other disciplinary action if they were arrested for breaking the law during protests. Hong Kong’s civil servants will be immediately suspended if arrested 15 Nov 2019 Hong Kong’s civil servants will be immediately suspended if arrested 15 Nov 2019 “Civil servants must not take part in any unlawful activities and actions, including illegal processions or assemblies,” he wrote.  Sparked by the in June, the protests have since developed into a wider anti-government movement opposing Beijing and demanding greater democracy.  wider anti-government movement  On November 2, Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily ran a strongly worded commentary warning that Hong Kong civil servants supporting the protests would “burn with the rioters”. People’s Daily Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants’ Association president Li Kwai-yin said it was a normal arrangement to suspend civil servants after they were arrested, particularly those who provided direct services to the public.   “For instance, it would affect public confidence if a social worker was arrested in connection with sexual offences,” she said, adding that the impact would depend on the severity of the offence. But Leung Chau-ting, chief executive of the Federation of Civil Service Unions, was critical of the government's decision to suspend staff before the courts could deliver their verdicts. “It violates the principle of presumption of innocence under the common law system in Hong Kong,” he said. Accusing police of mishandling the protests, he added: “It would be unfair to civil servants who might be arrested arbitrarily.” And Michael Ngan Mo-chau, chairman of the Union for New Civil Servants, which has clashed with the government over its support for the protest movement, questioned the grounds for such a crackdown. “We hope the Civil Service Bureau will provide clear guidelines for handling relevant cases,” said Ngan, who in August organised a rally against the extradition bill. Police unions fight back at bid to deny officers a pay rise 19 Dec 2019 Police unions fight back at bid to deny officers a pay rise 19 Dec 2019 Meanwhile, Legco’s finance committee voted down on Friday afternoon a motion inviting Commissioner of Police Chris Tang Ping-keung to attend its meeting and directly address questions from legislators over a funding request that would give officers a pay rise. The motion was tabled by opposition lawmaker Ted Hui Chi-fung. The pro-democracy bloc, which has accused police of using excessive force in handling anti-government protests since last June, has been asking the government to remove the force from the application for public sector pay increases. The committee, which resumed its scrutiny of the application last month, had not yet voted on the funding request when its meeting ended on Friday evening. Law said he hoped lawmakers would respect the protocol for scrutinising the annual pay rise for civil servants in one go. “It is important for us to adhere to the established mechanism,” he said.

The number was six times higher than four years ago, just after the Occupy protests had ended. Occupy protests University of Hong Kong academics, who conducted the study, urged the government to step up its mental health provisions. Their research also suggested that up to 11 per cent of the city’s adult population were affected by probable depression last year, five times higher than the figure collected from 2009 to 2014, when it was just 2 per cent. The research, published in an article in The Lancet, was the largest population-wide mental health survey – as questionnaires were sent to more than 18,000 residents aged 18 or above – as well as the longest observational one, comparing data across 10 years from 2009 to 2019. The Lancet The figures represented the equivalent of 1.9 million more adults with PTSD symptoms, and an additional 590,000 adults with probable depression compared to a decade ago.   Professor Gabriel Leung, the dean of HKU’s faculty of medicine who co-led the research, said: “Hong Kong is under-resourced to deal with this excess mental health burden.  “With only around half the per capita psychiatry capacity of the UK and pre-existing average public sector outpatient waiting times of up to 64 weeks, it is important that we enhance mental health and social care provision so that all those in need are able to access high-quality services.” The HKU research compared the findings from two initial surveys, conducted from 2009 to 2014 and involving more than 18,000 Hong Kong residents, with the results of seven more surveys, each involving between 1,200 and 1,700 adults, conducted from 2014 to November last year.    “[It] could mean an additional 1.9 million adults with PTSD symptoms,” the article said. It also found that 22 per cent of Hong Kong residents surveyed during the 2019 protests reported probable major depression or suspected PTSD. “The authors [of the study] say that this is comparable to the prevalence of mental health conditions observed following large-scale disasters, armed conflicts or terrorist attacks,” the article read. Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos Hong Kong has been embroiled in seven months of street protests, triggered by fierce opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill. The mass demonstrations have since morphed into a full-scale anti-government movement focusing on five demands that include calls for democratic reform and an independent probe into police use of force. Professor Leung warned in July about the “very concerning situation”. “This is an epidemic of mental health [issues] linked to serious societal events,” he said. Another survey released in December by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups found families divided and relationships strained as three in 10 young people in the city had reportedly quarrelled with their parents over current social issues. While fewer than half of those affected said they would seek help from health care professionals, citing a preference for self-management, seeking help from family or friends, and privacy concerns, the researchers estimated that the 2019 social unrest might be associated with an additional 140,000 adults seeking outpatient support services for depression, and roughly 360,000 adults looking for help with PTSD. The authors estimated that mental health care providers should prepare for a potential 12 per cent rise in demand for public sector services. Last month, Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Siu-chee wrote on her blog that demand for a 24-hour mental health hotline operated by the Hospital Authority had risen from about 2,000 calls a month early last year, to more than 3,000 in the last three months.

Ocean Park’s operations and entertainment executive director Timothy Ng Sau-kin said on Thursday that the new night time tourism experience Gala of Lights was a nine-figure investment. It was part-funded by a HK$310 million (US$40 million) government fund and will launch on Friday. Ng said he hoped the project would attract daytime visitors to stick around for the night show and have dinner at the park. “This can help us boost footfall and income,” he said. Almost two years in the making, visitors can enjoy two main multimedia shows at the Grand Aquarium and Aqua City Lagoon, featuring flaming jets, original music and stage performances by artists from 6.30pm to 10pm every evening.  Through light projection, revellers can enjoy a performance themed on sea nature and another focusing on Hong Kong features, including the iconic skyline of Victoria Harbour. New exclusive promotions for local residents were also unveiled as the park marks its 43rd birthday on Friday.    Visitors aged 65 or above can receive a 30 per cent off at all food kiosks and designated restaurants on top of receiving free admission. Since June, the city’s civil unrest, triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, has taken a heavy toll on local tourism.

Li Jinpeng, 36, who is unemployed and businessman Ching Wai-ming, 61, were sentenced to 12 months and 14 months in prison at Fanling Court respectively, over one joint count of possessing offensive weapons in a public place. The pair admitted carrying the petrol bombs outside Villa Sunshine in Tin Shui Wai in the early hours of August 15. The previous evening, protesters gathered outside Tin Shui Wai Police Station – about 1km from the scene – where they burned incense and shone laser beams at the building before police dispersed the crowd. Defence counsel David Boyton said the pair had merely held the bombs for a friend, but refused to say why they did so.  He said both his clients “did not think properly” before committing the offence. Man jailed for a year over possession of petrol bombs during Hong Kong protests 3 Jan 2020 Man jailed for a year over possession of petrol bombs during Hong Kong protests 3 Jan 2020 Passing sentence, acting principal magistrate Don So Man-lung set a starting point of 21 months in jail for both defendants, after finding the bombs were likely to be used to wound others, rather than cause damage to property. “There was no actual injury inflicted on people, but the potential danger cannot be ignored,” he said.  He reduced their terms by seven months to credit their guilty plea. He further awarded Li a two months reduction in consideration of his clear criminal record.  The court heard police officers arrived at the scene that morning initially to investigate a missing person, only to find four men acting suspiciously near a private car parked on a bicycle lane. The group of four fled, but three of them, including the two defendants, were subdued on the spot. The remaining one jumped into the car and made his escape, but a box dropped out of its open boot in the process. Officers found six petrol bombs in the box. The third arrestee had absconded after being granted bail by police.

On October 13 last year, the court heard she and some 20 protesters occupied Kwong Fuk Road at around 6pm, before police conducted a sweep and made arrests. Police found the bombs in her bag after restraining her. Boyton, who also represented Wong, said she pleaded guilty to the offence on the basis that she had only tried to take the offensive weapons away from the scene. He said the arrest was “unfortunate”. Magistrate So called for a background report before passing sentence on January 24. In remanding the defendant, he said: “Because of the gravity of the offence and the potential danger to society, a term of imprisonment is inevitable. It’s just a matter of how long.” But Tang Chi-lok, 21, pleaded not guilty to another count of possessing an instrument fit for unlawful purposes. He was accused of carrying a spanner, seven Allen keys, a flame gun and one can of lighter fluid. Prosecutors accepted his guilty plea on the flag charge and agreed to offer no evidence on the other count. The court heard protesters gathered outside Tuen Mun Town Hall on September 21, pulled down the national flag there and threw it on the ground. Live television footage showed, three protesters – one of whom police identified as Tang – setting the flag on fire with a flame gun, then tearing it apart and trampling on the burnt shreds. Tang was arrested that night amid an unlawful assembly in Yuen Long. Assistant director of public prosecutions Anthony Chau Tin-hang asked the court to send Tang to jail, as he had endangered some 40 people, including members of the press, who were at the scene by setting fire to the flag. His lawyer Jessica Chan Wing-yin pleaded for leniency, saying it was an out-of-character incident. She submitted three paintings drawn by her client and described him as a talented and aspiring teen widely praised by teachers and employers. Acting principal magistrate Cheung Kit-yee will sentence Tang on January 29 pending a community service report. She warned that all sentencing options remained open. 	SCMP

The World Universities Debating Championships (WUDC) was held on January 3 in Bangkok. Organisers cancelled a live stream of the event midway. About 30 mainland Chinese students and teachers who were in the audience left the venue after the motion “This House, as China, would grant universal suffrage to Hong Kong citizens” was announced, according to sources. A total of 34 mainland students from 11 universities were among about 1,000 debaters from more than 50 countries competing in the tournament. The winning team from the University of Oxford, comprising Singaporean Lee Chin Wee and Canadian Jason Xiao, also in rare fashion redacted their names from official records after the competition. They had argued against the motion.  They were among participants who requested not to have their speeches in the tournament live-streamed. Oxford beat three other teams – from Yale University, the University of Belgrade and Macquarie University, from the United States, Serbia and Australia respectively. The four finalist teams and the audience were notified of the motion about 15 minutes before the match under existing rules. ‘Not feasible to relaunch debate on universal suffrage now,’ Lam tells EU 15 Oct 2019 ‘Not feasible to relaunch debate on universal suffrage now,’ Lam tells EU 15 Oct 2019 Hong Kong students, who were also present, stayed on to listen to the debate, the sources added.  Some mainland Chinese debaters, according to one source present at the scene, also complained to the organiser about the motion.  “They believed the motion put them at political risk,” the source said. “Therefore they walked out and removed their names from [tournament records this year].” They believed the motion put them at political risk Source Similar complaints of what debaters call “equity violation” have appeared in past tournaments. In 2016, at the United States Universities Debating Championship, a participating school protested against the motion “Violence by Palestinians against Israeli civilian targets is justified”. But the event eventually went ahead as scheduled. WUDC has not responded to inquiries from the Post over the actions of mainland Chinese spectators and participants. Post Hong Kong democracy bill sponsor claims ‘significant progress’ in US Senate 14 Nov 2019 Hong Kong democracy bill sponsor claims ‘significant progress’ in US Senate 14 Nov 2019 In an earlier statement, the organiser said it had offered to redact the names of some participants and had cancelled the live stream as some debaters did not give consent. “They did so for personal and professional reasons, due to the motion calling on teams to make statements they did not feel comfortable making in a public space,” WUDC’s equity team, which handles and investigates complaints, wrote on its Facebook page. It said it did not have the power to screen motions unless adjudicators requested so, adding: “There was no involvement or pressure from any national body, embassy or official to ‘make the finals go away’.” There was no involvement or pressure from any national body, embassy or official to ‘make the finals go away’ WUDC A Hong Kong participant who declined to be identified said the organiser had redacted all names of mainland Chinese and Hong Kong teams, but reinstated some a day after the finals. Teachers from participating mainland universities approached by the Post were reluctant to respond. Among them was Professor Zhang Yafeng of Lanzhou Jiaotong University, who only pointed to the “official announcement” from organisers, declining to comment further. Post China’s embassy in Thailand has not responded to inquiries from the Post over the matter. Post Ivan Chan, who was the first debater from a Hong Kong institute to qualify for the open category of the competitive WUDC, said while some regional tournaments did provide the option of name redaction and suspension of live streams out of privacy concerns, it was unusual for WUDC to remove the recorded debate after it was partially live streamed. “WUDC’s grand finals is an educational opportunity for many young and aspiring debaters around the world,” he said. The incident came against the backdrop of anti-government protests that have roiled Hong Kong for seven months. Sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, the movement has since morphed into wider civil unrest calling for universal suffrage, among other demands, with violent clashes between radicals and police. roiled Hong Kong for seven months Additional reporting by Victor Ting Additional reporting by Victor Ting 	SCMP

Benjamin Yu SC said the lower court had failed to fully consider the public danger facing Hong Kong when it ruled the mask ban unconstitutional as a way of curbing unrest, even as radical protesters with their faces covered attacked civilians, property and police. the lower court had failed to fully consider the public danger facing Hong Kong when it ruled the Opening the two-day hearing at the Court of Appeal for the government, Yu said: “That was the daily routine in Hong Kong … Yesterday in Tseung Kwan O, we still had the same problem.” Anti-mask law in Hong Kong ruled unconstitutional by High Court 19 Nov 2019 Anti-mask law in Hong Kong ruled unconstitutional by High Court 19 Nov 2019 On Wednesday night, protesters mourned the death of student Chow Tsz-lok, who fell from a car park in unexplained circumstances last November near to a police operation. The gathering escalated into clashes with police. Chow Tsz-lok Yu acknowledged the mask ban might have left some, including sexual minorities, aggrieved because they could not wear masks to protect their identities even at lawful rallies.  But he urged three appeal judges – chief judge of the High Court Jeremy Poon Shiu-chor and Justices Johnson Lam Man-hon and Thomas Au Hing-cheung – to also consider the interests of the wider public. In November, the Court of First Instance ruled unconstitutional an anti-mask law enacted by the government in October to ban people from wearing face coverings at both lawful and unlawful rallies. Court of First Instance ruled unconstitutional  In a decision that sparked fury in Beijing, the lower court declared as unconstitutional the way in which the government had brought in the mask ban, which was done by invoking the colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance on the grounds of public danger.  The ban aimed to put an end to the increasing violence seen during months of protests, which were triggered by the government’s now-withdrawn extradition bill. But it led 24 opposition lawmakers and veteran activist “Long Hair” Leung Kwok-hung to challenge the legislation, giving rise to the present court battle.    Disagreeing with the lower court, Yu argued the anti-mask law was subsidiary legislation, a set of laws that can be made unilaterally by the government using powers previously granted to it by the legislature. As Hong Kong leader rolls out mask law, city burns during night of violence 5 Oct 2019 As Hong Kong leader rolls out mask law, city burns during night of violence 5 Oct 2019 But the court ruled the emergency law not only allowed the chief executive to make subsidiary legislation, but any laws – of unlimited scope in terms of subject matter – as long as they were desirable in times of public danger. That diminished the legislature’s role, making it incompatible with the Basic Law, the ruling found. Yu said the current administration should be allowed to use the same emergency ordinance previously available to the colonial government, because the Basic Law guaranteed the status quo despite “a change of constitutional order” when Hong Kong was handed back to China by Britain in 1997. Otherwise, it would amount to an “earth-shattering change”, he said. Anti-mask law in Hong Kong met with citywide violence Anti-mask law in Hong Kong met with citywide violence He added a preparatory committee, established in the run-up to the handover to screen out colonial laws incompatible with the Basic Law, did not take issue with the emergency ordinance. In the wake of an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus in Wuhan, central China, Yu said the anti-mask law provided a defence for those wearing masks for health reasons in public. Barrister Gladys Li SC, representing the legislators, responded saying the “evil” was in the vague wording used in the emergency law which granted the chief executive “untrammelled power”. She added laws made under the emergency regulations ordinance could not in effect be scrutinised by Legco because only the chief executive had the power to repeal it. Li will continue her arguments on Friday. At least 77 anti-mask law arrests amid Hong Kong’s ‘escalating vandalism’ 9 Oct 2019 At least 77 anti-mask law arrests amid Hong Kong’s ‘escalating vandalism’ 9 Oct 2019 Before the hearing, pro-democracy legislator Dennis Kwok, who led the judicial challenge, called on the government to withdraw the appeal. “We hope the government would understand the anti-mask law has no use whatsoever to resolve the disputes Hong Kong is experiencing right now,” he said. He added the government’s persistence would only lead to deeper social conflicts and urged the administration to let the law “die a natural death”. 	SCMP

In its annual report, the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) said it had observed a further erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy and fundamental freedoms under the “one country, two systems” framework. “Chinese government influence over the territory, and Hong Kong officials’ willingness to comply with the interests of the Chinese government, continued an accelerated trend of decreased autonomy observed in recent years,” the report said. But a government spokesman disputed that, and said the city had seen “Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong” since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, and had enjoyed a high degree of autonomy. “The one country, two systems principle has been fully and successfully implemented. The Hong Kong government will continue to implement the principle resolutely in accordance with the Basic Law,” the spokesman said. US President Donald Trump signs Hong Kong human rights bills into law US President Donald Trump signs Hong Kong human rights bills into law On Wednesday, Congress urged the White House to warn Chinese and Hong Kong officials that the erosion of the city’s autonomy would threaten its special status under United States law.  Lawmakers also accused Beijing of employing disinformation and censorship in an attempt to “shape reporting” on the anti-government protests in the city, and attribute the movement to influence by foreign forces. The commission called on President Donald Trump’s administration to fully enact the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to monitor the state of the city’s autonomy, punish human rights violators and reaffirm the US government’s support for democracy in Hong Kong.  Beijing has said the legislation was an interference in its domestic affairs, while the Hong Kong government said the legislation was “unwarranted, sends an erroneous signal to violent protesters and harms the relations and common interests between Hong Kong and the US.” Donald Trump signs Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act into law 28 Nov 2019 Donald Trump signs Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act into law 28 Nov 2019 The commission said the trend of decreased autonomy had implications for both the protection of the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong, and for the future of US policy towards the city, which is based on its continued autonomy.  Hong Kong police’s use of force during the anti-government protests contravened international standards, the commission said. “The Chinese central government employed propaganda, disinformation, and censorship in an apparent attempt to shape reporting on the Hong Kong protests, attributing the protests to influence by ‘‘foreign forces,’’ the report said. In the wide-ranging report, the CECC also called on the Trump administration to make Beijing’s human rights record a cornerstone of all interactions with China – including negotiations over trade. The report found that Beijing’s human rights record deteriorated in a number of areas during the 2019 reporting year – which ran from August 2018 to August 2019 – among them freedom of the press. That year saw the continuation of a crackdown against amateur journalism, the CECC said, citing the cases of three well-known “citizen journalists”, who were handed combined jail sentences of 21 years on charges relating to the subversion of state power. The commission devoted about 25 of its 323 pages to the mass internment of Uygurs and other largely Muslim ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, where it said detainees were subject to mistreatment, forced labour and political indoctrination. The report also said the Hong Kong government had prosecuted and sentenced pro-democracy leaders in the 2014 Occupy movement, and disqualified and removed pro-democracy legislators from office. Economist Larry Summers says phase-one deal unlikely to resolve issues behind US-China trade war Economist Larry Summers says phase-one deal unlikely to resolve issues behind US-China trade war The commission recommended the US administration emphasise in meetings with Beijing and Hong Kong officials that any change in circumstances could see the city lose the special status it enjoys under US law. Under the terms of the US-Hong Kong Policy Act, the city is treated differently from the rest of China in terms of trade, diplomacy and politics. That status has provided much-needed shelter for Hong Kong from the tit-for-tat tariffs Washington and Beijing have levied on each other. The report also urged the Chinese and Hong Kong governments to restart the electoral reform process and work towards attaining universal suffrage in the city. A spokesman for the Office of the Commissioner of the Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong rejected the US congress report as “talking black into white”, “distorting the truth”, and a brutal interference with the city’s and Chinese domestic affairs. The spokesman said the report was full of absurd and groundless claims, filled with “ignorance, prejudice and arrogance”. The spokesman said “one country, two systems”, “Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong”, and high degree of autonomy principles had been implemented comprehensively in the city and it was “internationally recognised”. The spokesman also defended the police handling of protests, saying officers had carried out their duties with dedication. The spokesman said US politicians should look at the way their own police officers enforced the law and their own country’s “geopolitical bullying”, making it the least qualified to comment on Hong Kong police and affairs. The spokesman also said the US report was further evidence that the US was interfering in Hong Kong affairs.

Luo Huining, who replaced Wang Zhimin as director of the central government’s liaison office, set out four tasks for Lam to do more and do better, in their first official meeting since the surprise reshuffle was announced last weekend. replaced Wang Zhimin He called on Lam to further ensure that the “one country, two systems” principle for governing Hong Kong would continue to guide the city’s progress, do more to end the violence, further improve the economy and people’s livelihood, and further strengthen communication in handling the city’s problems.

Luo met Lam for about 1½ hours at Government House, her official residence, amid speculation that Beijing was signalling a change in its policy on the city as Lam’s government struggled to restore order and end the social unrest triggered by her now-withdrawn extradition bill.  “Both sides mentioned the need to fulfil the central government’s demands to further implement the ‘one country, two systems’ principle to maintain Hong Kong’s long-term prosperity and stability, and further suppress violence and chaos,” a statement issued by Luo’s office read. “[They also talked about] further developing the economy, improving people’s livelihood … and further strengthening communication and cooperation. “Both sides deeply believe that with the central government’s high-level of concern and care, the firm backing of the strong motherland, and the joint efforts of all sectors of society, Hong Kong can get back on track.”  A separate statement issued by Lam's office said the chief executive had pledged during the meeting that her government would “spare no effort to curb violence and uphold the rule of law to find a way out of the current impasse”. Thursday’s meeting came a day after Luo visited neighbouring Shenzhen, where he held talks with the leaders of the mainland Chinese city, including party chief Wang Weizhong and mayor Chen Rugui.  They agreed to “unswervingly” adhere to the one country, two systems principle for Hong Kong, and to accelerate cooperation in areas such as the Greater Bay Area plan to turn Hong Kong, Macau and nine other Chinese cities into an economic powerhouse to rival Silicon Valley. State media did not explain the reasons for Luo’s appointment when the news broke last Saturday, but sources have suggested Wang’s departure was sparked by the humiliating defeat of the pro-Beijing camp by opposition rivals in last November’s district council elections. Wang has taken up a new posting as deputy chief at the Beijing-based Central Institute for Party History and Literature Research. November’s district council elections Professor Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, a Beijing-based, semi-official think tank, said that in choosing Luo, a former Communist Party leader of Shanxi province with a strong reputation as a troubleshooter and an enforcer, the central government was signalling that it wanted the liaison office to have a “stronger presence” in the city. “In the past, the liaison office might have been more of a PR office of the central government, or a messenger. Now, it will play more of a role as the representative office of Beijing in Hong Kong,” Lau said. Beijing’s new Hong Kong envoy Luo Huining was a surprise choice.

But Secretary for Labour and Welfare Law Chi-kwong’s proposal was not put to a vote on Thursday as a Legislative Council meeting was adjourned due to a lack of quorum. The Employment (Amendment) Bill 2019, which was first floated in Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s policy address in 2018, would extend maternity leave from 10 to 14 weeks. Law raised eyebrows on Thursday by launching a motion in Legco to have the bill passed on to the manpower panel, instead of the House Committee for its usual scrutiny after moving it for the first and second reading. Pan-democrats have left the committee in deadlock after refusing to elect a chairman, stalling several pieces of legislation in the process.  “The government earnestly hopes that the amendment can be passed by the end of this legislative session,” Law said. A bill is supposed to be referred to the House Committee, or a bills committee set up by the former, to allow lawmakers more time to study it before resuming its debate at a council meeting. Law said given the urgency of the bill, it should be handled by the panel, which would then submit further suggestions to the council.  While most lawmakers supported the amendments, individual legislators in the business sector expressed reservations.  Law’s motion came after Legco president Andrew Leung Kwan-yuen earlier on Thursday shot down a similar proposal by pro-government and unionist lawmaker Ho Kai-ming, on the grounds there was a lack of consensus on the urgency of the matter. Ho, of the Federation of Trade Unions (FTU), moved a motion to not send the bill to the House Committee, which he described as being in a state of “paralysis”. But Leung ruled against Ho’s motion, and said there was no extensive consensus on the urgency of the matter after consulting lawmakers and relevant government officials, including Law. “To not send a bill to the House Committee, a very high bar must be met,” Leung said.  During the short discussion that followed, pan-democrats said allowing Law’s motion would set a bad precedent for having bills passed without the House Committee’s scrutiny. “The government and pro-establishment camp lawmakers are playing tricks,” Civic Party lawmaker Kwok Ka-ki said. “If the government was serious about [the bill], they would not have presented it in January 2020. There was plenty of time last year.” The government and pro-establishment camp lawmakers are playing tricks Kwok Ka-ki, Civic Party lawmaker The meeting came to an end after People Power lawmaker and pan-democrat Ray Chan Chi-chuen requested a quorum call. According to Legco records, 27 pro-government lawmakers were present before the meeting was adjourned at 2.56pm, shy of the 35 required for quorum. Speaking after the meeting, pro-government lawmakers slammed their opponents for causing the adjournment. Beijing loyalist Martin Liao Cheung-kong said his camp had “no option” but to support Law’s motion, given that the House Committee was not functioning normally. But Civic Party’s Tanya Chan, convenor of pro-democracy bloc, warned that the proposal could pave the way for the government to fast-track other unpopular bills, including the contentious national security legislation. Legco will resume its full council meeting next Wednesday. Why maternity leave in Hong Kong still has a long way to go 16 Oct 2018 Why maternity leave in Hong Kong still has a long way to go 16 Oct 2018 Separately, city leader Lam called on lawmakers to “show mercy” and pass the amendments before the summer recess. “Whether more than 20,000 working mothers every year can enjoy four more weeks of maternity leave seems to depend on whether [pro-democracy camp] lawmakers will ‘show mercy’ and stop obstructing the council from electing a House Committee chairman,” Lam posted on Facebook at midnight on Wednesday, ahead of the meeting.

During a Legislative Council meeting on Wednesday, constitutional affairs minister Patrick Nip Tak-kuen said the government would consult lawmakers over the amendment to the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance at a panel meeting on January 23. “Personal information has been weaponised, so we and the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data have to study how to amend the ordinance to handle these cases more effectively,” Nip said. He said the commissioner’s office had made a series of suggestions on how to give the statutory body more power. They included granting it the power to have social media platforms and other websites remove certain posts, to conduct criminal investigations, and even to launch prosecutions over the misuse of personal information, he added. The commissioner’s office has for years been mocked as a “toothless tiger”, for its lack of power to conduct criminal investigations. It can only pass complaints to the police, if it deems that necessary, with any prosecution launched by the Department of Justice. Nip noted that countries such as Singapore have laws against doxxing, adding that authorities would study foreign legal situations, formulate the amendments and consult relevant stakeholders.  “The factors involved are the legal considerations with regulating doxxing, such as the definition of the crime and how to strike a balance between privacy, freedom of speech and the flow of information,” Nip said of the incoming amendments. About 30 per cent of recent doxxing cases concerned government and police supporters, while about 10 per cent were filed by people who opposed the government, he said, citing data updated at the end of 2019. Lam calls doxxing a threat to society after personal details appear online 22 Dec 2019 Lam calls doxxing a threat to society after personal details appear online 22 Dec 2019   Separately, Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data Stephen Wong Kai-yi said the number of doxxing complaints received by his office had declined recently, though the latest figure had topped 4,700.  “We made great efforts in tracking down the doxxers and requesting that social platforms assist,” Wong said. He added that his office had written to about 16 websites and platforms to request “intimidating messages” be removed. “About 70 per cent of the links were removed,” he said. In a statement on Friday, Wong defended his decision to actively probe the case involving a police officer showing the Hong Kong ID card of a reporter live on camera last month. Wong said what the officer had done was not exempted under the ordinance, and that it was the commissioner’s duty to investigate the alleged misuse of personal information. His statement was in response to a letter from a member of public, who had accused Wong of enforcing the law selectively and being “yellow to the core”, a reference to the colour which symbolises the pro-democracy movement.

Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung said on Wednesday that comments made on social media platforms involved professional conduct as they may reflect the moral values teachers held. He also dismissed claims that teachers’ freedoms were being restricted. At least 80 teachers and teaching assistants have been arrested during anti-government protests that have gripped Hong Kong since June, while students made up nearly 40 per cent of the more than 6,000 people detained. Yeung has been under mounting pressure from the pro-Beijing camp to do more to regulate the city’s educators. anti-government protests At a Legislative Council meeting on Wednesday, Yeung said: “I must emphasise that [regulating teachers’ remarks on social media] is not a restriction on their rights to express their political views or comment on social issues … but freedom of speech is not without restrictions, and should be exercised lawfully and reasonably.” Teachers must adhere to the Code for the Education Profession of Hong Kong while the control of schools and teaching therein are covered by the Education Ordinance. Latest figures from the Education Bureau showed it received 123 protest-related complaints against teachers between June and November with wrongdoing confirmed in 13 cases. At least two teachers have been suspended after complaints or being arrested.  Yeung said most of the complaints involved teachers’ inappropriate remarks on social media, including hate speech, cursing or provoking violence, foul language or insulting others. Hong Kong protesters got training from foreign forces, security chief says 9 Jan 2020 Hong Kong protesters got training from foreign forces, security chief says 9 Jan 2020 He also reiterated that schools, out of concern for students’ safety, should consider suspending teachers arrested for serious crimes such as arson or rioting even if they had not been charged. Meanwhile, the city’s largest teachers’ union announced it had set up a fund to support those who had been “unreasonably suspended or sacked” over protest-related complaints.   Union president Fung Wai-wah said it was necessary to set up the fund so people and other educators could show solidarity with teachers. He expected the money raised would reach “millions or tens of million” although he did not have a specific target.  “When teachers are suspended, they will be left without pay, so their livelihood will be affected,” Fung said. Fundraising platform Spark Alliance, which supported protesters, had HK$70 million frozen in a corporate account last month after police suspected the money was being used for personal gain and other illegal activities. HK$70 million frozen   Fung said the new fund would fulfil the necessary requirements to operate legally. He said its bank account had been used before to raise funds to support union members. But one educator who had faced protest-related complaints said he expected that few teachers would be willing to pursue legal action. He said teachers could appeal to the government over wrongdoing findings, while filing a legal challenge would be a last resort. 	SCMP

Lee made the disclosure on Wednesday when responding to lawmakers’ questions on the police’s power to access the contents of mobile phones without the owners’ consent or knowledge. “From June to November 2019, police processed 1,429 cases that involved mobile phones as evidence,” Lee told the Legislative Council meeting. “Among those cases, 3,721 mobile phones belonging to arrested persons or suspects were involved, and the relevant cases were all processed with search warrants issued by the court.” Lee said the seizure of phones was usual practice and not meant only to tackle those arrested during the social unrest, which broke out last June. social unrest  “While carrying out their responsibilities, [law enforcement agencies] may exercise the search and seizure powers conferred by relevant legislation, and seize and examine various objects of the suspected offence, including mobile phones and other similar devices,” he said. Hong Kong protesters got training from foreign forces, security chief says 9 Jan 2020 Hong Kong protesters got training from foreign forces, security chief says 9 Jan 2020 “Police will only conduct digital forensic examination on mobile phones after obtaining court warrants. The examination and the evidence obtained will be adduced in the relevant open trials.” Concerns were raised last month after pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung, who was arrested in August in connection with a protest in June, questioned whether police had abused their power to hack into his password-protected mobile phone after the prosecution admitted as evidence some instant messaging records. Wong said he had not disclosed the phone’s password to police.  Police later clarified that the procedure was conducted under a magistrate-issued search warrant.  At Wednesday’s Legco meeting, Lee would not comment on whether police used spyware to unlock suspects’ phones. “As the critical technologies used in the examinations are confidential, disclosing such information may reveal to criminals details of operations, thus allowing them to take advantage by undermining [law enforcement agencies’] capabilities in combating serious crimes and maintaining public safety.” Man who threatened Hong Kong protesters with knife jailed 8 Jan 2020 Man who threatened Hong Kong protesters with knife jailed 8 Jan 2020 Lee also cited a 2017 case in which the court ruled that under the Police Force Ordinance, officers may seize mobile phones found on an apprehended person, but would need a warrant to examine the contents in a non-emergency situation. The case stemmed from the arrest of a truck driver for the Civil Human Rights Front, who was held for not following police orders when he was leading the annual July 1 march in 2014. Opposition lawmaker Charles Mok said he was shocked by Lee’s disclosure and called for more guidelines to prevent possible abuse. “We are talking about 3,700-odd phones. That is a very big number. So far, police have arrested 6,000-odd people [in connection with the protests],” Mok said. “You break into the phones and read the contents, all contents, whether they are related to the cases being investigated or not. And no one will even know if the phones will be installed with spyware after being seized by officers.” HK$65 million bill for repairs on public facilities wrecked by radicals 8 Jan 2020 HK$65 million bill for repairs on public facilities wrecked by radicals 8 Jan 2020 Mok’s views, meanwhile, were echoed by Icarus Wong Ho-yin, spokesman for concern group Civil Rights Observer. “It seems to me that it has now become a casual procedure that officers will seize an arrestee’s phone and check the contents,” Wong said, adding that the risk of possible abuse was rising as police had recently resorted to making mass arrests. “We have heard of cases where officers threatened a person who was stopped on the street for questioning to hand over and unlock his phone to check the contents, or else risk being arrested. Usually, the person will give in.” 	SCMP

John Lee Ka-chiu became the first top official to go beyond speculation about the involvement of foreign forces to cite intelligence and the well-planned nature of the protests in making the allegation. He said there was no evidence linking a recent, protest-related spate of weapon and bomb seizures by police to overseas terrorist organisations, but suggested some protesters were not acting on their own. Lee also revealed police had seized 3,721 mobile phones from protesters in the first five months of unrest and had them broken into to read the contents. Responding to a pro-establishment lawmaker’s question in the Legislative Council on Wednesday, the secretary for security said: “Based on the rioters’ acts, we definitely believe they received training.” He did not name any organisation or individual, but said the assessment was based on the government’s investigation and intelligence concerning “how [protesters] were organised” and “the different versions and angles of promotional materials they have”.  “It seems that in every operation or incident, they will plan in advance with a deliberate plot in a syndicated manner,” Lee said. “In terms of resources and mobilisation, we don’t believe that a handful of unorganised rioters could orchestrate such events.” Nobody should believe Lee’s empty accusation until he can prove his claims Alvin Yeung, Civic Party leader Lee added that online news had also indicated overseas groups were training individuals to join the movement. Civic Party leader Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu said it was extremely irresponsible for Lee to make such accusations without proof.    “Nobody should believe Lee’s empty accusation until he can prove his claims,” Yeung said. Pro-democracy lawmaker Kenneth Leung, of the Professionals Guild, accused Lee of making “irresponsible and serious accusations” without evidence. “I can’t see why creativity demonstrated by protesters has to be linked to overseas training,” he said. Man who threatened Hong Kong protesters with knife jailed 8 Jan 2020 Man who threatened Hong Kong protesters with knife jailed 8 Jan 2020 But pro-Beijing lawmaker Wong Kwok-kin, who is also an adviser to the city’s leader in the Executive Council, backed Lee. Wong said he was convinced it would be impossible for protests to roll on for months without foreign manipulation. Lee revealed in the same meeting that police had processed mobile phones belonging to arrested protesters from June to November with search warrants issued by the courts. “Police will only conduct a digital forensic examination on mobile phones after obtaining court warrants,” he said, dismissing concerns about abuse of power. Activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung – who was arrested in August in connection with a protest in June – had questioned whether police abused their power by hacking into his mobile phone. He found that some instant messaging records from his locked phone had been admitted as evidence by the prosecution. Wong said in December he had not given up his password during his arrest. Police clarified that it was conducted under a magistrate-issued search warrant. Opposition lawmaker Charles Mok called for more guidelines to prevent possible abuse. “We are talking about [a lot of] phones,” Mok said. “You break into the phones and read the contents, all contents, whether they are related to the cases being investigated or not. And no one can know if the phones will have spyware installed after being seized.” Icarus Wong Ho-yin, a spokesman for Civil Rights Observer, a concern group, agreed. “It seems it has now become a casual procedure that officers will seize an arrestee’s phone and check its contents,” he said. Dozens detained by police after march against parallel traders in Hong Kong’s Sheung Shui Dozens detained by police after march against parallel traders in Hong Kong’s Sheung Shui He added the risk of possible abuse was getting higher as police had resorted to making mass arrests recently. “We have heard of cases of officers threatening people stopped on the street for questioning to hand over and unlock their phones for officers to check the contents, risking arrest if they do not comply,” Wong said. Meanwhile, the government rejected a suggestion by the pro-Beijing camp to introduce legislation to stop demonstrators from “disguising themselves as online media workers” to make it easier for them to carry out illegal acts. Secretary for Home Affairs Lau Kong-wah said that, despite suspected cases of protesters impersonating reporters and participating in illegal and violent acts, the government would not define what constituted a media worker with legislation and had no intention of screening journalists’ qualifications to report.

A dozen black-clad protesters laid bricks and other large items on the road outside a car park in the estate where the vigil took place.

Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po estimated the budget deficit would amount to about HK$80 billion (US$10.2 billion), based on a gross domestic product in the region of HK$2 trillion for the year to the end of March. His forecast was underlined by pessimism among industry experts. Chan said a deficit of that size, a reversal from the government’s previous forecast of a HK$16.8 billion surplus, was acceptable by international standards. The city has been reeling from a double blow of the US-China trade war and ongoing social turmoil. While the tariff spat has been running since before 2019, anti-government protests have added to the economic headwinds since June. Chan earlier downgraded the GDP forecast from 0-1 per cent growth in 2019 to a contraction of 1.3 per cent – the first economic shrinkage in a decade – on the back of weakened exports, slumping tourism numbers, shrinking retail sales and rising unemployment.  But the International Monetary Fund warned last month that GDP could decline by as much as 1.9 per cent in 2019. The government has since August splashed HK$25 billion on measures intended to ease the economic woes, which were unexpected when it compiled its surplus forecast early last year.  In the run-up to his budget speech, expected in February, Chan hinted on Wednesday that cash giveaways for the general public were unlikely. Carrie Lam insists she will remain in office to tackle challenges in Hong Kong 8 Jan 2020 Carrie Lam insists she will remain in office to tackle challenges in Hong Kong 8 Jan 2020 “There are suggestions the government should distribute HK$10,000 to each person, this will easily cost HK$60 billion to HK$70 billion. The ultimate sum could exceed HK$100 billion if the estimated deficit is taken into consideration,” he said. “There are many credit-rating agencies and think tanks scrutinising our ranking. If our ranking is affected negatively, there will be implications for corporate borrowing.”  He said the city’s foreign currency reserves, which totalled US$441.3 billion by the end of December, were strong enough to guard against overseas turmoil. “We have closely monitored the stock market and foreign exchanges, futures and derivatives trading and haven’t seen any abnormal movements,” he said. Still, tourism and retail industry experts expected the lacklustre performance to linger in 2020. The gradual restoration of social stability locally, as well as smooth progress of the Sino-US trade negotiations, will help support the slow recovery of the consumer market in Hong Kong Michael Cheng, PwC Hong Kong Retail Management Association chairwoman Annie Tse Yau On-yee said retail sales in the first half of this year were projected to plummet sharply year on year, and the percentage decrease could be a double-digit figure due to a high base of comparison from early 2019. Tse expected business performance in January to be similar to December – when she observed a slight improvement – thanks to a brief boost brought by the Lunar New Year holiday, from January 25 to 28. On a more optimistic note, international advisory firm PwC said the slump in the luxury market was likely to have bottomed out in 2019, while sales of gold and jewellery products were expected to surge during Lunar New Year because, according to Chinese tradition, the Year of the Rat is a good time for marriage. Michael Cheng Woon-yin, PwC’s Asia Pacific, mainland China and Hong Kong consumer markets leader, cautioned that the overall retail business in January would still be worse than in previous years. But he said the performance would still be better than the previous two months. US, China and the ""doomsday scenario"" for the global trading system US, China and the ""doomsday scenario"" for the global trading system He predicted overall 2020 retail sales would fall about 2.5 per cent year on year, to HK$420 billion. In the first 11 months of 2019, retail sales were down 11.4 per cent year on year, according to the latest government statistics. PwC’s projections took into account wider challenges such as a slowing Chinese economy and volatility in global markets against the backdrop of the US presidential election in November, he said. “The gradual restoration of social stability locally, as well as smooth progress of the Sino-US trade negotiations, will help support the slow recovery of the consumer market in Hong Kong,” he said. Protest-hit Hong Kong’s economy shrank 1.9 per cent, IMF forecasts 30 Dec 2019 Protest-hit Hong Kong’s economy shrank 1.9 per cent, IMF forecasts 30 Dec 2019 On Hong Kong tourism, Travel Industry Council chairman Jason Wong Chun-tat said the number of mainland tour groups coming to the city was down 90 per cent in recent months and the numbers for January had not improved much. Bookings for outbound travel around Lunar New Year were 20 to 30 per cent down on 2019, he added. With social tensions eased slightly in recent months, Wong said he hoped more tourists could be attracted to the city by discount offers and promotional efforts. Bank of China (Hong Kong)’s chief economist Zhihuan E said there was still a chance the city’s economy would stabilise or even bounce back slightly this year, if the unrest could be resolved. "	SCMP

West Kowloon Court heard Choi Pei-tak, 45, intimidated about 20 black-clad protesters by pointing and waving a 15cm blade at them at around 6pm outside Yat Tung Estate bus terminus in Tung Chung on September 1. That day, protesters had blocked roads and vandalised the railway station in the northern Lantau Island town, paralysing traffic to the airport. Choi, a transport worker and local resident, initially denied one count of possessing an offensive weapon in a public place, but opted to plead guilty just before his trial. The offence carries a maximum prison term of three years. Anti-government protesters create turbulence at Hong Kong airport Anti-government protesters create turbulence at Hong Kong airport Magistrate Winnie Lau Yee-wan said the defendant’s act was an apparent threat to public safety, which guaranteed a deterrent sentence. “It was sheer luck that no one was injured,” she said. “The defendant should have made a police report, instead of carrying a weapon and resorting to violence.” The defendant should have made a police report, instead of carrying a weapon and resorting to violence Magistrate Winnie Lau She said that in a video widely shared online, the defendant, wearing white, was seen clutching the knife in his right hand and chasing protesters for about five seconds. The knife was not sheathed, and some protesters threw bottles and shouted at the defendant.  Defence counsel Lawrence Ng Yeung-yin said in mitigation his client was angered after witnessing his friend’s wife being harassed by protesters following a dispute. He said Choi’s family felt threatened when, on September 23, a wall outside his home was painted with graffiti reading: “Here lives a murderer, a knife-wielding man.”  Ng also claimed the defendant had tried to turn himself in before he was arrested, but was told at Lantau North Police Station that he did not need to surrender “for the time being”.  But prosecutor Francis Yip Kim-ming said his team had been unable to find any officer at the station who talked to Choi and could confirm whether such a conversation took place. Ng later withdrew this claim. In sentencing Choi, the magistrate imposed a starting point of 15 months in jail, but reduced it by five months to credit his guilty plea. She granted a further reduction of one month, as she found that the defendant appeared truly remorseful and brave to accept liability for his crime. As it happened: Hong Kong airport protesters go on rampage in MTR station 2 Sep 2019 As it happened: Hong Kong airport protesters go on rampage in MTR station 2 Sep 2019 Separately, police on Tuesday arrested five Hong Kong men in connection with a firebomb attack at Kowloon Tong railway station in October. Investigations showed a masked pair had hurled two petrol bombs into the MTR station and fled in two getaway cars just before 2.30pm on October 12. Two turnstiles were damaged in the incident. There was no protest in the area at the time but an anti-government rally was being held in Tsim Sha Tsui. After combing through security camera footage, police identified the suspects. Officers from Kowloon West regional crime unit arrested five men aged from 26 to 40 in a series of raids across the city on Tuesday. Four of them, including deliveryman Tsang Yu-sang, 26, IT technician Cheng Wai-sum, 33, and businessmen Wong Hon-wai and Wong Kam-faat, aged 30 and 40 respectively, were charged in Kowloon City Court on Wednesday afternoon. They faced a joint count of conspiracy to commit arson. Tsang was additionally charged with possession of offensive weapons, possession of imitation firearms and possession of an instrument fit for unlawful purposes. Court documents showed that officers seized five petrol bombs, two air guns, two foldable knives, five crowbars and three hammers in his home in Sau Mau Ping. Acting principal magistrate Ada Yim Shun-yee adjourned the case to March 2 pending further police inquiries, including examination of the exhibits and a fingerprint analysis. She ordered that Tsang be remanded in custody after prosecutors objected to his bail, but granted bail of HK$100,000 to Wong Hon-wai, and bail of HK$10,000 each to the other two men on condition they stay in Hong Kong and report to police three times a week.

In a written reply to the Legislative Council, Secretary for Transport and Housing Frank Chan Fan said that from June to December last year, 740 sets of traffic lights across the city were vandalised or tampered with, while 52.8km of railings along walkways and about 21,800 square metres of paving blocks on footpaths were removed. Protesters often use railings as roadblocks and dig up bricks to use as projectiles in clashes with police. Hong Kong has been rocked by protests since June, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, but the campaign has grown into a wider anti-government movement. Chan said the vandalism of traffic lights mostly involved the cutting of cables or blackening of their surfaces. In some cases, components within the installations, as well as traffic signal control boxes, were damaged. Among the wrecked traffic facilities, 365 sets of lights were vandalised more than once, with the cumulative total of such acts reaching a high of 1,590.  “Violent protesters extensively vandalised road safety facilities and maliciously blocked roads to paralyse traffic. Such acts not only caused a serious impact on public transport and created difficulties for commuters, but also posed a potential risk to road users,” Chan said. Violent protesters extensively vandalised road safety facilities and maliciously blocked roads to paralyse traffic Frank Chan, transport minister He said the bill for fixing the damaged traffic lights would amount to HK$40 million while the cost of repair or replacement of vandalised road facilities would be about HK$25 million, giving a total of HK$65 million. Among the 18 districts, Yau Tsim Mong stood out as the most protest-damaged, with 121 damaged sets of traffic lights and 9,900 square metres of paving slabs dug up.  The transport minister said all traffic lights vandalised during the period were repaired by January 2, while most of the damaged footpaths had been fixed, adding that the Highways Department would strengthen paving blocks with new materials.

Amid the unrest, MTR facilities were also frequent targets of radicals who set fire to station entrances and smashed ticketing machines. Earlier reports put the repairs for the city’s rail operator – in which the government is a majority shareholder – at HK$500 million. 	SCMP

Beijing’s new top envoy Shenzhen Satellite TV reported that Shenzhen’s top officials, including party chief Wang Weizhong and mayor Chen Rugui, on Wednesday met Luo Huining, who took over from Wang Zhimin as director of the central government’s liaison office in Hong Kong on Saturday. Also at the meeting were Luo’s five deputy directors, Xie Feng, the Hong Kong commissioner of Beijing’s foreign ministry, and some other Shenzhen officials. The two sides agreed that they had to “unswervingly” implement Beijing’s “one country, two systems” governing principle on Hong Kong, and push forward the two cities’ cooperation on areas such as trade, entrepreneurship and the Greater Bay Area plan to turn Hong Kong, Shenzhen and nine other cities into an innovation powerhouse. The meeting came as a source told the Post that Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor was scheduled to meet Luo at Government House, her official residence, on Thursday afternoon. Post  Luo is unlikely to be accompanied by his deputies at the meeting. While the meeting on Thursday is seen as a courtesy call with the agenda yet to be finalised, the source said both officials were expected to discuss the situation in a city roiled by seven months of often-violent anti-government protests. Eric Chan Kwok-ki, director of the Chief Executive’s Office, will also attend the session.  New People’s Party chairwoman Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, a pro-establishment lawmaker, said she hoped Lam would share views on how mainland authorities could offer support amid the social unrest.  “They could discuss solutions to turn the situation round in Hong Kong through an economic approach, such as boosting integration with mainland cities,” she said. Pro-Beijing lawmaker Ma Fung-Kwok, also a Hong Kong deputy to the National People’s Congress, suggested that such meetings could be more frequent to enhance communication. He said if he had a chance to exchange views with Luo at an expected reception next week by the liaison office, he would point out citizens’ concerns over curbing protest violence.  “The office’s interference with our domestic affairs had been stark under the leadership of Wang,” he said. “It’s time to rectify the mistake by calling off the meeting.” On September 28, 2017, Lam met Wang Zhimin at Government House six days after he took up the post. In those talks, she said she hoped the liaison office would continue to help promote cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland. Speaking to the media on Monday, Luo said he hoped the city would “get back on track” after months of civil unrest, and that the “one country, two systems” formula would offer the best advantages. “get back on track” On Tuesday Lam expressed confidence in working with Luo, adding she would remain in office to help weather public health and economic storms when asked if she was concerned Beijing would replace her after changing its top representative in Hong Kong. remain in office Beijing’s new Hong Kong envoy Luo Huining was a surprise choice.

Many of them say they have been getting that message for many years. What drove home the point in the latter half of 2019 was the violence between pro-Beijing groups and protesters, as well as the vandalism against companies, banks and retail outlets with business links to mainland China – or even those using advertisements containing mainland film or music stars. Shoppers from across the border have also faced abuse and harassment. with business links to mainland China In the 23 years since Hong Kong returned to China’s control from Britain, hundreds of thousands of mainland Chinese have moved to the city because of family ties, mixed in with waves of those seeking better education, jobs and other opportunities. Many have assimilated, but can be identified by family name, accent or by speaking the Mandarin language commonly used in mainland China, while Cantonese is spoken in Hong Kong. Cantonese Mainland drifters A more recent wave of arrivals from the mainland are educated young professionals, referred to as gangpiao in Mandarin, which translates roughly as “drifters” to show they don’t have roots in Hong Kong. gangpiao There is no official data on the number of gangpiao, but a Hong Kong census in mid-2016 indicated about 77,000 China nationals fit the demographic – they had lived for several years in the city, around 80 per cent were aged between 18 and 30, and more than 60 per cent held postgraduate qualifications. In other words, just the sort of fresh talent Hong Kong needs to attract as its own population ages, but is now in danger of losing. gangpiao Many of the gangpiao – such as David Feng, a PhD student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) – came to the city seeking opportunity; also drawn by shared culture and a social tolerance. Those attractions faded fast in the anger and tear gas that characterised Hong Kong in the second half of last year. gangpiao  “My heart aches and I am really disappointed to see the city descend into a place that’s highly politicised and not suitable for study and research any more,” said Feng, who started his doctoral studies from September in computer science. Hong Kong was once a place where people got along regardless of place of origin, he said.   “I never imagined that I would encounter this in China’s own territory,” said Feng, who added he doesn’t see much of a future in the city post-graduation, which isn’t good news for the economy. When Hong Kong returned to China’s sovereignty in 1997, the city’s gross domestic product was the equivalent of 16 per cent of China’s, according to a report from the Council on Foreign Relations, a US think tank, issued in September. By 2017, the figure had fallen to 3 per cent, one marker of the astonishing economic expansion that saw China overtake Japan as the world’s second largest economy, after the US, in 2010. Hong Kong returned to China’s sovereignty  Another marker is jobs. China’s government claims to have created about 13 million new jobs in urban areas each year on average over the last five years and kept unemployment largely under control at around 5 per cent, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics. In the first 10 months of 2019, China created 11.93 million new urban jobs across the country, while the unemployment rate in urban areas dropped 0.1 percentage points to 5.1 per cent in October, mainly due to the improving employment for graduates. ‘Feeling unsafe’ For drifters feeling fearful on Hong Kong’s streets, expanded opportunities at home and abroad are creating a trend where some are giving up on the city, said Zhu Jie, a Hong Kong affairs expert at Wuhan University in central Hubei province.

Without enough communication and exchange, misunderstandings are bound to arise Zhu Jie, Hong Kong affairs expert at Wuhan University “The loss of those people is like a bridge broken between China’s mainland and Hong Kong,” Zhu said. “It has damaged relations as the anti-Chinese acts in the past months have severely eroded trust between the two sides,” he said. “Without enough communication and exchange, misunderstandings are bound to arise, which will fuel nationalist sentiments in both the mainland and Hong Kong and make it more difficult to solve problems.” Hongkongers living in mainland China say safety and friendships are on the line 17 Dec 2019 Hongkongers living in mainland China say safety and friendships are on the line 17 Dec 2019 Other professionals from mainland China in Hong Kong don’t see going back home as the only option.

She said she lived in the Tung Chung area on Lantau Island near the Hong Kong airport, but relations with locals were turning increasingly frosty. turning increasingly frosty “I started to feel unsafe,” Zhang said. “Then the mass sit-in at the Hong Kong airport in September severely disrupted my work and life and made me determined to leave,” she said.

It’s like a wound, even after it heals, it will leave a scar,” said Zhang, who added that the move to Toulouse meant she gave up her own job and now looks after her family. Postgraduate David Feng also left Hong Kong, but that was when his university suspended classes on November 11 after the Clear Water Bay campus was vandalised following the death of 22-year-old computer science undergraduate Chow Tsz-lok. Chow died after falling from the upper levels of a car park in Tseung Kwan O in circumstances that were investigated but never conclusively linked to protests. campus was vandalised Chow died after falling from the upper levels of a car park The violence at HKUST coupled with already rising anti-Chinese sentiment on the campus led to scores of mainland Chinese students fleeing the city along with Feng.

City University professor James Sung Lap-kung agreed, saying it was a shock for mainlanders to realise the scale of the sweeping negative views towards China among the city’s younger generations. However, people could get over shock and Hong Kong remained competitive in finance, trade and business – and that attracted talent from all over the world, including the mainland, Sung said. On that point he’s backed up by the “Global Competitiveness Report 2019” from the World Economic Forum. It ranked Hong Kong third after Singapore and the United States from among 141 economies surveyed.

Broader horizons Interviews with others in the gangpiao grouping about a future in Hong Kong point to a mixed outlook. gangpiao Eric He, 31, a mainlander and a salesman in a Chinese-owned securities company, has lived in Hong Kong for more than nine years and hopes to stay. “A lot of friends say drifters like me have to leave and return to the mainland as soon as possible due to the crisis here, but I still think Hong Kong is a place I love, a place that has good public order, future prospects and valuable wilderness to explore. I don’t want to waste the nine years I’ve spent here,” He said. Jing Fang, a master’s student at Baptist University, said she hoped to find a job in Hong Kong next year to gain work experience outside the mainland. “My relatives back in the mainland are really concerned for my safety here, but I don’t think the situation in Hong Kong has become that unbearable,” Fang said. “And I respect Hongkongers’ insistence to make their voices heard.” Hong Kong-based newspaper columnist Johnny Lau Yui-Siu said blaming the unrest for why some mainlanders were leaving missed the bigger picture. Johnny Lau Yui-Siu said blaming the unrest for why some mainlanders were leaving missed the bigger picture. “There are always people coming to Hong Kong and leaving Hong Kong, and these choices are made considering a series of factors including career opportunities, educational background and family needs,” Lau said. If mainlanders develop skills in Hong Kong that open up opportunities elsewhere then they may leave, he added. Stay or go: Hongkongers consider emigration options amid protests Stay or go: Hongkongers consider emigration options amid protests Geng Chunya, president of the Hong Kong Association of Mainland Graduates and a permanent resident since 2001, said he had noted a shift in attitude among the city’s mainland residents in recent years and it fitted right into the gangpiao mould – footloose and with broader horizons. gangpiao More students now graduated from universities in Hong Kong and went straight back to the mainland because they had a much more mobile mindset when looking at opportunities, Geng said. The 2019 protests were more of a catalyst, he said. In that respect, “Hong Kong’s relative decline in quality of life, cost of living and employment choices are the main factors for them leaving”, Geng said. “The unrest in the past year, in my eyes, is not the fundamental reason.” Read the first part in the series, on the implications of the pro-democrats’ landslide win in the district council polls, here, the second part, on the city’s role as a gateway to mainland China, here, the third part, on the risks and rewards for foreign professionals in Hong Kong, here, and the fourth part, on the youths whose lives have taken a dramatic turn, here.

Post A source with knowledge of the package said the 43-year-old resort in Southern district needed an immediate cash injection to stay afloat after falling visitor numbers in the four consecutive years to 2019 brought its finances to the brink. A war chest was also required to fund a major upgrade over the medium term so its attractions could compete with rivals in China and across the Asia-Pacific, the source added. Ocean Park in pay freeze as visitor numbers slump amid Hong Kong protests 3 Jan 2020 Ocean Park in pay freeze as visitor numbers slump amid Hong Kong protests 3 Jan 2020 “It needs fresh blood after suffering huge losses last year and this year,” the source said. “Every single month, it has lost a fortune.” Ocean Park faces competition from the city’s other theme park, Hong Kong Disneyland resort on Lantau Island. Both are being squeezed by rival attractions over the border, such as Chimelong Ocean Kingdom in Hengqin, Zhuhai. Ocean Park The park in the south of Hong Kong Island, which at one stage received donations from the Hong Kong Jockey Club, operates as a non-profit organisation and on a site provided for free by the government, which appoints its board members.  The government has a 53 per cent stake in the city’s Disneyland attraction, with Walt Disney in the United States owning the rest. Ocean Park’s latest troubles were exposed last week when it revealed cost-control measures following a 60 per cent plunge in visitor numbers between July and December last year on the same period in 2018. The park scrapped an annual salary review for some 2,000 full-time staff for 2020 and imposed measures such as reining in operating and discretionary expenses, stricter energy conservation and suspending all but essential recruitment in a bid to avoid redundancies.  Since June last year, Hong Kong has been ravaged by unrest sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, with radical protesters and riot police trading petrol bombs and tear gas in often-violent demonstrations.  The chaos has had a devastating impact, with preliminary statistics from Hong Kong Tourism Board showing visitor numbers in 2019 were down 14 per cent to about 55 million. More than 40 jurisdictions have issued warnings on Hong Kong travel.   The park said it expected market conditions to remain unpredictable, with no quick rebound in sight. Tourism sector lawmaker Yiu Si-wing said changes at the park were long overdue. “We have seen it lose money for some years, visitor arrivals continue to drop, and more competition arising from across the region,” said Yiu, who did not reveal any details of the HK$10 billion rescue plan. Visitor numbers at the park has fallen from 7.6 million in 2014 to 5.7 million last year. The deficit snowballed from HK$241.1 million in 2016 to HK$557.3 million last year. Typhoon and unrest combine in perfect storm as Ocean Park deficit hits US$72 million 11 Dec 2019 Typhoon and unrest combine in perfect storm as Ocean Park deficit hits US$72 million 11 Dec 2019 Yiu said it was not unusual for the government to support theme parks financially. A case in point was Disneyland’s HK$10.9 billion expansion that saw the Legislative Council approve taxpayers’ funding of HK$5.45 billion in 2017, Yiu said. In 2018, the government bailed out Ocean Park with HK$310 million, which was used to fund conservation education initiatives in science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics.   The park’s HK$10 billion funding bid will be discussed at a Legislative Council meeting on January 20. Pan-democrat lawmaker Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu of the Civic Party, who did not reveal any details of the rescue plan, said the park and the government needed to convince the public the proposals were acceptable. Ocean Park needs to ride wave of change 21 Dec 2019 Ocean Park needs to ride wave of change 21 Dec 2019 “It involves a big amount and is a very ambitious plan,” he said. A spokeswoman with the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau said the park submitted a strategic repositioning plan to the government to enhance its competitiveness, with details to be set out in a government paper to the Legco meeting. Ocean Park declined to comment. 	SCMP

At a Washington press conference, the top US diplomat attacked Beijing’s policies against the Uygurs, who largely live in the Xinjiang autonomous region in China’s northwest, as “part of the [Communist] Party’s broader war on faith”. “We are asking all countries, particularly those belonging to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Arab League, to denounce the Chinese Communist Party’s brutal treatment of Uygurs,” Pompeo said. More than a million of the group have reportedly been sent to mass detention centres in Xinjiang. Pompeo applauded a January 2 statement by Bahrain’s Council of Representatives expressing “deep concerns over the inhumane and painful conditions to which Uygur Muslims in China are subjected”. Bahrain appealed to the international community to “play its role and responsibilities, and save the lives of innocent Uygur Muslims”.  “The Chinese Communist Party is committing mass human rights violations and abuses against Uygurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and other Muslims held in detention in Xinjiang,” Pompeo said at the conference. Commenting on China’s recent appointment of Luo Huining as the head of the Chinese Hong Kong liaison office, Pompeo noted that Luo has “expressed hopes that Hong Kong will return to the right path”.  But “the right path, as I said before, is for the Chinese Communist Party to honour its commitment made to Hong Kong in the Sino-British Joint Declaration filed at the United Nations”, the secretary said.  He urged China to honour “the commitment that guarantees the territory’s independent rule of law and freedoms that the Chinese living on the mainland unfortunately do not enjoy”. “We will continue to work with Hong Kong and Chinese Communist Party officials to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong and Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy,” Pompeo said. US House passes Uygur law demanding sanctions on China over human rights abuses in Xinjiang US House passes Uygur law demanding sanctions on China over human rights abuses in Xinjiang In November, US President Donald Trump signed into law the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, brushing off multiple warnings by China against the potential repercussions of such a move. Among other mandates, the law will allow Washington to suspend Hong Kong’s special trading status if the city fails to retain a sufficient degree of autonomy under the “one country, two systems” framework in the eyes of the US State Department. The bill also empowers the State Department to sanction people deemed responsible for acts that undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy from mainland China, and directs US officers not to deny visas to individuals who have been subjected to “politically motivated” arrests or detention in the city. In December, The Global Times, a state-run mainland newspaper, dismissed the US moves as a response to “China's rise as a threat and challenge”. The Global Times, The US government’s concerns led to it “launching a trade war against China and piling pressure on the country under the pretext of so-called human rights issues in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, so as to contain China's development”, the newspaper said.

But the move has raised concerns over an invasion of privacy and a possible breach of land lease conditions on the provision of the public’s access to an open area on the Kowloon Tong campus. When the university planned a campus extension in 2007 for a School of Communication and Academy of Visual Arts building, public open space of about 1,800 square metres (19,375 square feet) was promised. According to its land lease and a Legislative Council document, the university said it would provide a sculpture garden with student artwork that would be open from 6am to 11pm every day. The building was completed in 2010 after lawmakers approved HK$237 million (US$30.5 million) in funding. Last week, Polytechnic University in Hung Hom installed turnstiles at the campus’ three main entrances despite its land lease stating that a 7,850 square metre open space must be accessible to the public between 7am and midnight. The Lands Department said on Tuesday that because campus renovations were under way, it was necessary to limit entry.  It also said it would communicate with PolyU to look for a solution. Various universities imposed extra control measures as the second term started this month, after protesters entered some campuses, vandalised buildings, made petrol bombs and blocked nearby roads last November.  At Baptist University’s visual arts building, where the public open space is located, temporary security checkpoints were set up at entrances.  Although entry to the sculpture garden was generally allowed to visitors when the Post checked on Tuesday, cordons were set up at another part of the open space. Post Lawmaker Andrew Wan Siu-kin said the university should meet the public’s expectations on its promise of access to the open space. “It is important to find out whether the university is in breach of any of these conditions,” he said. “Cordoning part of the area is not really necessary if the public should be allowed in.” Student accused of rioting at PolyU protest arrested again for breach of bail 7 Jan 2020 Student accused of rioting at PolyU protest arrested again for breach of bail 7 Jan 2020 A university spokesman said on Tuesday night that it had communicated with security staff to make sure the public could access the open space during opening hours. The Lands Department said it inspected the open space at Baptist University on Tuesday and found it was generally available for the public’s use, but a small portion of the area had been fenced off because of repair works nearby. It added that it would continue to communicate with the university to make sure land lease conditions were being strictly followed. Meanwhile, student union president Keith Fong Chung-yin said various groups had met with the university’s management last week to raise concerns over the card-reading machines. “Installing card-reading machines is unnecessary as there are security guards checking our IDs, which is also a quick process … The card-reading machines could also be an invasion of students’ privacy, making them feel they are being watched whenever they enter or leave the campus,” he said. Fong said the university told the student union that access records would be kept for about three weeks. Senior lecturer Bruce Lui Ping-kuen agreed there were potential privacy issues and urged the university to detail how it would handle access records transparently to ease concerns. But Joyce Wong, a third-year social sciences student, said she was not too concerned about privacy issues, as she believed the university would not provide the data to a third party or use it for other purposes. A university spokeswoman said the management had been communicating closely with students on the new security measures, and their suggestions and concerns would be taken into consideration. 	SCMP

Organised by the Hong Kong Tourism Board, the 2020 Cathay Pacific International Chinese New Year Carnival will take place at the West Kowloon Cultural District Art Park from January 25-28, featuring performances, festive installations and food booths to mark the Year of the Rat. Revealing more details on Tuesday, the board said there might be security checks, but police would not enter the venue unless called upon. Visitors are free to express their political views by chanting slogans and singing songs as long as they do not affect others, it added. Mason Hung Chung-hing, the board’s general manager, stressed the most important thing would be safety and the board hoped to proceed with the carnival as planned.  “We are, of course, worried about [an abrupt cancellation],” Hung said, adding that if any unforeseen situations arose, decisions would be made at the time on how to handle them. It is the first time the Lunar New Year night parade – one of the most important events in Hong Kong’s cultural calendar that draws thousands of locals and tourists, as well an array of international performers, to Tsim Sha Tsui – will not be held since its launch in 1996. The board’s decision follows a flurry of major events being cancelled in the city, including music festival Clockenflap and the Cyclothon, as often violent protests have roiled the city for almost eight months.  In November, the board’s executive director Dane Cheng Ting-yat announced a format change, saying the usual parade route was “too risky to accommodate crowds and maintain public order”.  Hung said on Tuesday the change was not a response to the social movement, but more about coming up with new elements to celebrate the event’s 25th year. Flash-mob protests have sprouted in various parts of the city as unrest triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, has snowballed into a much wider anti-government movement. Demonstrators often gather in groups to chant slogans and sing protest anthem .   On chanting slogans or singing songs, Hung said “[as long as] we feel it is not affecting the whole event, we will not stop it from happening.” The board hoped to attract 150,000 visitors to the carnival – a figure similar to the turnout for last year’s parade. Revellers can enjoy the free event and enjoy a parade along the promenade in West Kowloon as well as performances by 26 international teams – the largest number of foreign performing groups in the event’s history. One highlight will be a pop dance show by V. Unbeatable from India, who shot to fame in 2019’s America’s Got Talent. America’s Got Talent Food lovers can sample streets eats at 12 booths at the site. From January 25 to 28, the carnival will start at 2pm and close at 8pm every day, except for the second day, when it will close three hours earlier at 5pm. 	SCMP

Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor also believed that she could work well with Luo Huining, who took over from Wang Zhimin as director of the central government’s liaison office in the city on Saturday in the first major leadership change since anti-government protests broke out in June, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor anti-government protests extradition bill Luo’s appointment was announced by Xinhua news agency, which did not give a reason for the change, but a source familiar with the operation of the liaison office previously said Wang’s departure was a gesture towards holding him accountable for the pro-establishment camp’s defeat in November’s district council elections. The bloc lost heavily, winning just 60 out of 452 seats across the city. district council elections Before the weekly meeting of the Executive Council, the chief executive’s top advisory body, on Tuesday, Lam was asked if she was worried that the central government would also seek to replace her or her top officials. The chief executive did not give a direct answer, but emphasised that her cabinet had been committed in past months to helping Hong Kong overcome difficulties. Beijing’s new Hong Kong envoy was a surprise choice. Here’s why 17 Feb 2020 Beijing’s new Hong Kong envoy was a surprise choice. Here’s why 17 Feb 2020 “We are also facing a lot of challenges. Apart from ending violence and restoring social order, we have to handle the economic recession this year, which seems to be more serious [than last year]. In addition, I am facing this public health risk today,” she warned, referring to a mystery outbreak of pneumonia in central China for which Hong Kong has stepped up checks. stepped up checks  “So with challenges in areas such as the economy, health and politics, we need the team of accountable officials, including myself, to be dedicated to our positions.” Mystery pneumonia infects at least 59 people in Wuhan, China Mystery pneumonia infects at least 59 people in Wuhan, China Hong Kong officially slipped into a recession in the third quarter last year. On Luo’s appointment, she said: “We have expected to meet later this week. I will meet him and I am sure we can work together in strict accordance with the implementation of ‘one country, two systems’ and the Basic Law to ensure the continued stability of Hong Kong, especially after the seven months of social unrest that has caused society very major concern.”  Under Beijing’s “one country, two systems” principle and the city’s mini-constitution, Hong Kong was guaranteed a high degree of autonomy after it was returned from British rule in 1997.  Asked to comment on Beijing’s decision to bring a political veteran with no relevant experience out of semi-retirement and make him the top envoy to Hong Kong, Lam said she could offer no particular comment on the personnel changes in the central government’s agency in the city. A Hong Kong government source said Lam was expected to meet Luo at Government House, the chief executive’s official residence, on Thursday or Friday. “There won’t be any press arrangements for the meeting. The government will issue a press release afterwards,” the source said. Lam met Wang at Government House on September 28, 2017, six days after he took up the post of liaison office director. Small crowds gather across Hong Kong for regular lunchtime protests 6 Jan 2020 Small crowds gather across Hong Kong for regular lunchtime protests 6 Jan 2020 During the meeting, she expressed the hope that the liaison office would continue to help promote co-operation between Hong Kong and mainland China. A source familiar with the situation said it was unlikely that Beijing would make a dramatic change to its policies towards Hong Kong following Luo’s appointment. “Luo didn’t mention the phrase ‘stop violence’ when he spoke to the media on Monday, probably because the situation has become calmer recently,” the source said. “It shouldn’t be read as a sign of Beijing softening its stance.” Lam also declined to comment on Luo’s use of words.

Yuen Long District Council, which is now dominated by pro-democracy parties, set up the group on Tuesday to look into the incident, during which a mob of armed men wearing white T-shirts attacked people inside the town’s MTR station. However, police opted not to attend the meeting, despite being invited, drawing an angry response from pan-democrat councillors, who accused the force of showing “zero respect” to the council. Anti-government protesters, who were among those attacked, have accused police of being slow to respond to the incident. “It is ridiculous,” the Democratic Party’s Roy Kwong Chun-yu said. “The police’s absence demonstrates their zero respect – if not disregard – for the district council, which formally requested their attendance.” In a written statement, police said 37 people had been arrested for their roles in the events of July 21, and seven of those had been charged with rioting. “It is not appropriate for us to comment further as the incident has entered judicial proceedings,” the force said.  The motion to create the task force was backed by 33 pro-democracy councillors, whose term began at the start of the year. Rural councillors and members of the pro-establishment camp did not vote. Democratic Alliance councillor Shek King-ching said he was at the station when the attack happened, and saw two passengers with head wounds caused by the mob.  “A task force was what voters had asked for,” he said. “I hope more citizens will come out and share their experiences so we can reconstruct the truth.”     “Some citizens have been attacked on the streets, while protesters have also vandalised shops,” councillor Shum Ho-kit said. “I hope the task force will also look into the violent incidents in Yuen Long.” That suggestion was dismissed by the council, which elected former student leader Tommy Cheung Sau-yin as the task force’s chairman. Further motions were also passed at the meeting – including the council calling on the government to hold an independent inquiry into the police’s handling of the civil unrest sweeping the city since last June, and to drop the controversial building of a HK$1.7 billion (US$218 million) footbridge in the district. In response, the Highways Department said it had no timetable for applying for funding from the Legislative Council’s Finance Committee for the project. Pan-democrat councillors plan boycott of meeting with Hong Kong No 2 official 4 Jan 2020 Pan-democrat councillors plan boycott of meeting with Hong Kong No 2 official 4 Jan 2020 Several district councils, including Kwai Tsing, Sham Shui Po, Tuen Mun, Tai Po, Wan Chai, North, Southern and Yau Tsim Mong, also convened their first meeting on Tuesday, and all pressed the government to respond to the five core demands of protesters, which include an independent probe into the police force’s handling of protests and implementation of universal suffrage. The pro-democracy bloc, which scored an unprecedented landslide victory in November’s district elections, swept both the chairmanship and vice-chairmanship at these councils with a majority. Councillors in Tai Po passed a motion to set up a constitutional affairs and security committee to monitor the work of police and the Security Bureau. In Kwai Tsing, pro-democracy councillors sung the protest anthem Glory to Hong Kong during the meeting, sparking a walkout from their pro-establishment rivals. Glory to Hong Kong Pro-establishment lawmaker Priscilla Leung Mei-fun, a member of the Basic Law Committee, which advises Beijing, warned that those councillors who sang the anthem might risk violating their statement to uphold the city’s mini-constitution and pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. She said the lyrics challenged the “one country, two systems” principle under which Beijing governs the city. Meanwhile, speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor expressed regret that some newly elected councillors had decided to boycott a meeting with Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, Hong Kong’s No 2 official. “I hope they will change their minds because it’s a briefing for us to give them information and listen to what they have to tell us,” she said. Some pan-democrats had objected to Lam personally meeting defeated pro-establishment candidates, but sending Cheung to meet them. Lam said the two meetings were different, and she had met the outgoing councillors to express her appreciation for their support over the past four years. “I’m happy to find a suitable way to listen to the views of the district councils when I compile the annual policy address,” she added. Separately, a survey by Chinese University’s Hong Kong Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies found that 78.9 per cent of 708 respondents polled between December 16 and 20 agreed the district council elections in November were “fair and just”. But in-depth analysis found that only 40.4 per cent of those identified themselves as pro-establishment shared the sentiment, while 50.9 per cent disagreed. The pro-democracy bloc bagged almost 90 per cent of the seats and took control of all but one of Hong Kong’s 18 district councils in the November elections.

Looking at how comrades in Hong Kong have been injured, arrested and sacrificed, I feel that I do not deserve to be staying in such a peaceful and safe place in Taiwan,” wrote one of them. Another wrote: “My life has settled down here. I don’t feel happy but I am at ease, finally. ‘Safety matters more than anything’ – that’s what I think … I am grateful for the warmth and friendliness of the people of Taiwan.  “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times! Wish we could all be unmasked and gather one day, take care!” From landslide win to uphill task for Taiwan presidential hopeful 17 Feb 2020 From landslide win to uphill task for Taiwan presidential hopeful 17 Feb 2020 To Wong, these letters showed the sacrifices being made for the larger cause of democracy. The lawyer is in talks – which he did not want to elaborate on – on the visa status of these protesters. They had not jumped bail, he insisted, but were on extended tourist visas, some for as long as five months, as they feared arrest back in Hong Kong.  “They are young people with a supposedly bright future but now they’ve had to leave home and be away from their families,” he said. They were walking proof of how Beijing had instilled fear and “could sweep away all our autonomy”, Wong claimed. Taiwan has hosted waves of such protesters who fled Hong Kong since the ongoing unrest began in June, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. Coincidentally, the aborted legislation was initiated as a wish to bring to justice Hongkonger Chan Tong-kai, who is wanted on suspicion of killing his girlfriend while they were holidaying in Taiwan in 2018. Chan Tong-kai Apart from volunteers such as Wong, churches and social welfare groups in Taiwan are also helping the protesters. For example, the Chi-Nan Presbyterian Church in Taipei has offered humanitarian assistance to some 200 of them. Many remain traumatised, Reverend Huang Chunsheng said. Some could still “smell tear gas, and some jumped out of their beds during the middle of the night in fear police were coming” for them, according to Huang. It is stories such as these being shared on the ground that add to the climate of “never let it be us” among Taiwanese voters, analysts said, and this is how the Hong Kong factor has shaped the elections, providing a stark contrast of how the “one country, two systems” model could never work for Taiwan. Tsai has been using the stories of Hong Kong protesters in her campaign speeches to drive home this message. During the last televised debate of the three presidential candidates, she read out excerpts from a letter she said she had received from a youngster in Hong Kong. Taiwan’s Tsai Ing-wen poised to complete political comeback 17 Feb 2020 Taiwan’s Tsai Ing-wen poised to complete political comeback 17 Feb 2020 Quoting the letter writer, she said: “‘I ask that Taiwan’s people do not believe the Chinese Communists, don’t believe any pro-Communist official, and don’t fall into China’s money trap’. “If the young generation in Taiwan has to take to the streets 20 years later, Hong Kong by then can no longer demonstrate how to fight any more.” Describing the words as mixed with blood and tears, Tsai urged Taiwanese people to decide whether “a democratic and free lifestyle can continue” with their votes. Protests send Hongkongers to Taiwan in search of new lives Protests send Hongkongers to Taiwan in search of new lives Few doubt that the Hong Kong protests have boosted the political fortunes of Tsai as opinion polls show her populist rival Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu, from the mainland-friendly Kuomintang (KMT) trailing her by more than 20 points. Her reversal in fortunes came within months of the protests beginning. In January last year, she resigned as chairwoman of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), after a humiliating electoral defeat the previous November. Her party retained only six of the 13 cities and counties it used to control, compared with the 15 won by the KMT. Hsiao Tu-huan, a researcher at the Centre for Cross-Strait Relations in Tamkang University in Taiwan, said Tsai had benefited tremendously from the Hong Kong unrest. Beijing claims Taiwan parties have explored ‘one country, two systems’ 17 Feb 2020 Beijing claims Taiwan parties have explored ‘one country, two systems’ 17 Feb 2020 “The DPP suffered a crushing defeat in local elections in November last year. But the controversy over the now-withdrawn extradition bill raised the concerns of Taiwanese about the developments in Hong Kong and the cross-strait relationship,” said Hsiao, also a board member of Taiwan Network for Free Elections. Tsai used the Hong Kong unrest to play up a “sense of crisis” if she were not re-elected that the democratic island of 23 million people risked being swallowed up by Beijing, which considers it part of its own territory that must one day be brought under its fold, by force if necessary. Many said the Hong Kong government led by Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and its pro-Beijing allies should share the blame for helping Tsai pull the self-ruled island further away from the mainland. Hong Kong gave Tsai ‘ammunition’ Hong Kong gave Tsai ‘ammunition’ Tam Yiu-chung, the city’s sole deputy to Beijing’s top legislative body, the standing committee of the National People’s Congress, agreed the extradition bill had been like “giving ammunition” to Tsai and her DPP. “In hindsight, yes, you may argue that the Hong Kong government lacked political sensitivity over the issue … raising this before the elections,” he said. The government had mistakenly believed the anger would dissipate once the bill was passed, he said, pointing to the way controversy over the so-called co-location arrangement, which allowed mainland officers control over a part of the West Kowloon terminal of the high-speed rail link, petered out. co-location arrangement   Tam’s party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress for Hong Kong (DAB), was the first party to urge the government to plug the legal loophole with the extradition bill, as its chairwoman Starry Lee Wai-king and lawmaker Holden Chow Ho-ding first met the press with the mother of the murder victim Poon Hiu-Wing, 20, in February 2019. Poon is believed to have been killed by Chan in February 2018. Chan returned to Hong Kong to escape arrest. Lacking enough evidence to try him for a killing in another jurisdiction, and unable to send him back in the absence of an extradition agreement, Hong Kong prosecutors charged him only for money laundering for using Poon’s bank card on his return. believed to have been killed by Chan Taiwanese president Tsai denies ‘using’ Hong Kong protests for election 10 Dec 2019 Taiwanese president Tsai denies ‘using’ Hong Kong protests for election 10 Dec 2019 “We were doing our job as elected lawmakers to reflect the opinion of citizens who supported the extradition bill,” Starry Lee told the Post last week. “I believe I am also among those who expressed in public, at a rather early stage, that we understood the situation if the chief executive had to withdraw the bill.” Post Even after the bill was withdrawn the protests continued, and the Hong Kong government was seen as hapless in dealing with the Chan case. Chan reportedly wanted to return to Taiwan upon his release from prison last October to face justice, but the Hong Kong authorities found itself in a war of words, with Taiwan authorities refusing to take him back and eager to capitalise on the issue. reportedly wanted to return to Taiwan Zhu Songling, a professor at the Institute of Taiwan Studies at Beijing Union University, said given such politicking it was unfair to lay all the blame on the Hong Kong government. The Chan case would have been exploited during elections even without the bill. “Pro-independence forces would use the controversy to serve their political agenda no matter how the Hong Kong government handled it,” Zhu said. However, the timing of the case and the ensuing fracas over the bill was unfortunate. It came just months after President Xi Jinping last January called for cross-strait unification talks under the one country, two systems framework, similar to how Hong Kong and Macau are governed. called for cross-strait unification talks Tsai had used the confluence of these events to establish herself as a defender of Taiwan sovereignty after rejecting Xi’s call. Whether it was Hong Kong or some other trigger, Zhu said: “Taiwan authorities have never made a positive response since Beijing put forward the one country, two systems in the early 1980s.” What does ‘one country, two systems’ mean? What does ‘one country, two systems’ mean? One country, two systems – never in Taiwan? One country, two systems – never in Taiwan? At the core of the Hong Kong factor in the Taiwanese elections is the fate of one country, two systems principle first articulated by late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. “The one country, two systems formula has lost further appeal among Taiwanese in the wake of the protests against the extradition bill in Hong Kong,” Hsiao said. “Many young people in Taiwan feel there is a stronger need to resist the mainland’s interference in Taiwan’s politics.” Ho Ming-sho, professor with the National Taiwan University’s sociology department, agreed the Hong Kong protests had reinforced the negative image of the one country, two systems principle among many Taiwanese, and had dealt a blow to Han Kuo-yu’s campaign. “According to several opinion polls, Han’s popularity peaked in July but slid since then,” Ho said, adding that the reversal of Han’s fortunes also stemmed from other factors, such as his own performance after his election as Kaohsiung mayor last year. Han, seen as Beijing’s favoured candidate in the presidential race because of his friendly stance towards the mainland, has never recovered from the accusation he had not shown concern for the plight of Hong Kong protesters. He also did not help his campaign when he visited Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong last March and was accused of “selling out” Taiwan. He in turn has accused Tsai of exploiting the “blood of protesters” for her own political ends. He came around to expressing support for the protesters later and stressed he did not accept one country, two systems in his campaign, but these conciliatory messages came too little, too late, according to analysts. Taiwan president’s New Year address defends law aimed at Beijing influence 17 Feb 2020 Taiwan president’s New Year address defends law aimed at Beijing influence 17 Feb 2020 When the one country, two systems model of a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong was formulated by Deng back in 1984, he made clear the policy was, “to solve the Hong Kong and Taiwan problems by allowing two systems to coexist in one country”. Several recently declassified British government files provided further evidence of Beijing’s intentions. According to the minutes of a British cabinet meeting on January 18, 1996, foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind, who had met Chinese officials, said Beijing wished for Hong Kong to have one country, two systems, “not simply because it was desirable in its own right, but because of the potential prize of Taiwan”. He added: “If China was able to show that one country, two systems arrangements could be made to work, then the prospects for Taiwan’s return to the motherland would improve. If, on the other hand, Hong Kong were to collapse, then Taiwan’s interest in any form of reunification would evaporate.” Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen says talks with Beijing could resume 30 Dec 2019 Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen says talks with Beijing could resume 30 Dec 2019 With the protests becoming the most serious fissure in the implementation of one country, two systems in the past 23 years since the handover, it would appear questions of its applicability, future review or revision will remain long after the Taiwanese election results come in on January 11. Those questions apply for Hong Kong as they do for Taiwan, observers said. According to a poll by the University of Hong Kong’s public opinion programme, the net confidence in one country, two systems was recorded as negative 28 percentage points – an all-time low since records began in 1993. Some 62 per cent of respondents said they had no-confidence in the principle, while only 34 per cent expressed confidence. Another online survey commissioned by the Post found about 56 per cent of voters said they only wanted greater autonomy for Hong Kong. But some 16 per cent supported the notion of breaking away from China. Post In Taiwan, the latest survey by Commonwealth magazine, found among 1,076 people that nine in 10 felt the one country, two systems model was not applicable to the island. Commonwealth Taiwan chief of staff remembered as ‘outstanding’ commander 17 Feb 2020 Taiwan chief of staff remembered as ‘outstanding’ commander 17 Feb 2020 Li Xiaobing, an expert on Beijing’s policies on Hong Kong at Nankai University in Tianjin, conceded that the perception of one country, two systems among some Taiwanese had been adversely affected by the protests in Hong Kong. “But it’s unfair to describe it as Beijing’s setback. The fact is Taiwan authorities have been sparing no effort in resisting one country, two systems,” Li said. Starry Lee said despite the blame critics might want to attribute to Hong Kong, or pro-Beijing allies such as the DAB, the reality was that one country, two systems was still a national policy “unstoppable by anyone”. “Whether it is feasible in Taiwan would depend on the will of all Chinese people, including Taiwanese comrades,” she said.   Looking ahead, Tam Yiu-chung believed one country, two systems was still the best policy for both Hong Kong and Taiwan. “There is no option for Taiwan to be independent, let alone Hong Kong,” Tam said. “That is the bottom line.” While Hong Kong’s situation was pictured as a bogeyman in Taiwan, Tam saw some new parameters also being set because of the crisis. “Even under such a chaotic situation in Hong Kong, the central government has been very tolerant. No hardline measures have been announced, and Beijing has refrained from sending in the People’s Liberation Army,” he said. Beijing more confident than ever of Taiwan reunification, says official 20 Dec 2019 Beijing more confident than ever of Taiwan reunification, says official 20 Dec 2019 On the Taiwan situation, Tam said no matter the outcome, people-to-people exchanges between Taiwan and the mainland would continue, pointing to how Beijing had launched a series of measures attracting businessmen from Taiwan. Zhu also believed the central government would step up efforts to win the hearts and minds of Taiwan residents after the polls, citing as an example the issuance of mainland residence permits to Taiwanese in September 2018. But the facts on the ground will not change, according to observers such as Leung Man-to, a political professor at National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan, who is originally from Hong Kong. “One country, two systems will never be accepted in Taiwan. It is impossible,” he said. “But what I see is that Taiwan has been becoming Hong Kong already.” He said Beijing had stepped up the “united front work” in Taiwan, infiltrating different businesses and even pouring money in to help Han’s campaign bid. Murder suspect Chan is awaiting the outcome of the elections too. Reverend Canon Peter Koon Ho-ming, a top Anglican priest who played a key role in persuading him to surrender to Taiwan authorities, told the Post recently he still intended to surrender and would do so at an appropriate time. Post For Hong Kong lawyer Wong, Tsai’s victory would mean a better future for the Hong Kong protesters taking refuge there.

138	https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3044905/beijings-new-hong-kong-envoy-luo-huining-was-surprise-choice	2020-02-17	Beijing’s new Hong Kong envoy Luo Huining was a surprise choice. Here’s why	Bringing a political veteran with no relevant experience out of semi-retirement and making him the top envoy to Hong Kong shows Beijing’s determination to reset its policy on the city, according to insiders and observers. Luo Huining’s appointment as the new director of the central government’s liaison office in Hong Kong came as a surprise even to Communist Party insiders. But while he is seen as capable, he was an unlikely candidate for the job. new director of the central government’s liaison office Having turned 65 in October, Luo was supposed to be easing into semi-retirement. Under party rules, senior officials of Luo’s rank are relieved from key positions at the age of 65. They are then transferred to less demanding roles – usually in China’s two parliamentary houses – before they formally retire at 68. Luo appeared to be following the script until Saturday’s announcement. After stepping down as party secretary of Shanxi province in November, he was named deputy director of the financial and economic affairs committee of the National People’s Congress on December 28. Saturday’s announcement But seven days later, Beijing suddenly appointed him as its new representative in Hong Kong – at a time when the city is facing its worst political crisis in decades, with seven months of anti-government protests showing no sign of abating. The protests were sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill and have broadened to other demands, including universal suffrage. anti-government protests extradition bill Luo’s abrupt appointment suggests it was a decision made recently, and it was kept on a need-to-know basis until the last minute. A source familiar with the discussions told the South China Morning Post that President Xi Jinping only finalised the decision after his trip to Macau in the third week of December. South China Morning Post his trip to Macau  Without clear instructions from the top, the party’s Organisation Department assumed Luo would follow the well-established protocol – so his “semi-retirement” was arranged and his transfer to the NPC was announced. Even those who will have a direct working relationship with Luo in Hong Kong were briefed just ahead of the official announcement.  Another source said: “In the last reshuffle, the section heads [of the liaison office] met their outgoing boss and the new boss a day before the formal announcement.  “This time, the section heads were only briefed less than an hour before the Xinhua announcement. Many were surprised that Wang Zhimin [Luo’s predecessor] was not even present at the briefing.”  PLA’s Hong Kong garrison holds joint drill in city’s harbour in ‘message to radical protesters’ 15 Feb 2020 PLA’s Hong Kong garrison holds joint drill in city’s harbour in ‘message to radical protesters’ 15 Feb 2020 Deng Yuwen, a former deputy editor of Study Times, a newspaper published by the Central Party School, said the move showed that Xi wanted to make sure he got the best man for the job – even if it meant bending the rules. Study Times “Xi is flexible. He will not let an arbitrary retirement age rule get in the way of his overall plan,” Deng said. “He believes that age isn’t a major problem, as long as the person is healthy and fit for the job.” Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore, believed the crushing defeat of the pro-Beijing camp during Hong Kong’s district council elections was “the final straw” to prompt a change at the liaison office. Candidates from the opposition camp scored a major victory over their pro-establishment rivals on November 24, winning the majority in 17 out of the 18 district councils. “The liaison office in Hong Kong is clearly responsible for this major defeat as helping the pro-establishment camp to win elections is one of their main tasks,” Wu said. “There is not much time left and lots of work to do with the [Legislative Council] election only nine months away, so Beijing had to make a decision.” That urgency had compelled Beijing to break protocol and cast its net wide, he said. Luo is also the first liaison office director with no work experience related to Hong Kong. A brief business trip to the city in 2018 is the only known connection Luo has with the former British colony. All of his predecessors had dealt with Hong Kong affairs before they took the job. Most were technocrats who had spent much of their careers at one of the central government’s bureaucratic agencies in Beijing. In contrast, Luo’s career was made in places far from the capital. He spent more than a decade in the northwest province of Qinghai – one of the most impoverished parts of China, better known to the West as the birthplace of the Dalai Lama – where he rose from deputy governor to governor, and eventually party secretary. Qinghai posted fast economic growth under his watch. In 2016, he was given the tough assignment of party secretary of resource-rich central province Shanxi. At the time, the province was mired in corruption scandals and its once fast-growing economy was on the brink of collapse. It was known as the “political minefield of China” due to the complex web of connections between many local businesses and powerful cliques and ministries in Beijing. Luo acted fast to tackle corruption and got the economy back in shape – something that showed a skill for problem-solving and deft handling of intricate political relations, according to another source. That caught the attention of the top leadership. “Luo managed to fix the Shanxi crisis and found a way for the province to move forward,” said Li Xiaobing, a law professor and expert on Beijing’s policies on Hong Kong at Nankai University in Tianjin. “Hopefully he can use his problem-solving skills to help find ways to move Hong Kong forward.” Dozens detained by police after march against parallel traders in Hong Kong’s Sheung Shui Dozens detained by police after march against parallel traders in Hong Kong’s Sheung Shui Luo is the only liaison office director with local administration experience at the highest level. Deng said the appointment reflected Beijing’s awareness of the complexity of the Hong Kong situation, and its potential impact on other key issues like Taiwan and China-US relations. Beijing realised a different kind of liaison office director was needed, he said. “I think it is a factor. Xi wants somebody who can ‘connect the dots’ instead of someone with specialist skills and a fixed perspective,” Deng said. Li agreed, saying an “all weather” administrator could give Beijing a better assessment of the situation and come up with proposals that were not just for existing problems, but long-term solutions to ensure the “one country, two systems” framework continued to function in the city. A separate source familiar with the matter said the fact Luo had never held a position related to Hong Kong could be seen as an advantage, since he would bring a fresh perspective. It could also confound the opposition, since they would be dealing with a mainland official they had little knowledge of. “His deputies and the liaison office officials have the local know-how,” the source said. “It’s actually better that Luo does not have connections with existing liaison office people and Hong Kong’s business and other communities, so he can carry out his work and Beijing’s will without the complications of these relationships.” Stay or go? Hong Kong’s protest crisis raises career doubts for expats 28 Dec 2019 Stay or go? Hong Kong’s protest crisis raises career doubts for expats 28 Dec 2019 His doctoral degree in political economics from Renmin University of China may also help. Song Sio-chong, professor of the Centre for Basic Laws of Hong Kong and Macau at Shenzhen University, said although developing the economy would not be Luo’s priority, he could help Beijing with the Greater Bay Area project to integrate Hong Kong with Macau and nine cities in Guangdong. Luo would also give “valuable advice” to the Hong Kong government on economic issues, Song said. It is still too early to tell what kind of working relationship Luo will have with Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor. But according to another source, Luo’s experience as an administrator would not change the role of the liaison office and he would not be “running the show”. “His experience will help him to make a more comprehensive assessment of the situation, so the office can give [better] advice to the central government. That’s the job of the liaison office,” the source said. “The one country, two systems arrangement is valuable to China and there’s no reason why it would be set aside.” In New Year’s Eve speech, Xi Jinping ‘hopes for the best’ for Hong Kong in 2020 In New Year’s Eve speech, Xi Jinping ‘hopes for the best’ for Hong Kong in 2020 A Hong Kong affairs expert from Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou said providing Beijing with accurate and objective information would be a priority for Luo. “The liaison office is said to have submitted an optimistic report to Beijing before the district council elections, but it turned out completely the opposite,” the expert said. “Beijing needs Luo to overhaul the operation so they can come up with more accurate information so the top leadership can make the right decisions.” Luo’s age could also be an advantage – as he nears the end of his political career he could take a bolder approach to tackling tough issues. By the time he reaches the final retirement age of 68, Hong Kong will have just held its next chief executive election. Another source said that was another reason Luo was in the job – to give Beijing an unbiased representative when candidates began jockeying for power. Beijing may also be more likely to reach out to the opposition camp through Luo, according to Deng. “As a new director with no [Hong Kong] baggage, it will be easier for Luo to reach out to different segments in society – including the opposition – and hear them out,” Deng said.

In a strongly worded letter Monday, Chief Superintendent Kwok Ka-chuen of the police public relations branch expressed “utmost disappointment” with Mo and called on her to join with the force to stop violence and restore peace. Mo argued she had only cited what had been reported in the news. At the centre of the row was a television interview Mo gave to the British media outlet Sky News on the night of January 1 about the New Year’s Day protests in Hong Kong that ended in chaos. Several local newspapers cited the interview to report Mo’s claim that police had sent undercover officers to vandalise shops on that day. In the letter, Kwok said: “Without any factual basis, you outrageously and irresponsibly claimed that the Hong Kong Police Force had sent two undercover officers to vandalise shops in Wan Chai, with the intention to use the incident to halt the [New Year’s Day] public protests. “You also blamed the police’s use of force as excessive, alleging that police had rounded up people, terrorising Hong Kong.  “We strongly refute these wild accusations ... Such accusations were utterly false and founded on fake news.” “It is therefore of utmost disappointment that you chose to report this piece of fake news on a live broadcast.”   She added: “Now, police say my claims are baseless. They are certainly not [baseless].” At least 400 arrested as New Year’s Day march gets cut short amid violence 3 Jan 2020 At least 400 arrested as New Year’s Day march gets cut short amid violence 3 Jan 2020 Hours after news reports emerged on January 1 quoting “witnesses” that undercover officers had vandalised shops, police issued statements to deny the allegations.  The organiser of the New Year’s Day march, the Civil Human Rights Front, claimed more than 1.03 million people turned up. But police estimated around 47,000 people had left the starting point of the march at Victoria Park, while another 13,000 were still inside the park awaiting as the force halted the march early amid vandalism and violence. Also on Monday, the customs department rejected online rumours that police arrested one of its employees and seized his firearms. The department expressed regret over the “intentional spread of the confusing and unfounded rumours”. 	SCMP

Australian National University student Leung Ka-kei, 24, was charged with rioting at Kowloon City Magistracy on November 20 last year, when a record number of more than 200 defendants appeared in six courts to face charges in connection with anti-government protests outside Polytechnic University earlier that month. The undergraduate was allowed to leave Hong Kong to continue his studies abroad for designated periods, after he posted a HK$50,000 (US$6,427) cash bail along with a surety of HK$100,000. On Sunday night, he arrived at Hong Kong International Airport to board a flight to Japan at 1.25am the next day, to join an exchange programme at Osaka University. But after he passed through a security check at 11.30pm, he was stopped at the immigration checkpoint as officers found out the court had only allowed him to travel starting midnight on Monday.

Acting principal magistrate Ada Yim Shun-yee said officers had no discretion to let the defendant walk free even though the breach of bail conditions was not premeditated.  But she decided to make no orders on the incident, after prosecutors agreed that the breach was a technical one, and did not oppose the continuation of the defendant’s bail in its original terms. The student will take a flight to Japan later this week.  Leung was among 213 defendants charged over violent clashes between anti-government protesters and police on November 18, a day after officers besieged the campus of Polytechnic University in Hung Hom and its surrounding areas. Over 13 days, some 1,377 people were arrested, while 318 underage teens had their information recorded by police. More than 200 defendants charged over stand-off outside PolyU brought to courts 21 Nov 2019 More than 200 defendants charged over stand-off outside PolyU brought to courts 21 Nov 2019 The mass arrests on November 18 saw magistrates sitting from 9.30am on November 20 until 12.40am the following morning, with lawyers, reporters, and the family members, friends, and supporters of the defendants moving between courts to see them. Leung was charged with taking part in a riot with other persons at the junction of Nathan Road and Waterloo Road. He is exempted from appearing in the next court hearing on March 11, but must obey a curfew, stay away from Polytechnic University and its vicinity, and report to police once a week after he returns to Hong Kong.

The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong on Monday floated dozens of suggestions at a meeting with Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po on the budget to be announced in February. The recommendations include increasing resources to set up 24-hour special courts, strengthen police equipment, and clean up “Lennon Walls” bearing pro-democracy messages that have sprung up across the city over the past seven months of anti-government protests. The protests, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, have rocked Hong Kong since June last year. More than 6,000 protesters have been arrested so far. “By setting up special courts, the judiciary can deal faster with the mounting number of protest-related cases,” DAB vice-chairman Holden Chow Ho-ding said. “We believe that could also deter those joining the protests.” Hong Kong slips into recession as economy shrinks 3.2 per cent in the third quarter 31 Oct 2019 Hong Kong slips into recession as economy shrinks 3.2 per cent in the third quarter 31 Oct 2019 The party also urged the government to budget more resources for police and establish a fund to help enterprises – especially those that had been vandalised during the protests – to recover from losses. “As the Lennon walls are popping up again across the city, we urge the government to allocate more resources for various departments to carry out regular cleaning,” Chow said.  Party chairwoman Starry Lee Wai-king called on the government to seize the chance and demonstrate its determination to tackle the deep-seated problems in society, which she said, included skyrocketing house prices, the poverty gap, and the lack of opportunities for upward mobility. The suggestions of DAB include increasing resources to clean up Lennon Walls that have sprung up across Hong Kong.

Lee said her party did not oppose the idea, but added the priority of the government should be to solve the “deep-seated conflicts”.  Last month, the government downgraded its forecast for 2019’s budget from a surplus of HK$16.8 billion to a deficit, with public spending rising above income for the first time in 15 years.  The judiciary told the Post the actual time required for a criminal trial to take place from its first appearance at the courts varies from case to case. “It depends on a wide range of factors – such as the complexity of the case, the number of defendants involved, the anticipated length of the trial, as well as the availability of the counsel and the court. At present, most of the cases relating to the recent social situation are not ready for trial yet,” it wrote, adding that the judiciary would strive to deal with cases expeditiously and efficiently. Post The recommendation to increase resources for police is set to be controversial, with opposition politicians already asking for the force to be removed from a ­government funding request for civil servants’ pay rise. Opposition legislators argued that police did not deserve any increase in wage or overtime pay amid allegations of brutality in handling protesters. 	SCMP

Two petrol bombs were thrown into Spicegirl in Lai Chi Kok Road, Sham Shui Po, soon after 2am on Monday when the eatery was still open, before two assailants fled on foot, leaving staff to tackle the flames. One of the firebombs exploded and was quickly extinguished by restaurant staff. The other did not go off and was later seized by police. No one was injured in the incident. Police said the two male attackers were wearing black clothes, masks and hats at the time of the attack. Officers scouted the area, but no arrests were made. Detectives have checked CCTV footage to gather evidence.  “The motive behind the attack is unknown,” police said. The business had been accused of offering shelter to men who had reportedly attacked anti-government protesters in Mong Kok last month.  After last month’s attack, the person in charge of the restaurant issued a statement and posted it outside the entrance.  He said he had reported an incident last month to police when diners were involved in a dispute with others in the restaurant. “I have never taken part in or planned any illegal and violent acts,” the statement said. Eating out in Hong Kong: Protesters declare eateries ‘yellow’ or ‘blue’ 2 Nov 2019 Eating out in Hong Kong: Protesters declare eateries ‘yellow’ or ‘blue’ 2 Nov 2019 Officers from the Sham Shui Po criminal investigation unit are handling the firebomb attack. It was not clear if any customers were in the restaurant at the time. The ongoing protests were triggered by the now-withdrawn anti-extradition bill in early June, before morphing into a wider movement to fight for more democracy and the establishment of an independent inquiry into police’s handling of the demonstrations. On Sunday, firebombs were tossed at Sheung Shui Police Station in Sha Tau Kok Road, Fanling at 2.49pm. The firebombs exploded near a police van and were quickly put out although part of the vehicle's body was blackened in the incident. Police said no one was injured and no evacuation was needed. On New Year's Eve, six plastic jerry cans of petrol were found along with 51 empty bottles hidden on a hillside near Lion Rock Country Park in Tsz Wan Shan. Police said the amount seized was enough to produce more than 100 petrol bombs, adding that they were to be used to cause chaos at public events around new year. Hours before the seizure of the haul, petrol bombs were hurled outside Lai Chi Kok government offices in a predawn attack. The shutters of the building and the floor were blackened. No one was injured. Officers seized shards of glass and bottles suspected to contain petrol. Six people dressed in black and wearing hoods were believed to be involved. In November, police found more than 10,000 petrol bombs at several universities after protesters barricaded themselves on campuses and fought officers. In Hong Kong, attempts to cause an explosion or making or keeping explosives with intent to endanger life or property carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in jail under the Crimes Ordinance. 	SCMP

Answering online calls, crowds turned up outside the Revenue Tower in Wan Chai, and on streets in Causeway Bay to chant slogans, while some staged a sit-in at the Kowloon Commerce Centre in Kwai Chung. A group of insurance workers and musicians in Kwun Tong set up a street booth to sign people up for their work unions, the Hong Kong Music Industry Union, and the Hong Kong Insurance Union. Anti-government protesters believe being part of a union to be an effective way of protecting themselves during future strikes. In Wan Chai, more than 100 people took part in a march, and a financial planner in his 40s, who would only give his name as Tony, said it was his fourth or fifth lunchtime rally. “We still hang in to the movement, protests have become part of our life,” he said. “You can’t expect tens of thousands of people to show up during lunch time.” About a dozen pro-independent activists joined midway through chanting, “Hong Kong independence, the only way out!”  Not everyone joined in with the calls for independence, and Annabelle, an accountant in her 30s, said she did not think it should detract from the main issues. “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion,” she said. “It’s their freedom, but I won’t chant the slogans myself.”  A group of students also took part in the march, with Form Five student David Lee leading the rally at one point.  The 17-year-old said he supported the idea of independence for the city, and said only by breaking away from China could Hong Kong become truly international. “The police made mass arrests last week again in Causeway and Sheung Shui, if we don’t speak up now, the entire movement will die down. So we must have some activities to maintain the momentum,” he added. Marchers from Wan Chai made their way along Hennessy Road to join another group in Causeway Bay. Together, they walked towards Times Square shopping centre, where they chanted slogans before departing. Hong Kong’s lunchtime protests resurgent as hundreds vent anti-government anger across the city 6 Dec 2019 Hong Kong’s lunchtime protests resurgent as hundreds vent anti-government anger across the city 6 Dec 2019  A poster circulated on the internet called for those who attended to wear face masks to prevent “prevalent bacteria”, a reference to the pneumonia outbreak in the central mainland China city of Wuhan, which many fear could spread to Hong Kong. But police and government have accused protesters of wearing masks to hide their identities and, for some, to evade criminality. A law banning people covering their faces was ruled unconstitutional by a Hong Kong court in November. The government’s appeal will be heard on Thursday this week. Monday’s protest came a day after a rally in Sheung Shui ended in chaos. Protesters took to the border town to vent their frustration at parallel traders, both from the mainland and Hong Kong, who buy products in the city and resell them at a higher price across the border. Local residents were also unhappy that many shops in the neighbourhood had been turned into pharmacies and cosmetic shops to cater to mainland shoppers and traders, disregarding their needs. Police began advancing on protesters outside Sheung Shui Centre and arresting them after 4pm, after they said another group of demonstrators had hurled petrol bombs at the Sheung Shui Police Station. But Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting, who was among the organisers, called the police operation “outrageous”, and said the approved march was due to last until 5pm, and had been conducted in a peaceful and orderly manner.

Despite having no experience in Hong Kong affairs, Luo, former party leader of Shanxi province, said the city was “no stranger” to him. “I will do my best in the job with a sincere affection towards Hong Kong,” he said. The reshuffle, announced on Saturday, is the first major leadership change since the ongoing protests broke out in June, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. Luo, who has reached the retirement age of 65, took up the role a week after he was named deputy director of the financial and economic affairs committee of the National People’s Congress (NPC) – a position usually reserved for retired officials. “In the past six months, the situation in Hong Kong has been heart-wrenching. We earnestly hope Hong Kong can return to the right track,” he said, while also quoting President Xi Jinping as saying in his new year remarks that there would not be a peaceful home without a harmonious and stable environment. Xi Jinping  Luo did not mention any strategies on achieving that during a five-minute speech at his workplace, after which he did not take questions. Dozens detained by police after march against parallel traders in Hong Kong’s Sheung Shui Dozens detained by police after march against parallel traders in Hong Kong’s Sheung Shui The new chief also backed Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and maintained that one country, two systems – the framework under which Beijing governed Hong Kong – provided the best advantages for the city. Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor “It is believed that with the efforts of Chief Executive Carrie Lam, the government and various sectors in society, the constitution and Basic Law can be fully implemented.” he said.  “One country, two systems will be implemented steadily in the long-term, and the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong can be maintained. I’m fully confident in this.” Beijing’s top official in Hong Kong shrugs off doubts over future by thanking ‘reporter friends’ for their concern 3 Dec 2019 Beijing’s top official in Hong Kong shrugs off doubts over future by thanking ‘reporter friends’ for their concern 3 Dec 2019 Luo also said China recognised Hong Kong people’s important contributions to the nation’s opening up and modernisation and that Beijing had been the “strongest backer” of the city.  Major pro-establishment parties said the new chief had not yet scheduled meetings with them. Various sources in the pro-Beijing camp believed Luo would meet the liaison office’s internal departments in the next few days, before contacting government officials and political parties. They said Luo was expected to attend an NPC preparatory meeting in Zhuhai next Wednesday to meet Hong Kong deputies and would return to the city at night to see pro-Beijing groups at a spring reception held by the liaison office. Luo’s appointment was announced on Saturday by Xinhua news agency, which did not indicate reasons for the change. It is possible that Beijing values his experience in resolving political crises in provincial affairs more than his familiarity with Hong Kong Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of semi-official think tank A source told the Post that Wang had gone to Beijing, and would act as deputy chief of the Central Institute for Party History and Literature Research, which looks into Marxist theories, Xi Jinping Thought and the writings of leaders. Post While most of the liaison office’s previous directors were bureaucrats who worked in the central government before taking up the Hong Kong post, Luo, who has a PhD in economics, is the first head with rich experience in provincial affairs, serving as party secretary in two less-developed provinces, Qinghai and Shanxi. He was said to have impressed the top leadership by swiftly weeding out corruption and overhauling the Shanxi government. Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of semi-official think tank the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said Luo’s lack of experience in Hong Kong would not hinder his work. “It is possible that Beijing values his experience in resolving political crises in provincial affairs more than his familiarity with Hong Kong,” he said. Stanley Ng Chau-pei, a Hong Kong deputy to the NPC and president of the pro-Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, recognised Luo’s work in handling complicated issues on the mainland. He believed it would help Luo bring in new constructive solutions, especially in enhancing economic integration between Hong Kong and mainland cities. But a pro-establishment heavyweight disagreed with his allies and said Luo’s provincial experience was irrelevant. “Managing mainland provinces well doesn’t mean he is capable of tackling problems in Hong Kong, as the liaison office only has an advisory role in Hong Kong matters,” he said. “The essence is whether the official respects the autonomy of the Hong Kong administration when devising strategies to de-escalate the tension.” In New Year’s Eve speech, Xi Jinping ‘hopes for the best’ for Hong Kong in 2020 In New Year’s Eve speech, Xi Jinping ‘hopes for the best’ for Hong Kong in 2020 A source familiar with the operation of the liaison office said Wang’s departure was a gesture to hold him accountable for the pro-establishment camp’s crushing defeat in November’s district council elections. The bloc lost heavily, winning just 60 out of 452 seats across the city. district council elections He said Wang had made an inaccurate assessment of public opinion. “He expected a substantial number of voters to support pro-establishment candidates in the wake of the escalation of violence in protests. But the scenario didn’t happen,” the source said. Lawmaker Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu, leader of the opposition Civic Party, said Wang should have been held accountable for his unsatisfactory performance long before the political tension escalated. Yeung said he would observe whether there was any change in strategy in handling protesters. 	SCMP

Nor is it untrue to say that she reaped the biggest windfall from Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s ill-fated extradition law. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen Chinese President Xi Jinping Who would have expected that in just one year, the island’s leader, whom many had thought might never make it to a second term after her independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party’s humiliating defeat in the 2018 local elections, would see a turnaround in her fortunes all because of what Xi has said and Carrie Lam has done? Democratic Progressive Party’s humiliating defeat It was a grim-faced Tsai who led a group of party officials in a bow to supporters as she announced her resignation as the party’s leader after her ruling DPP suffered its biggest electoral defeat in history in the local government polls on November 24, 2018. “I will take complete responsibility for the outcome of today’s local elections,” Tsai said at the time. “I resign as DPP chairperson. Our efforts weren’t enough and we let down all our supporters who fought with us. I want to express our most sincere apologies.” Taiwan president rejects ‘one country, two systems’ Taiwan president rejects ‘one country, two systems’ DPP lost its traditional stronghold in the city of Kaohsiung for the first time in 20 years and suffered a resounding defeat in the island’s second-largest city Taichung. Overall, the party retained control in just six cities and counties, compared with the 15 won by the mainland-friendly Kuomintang (KMT). The local elections were seen as a midterm test for Tsai, as she faced a backlash over domestic reforms and concerns about deteriorating ties with China.  The KMT’s Han Kuo-yu – who will be Tsai’s major challenger in Saturday’s presidential election – was hailed at the time as the party’s saviour, as his popularity spilled over to other KMT candidates. Han Kuo-yu “No one expected she would be able to turn the tables, given such a grim situation for the DPP and her flagging popularity due to her unpopular reforms at that time,” said Fan Shih-ping, a professor of political science at National Taiwan Normal University.  But in just a year, Tsai has turned herself into the front-runner in the race, going from trailing Han by at least 30 percentage points in the opinion polls to a comfortable lead of more than 20 points over the populist Kaohsiung mayor. Before May last year, Han had been seen as likely to become the island’s next leader, Fan said. But Tsai, 63, who has 15 years’ experience as a trade negotiator and led Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council before heading the DPP, has proved herself to be a shrewd tactician. At the start of last year, she turned remarks by Xi into an opportunity to reverse her political fortunes.  In January, the Chinese president, whose administration regards Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to reclaim it, proposed that the two sides send representatives for unification talks under the “one country, two systems” model now applied in Hong Kong and Macau. use of force to reclaim it Tsai immediately rejected the proposal, saying no one in Taiwan wanted “one country, two systems”, given its disastrous application in Hong Kong. Tsai immediately rejected the proposal Against the backdrop of Xi’s proposal, Tsai has successfully reframed the 2020 poll as a vote to save Taiwan from being annexed by the mainland and islanders from losing their ability to identify themselves as Taiwanese, according to observers. “That [changing of the narrative] has diverted voters’ attention from her unpopular labour and pension reforms,” said Wang Kung-yi, a professor of political science at Chinese Culture University in Taipei. Tsai had launched three “smokeless” wars to achieve her bid for a second four-year term, he said. The first was a psychological war – playing to voters’ worries about a mainland takeover, while the second was a media war designed to trigger voter anger over a campaign of disinformation allegedly orchestrated by Beijing to interfere with Taiwan’s internal affairs and elections, Wang said. The third was a legislative war designed to draw the public’s attention to the need to revise or institute security laws to strengthen the island’s safety network against possible mainland political infiltration and a takeover, Wang said. “All these help build up the impression that Tsai is the one to safeguard Taiwan from a Chinese takeover – a situation that would [be] possible if Han – seen as a mainland-friendly candidate – was elected president.” Tsai Ing-wen says Taiwan faces ‘threat’ from Beijing ahead of presidential election Tsai Ing-wen says Taiwan faces ‘threat’ from Beijing ahead of presidential election Tsai has been able to pursue this strategy because Xi gave her the ammunition to do so, analysts say. “She was smart enough to pick up the gun from Xi Jinping after the mainland leader proposed cross-strait unification talks with one country, two systems as the framework for the future union,” said Yen Chen-shen, a senior research fellow at National Chengchi University’s Institute of International Relations. “Then Carrie Lam’s failed attempt to push through the extradition bill, which ignited months of anti-government protests, allowed her to pick up an even more powerful gun to play up the sense of crisis over a possible Chinese takeover if she lost the election to Han.” The now-withdrawn extradition bill would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. The protests have broadened into an anti-government movement that shows no sign of abating after seven months of unrest. seven months of unrest Since June, Tsai’s campaign has been able to argue that “Hong Kong today will become Taiwan tomorrow” to emphasise to voters that fantasising about a warm relationship with Beijing is out of the question because the island would end up being swallowed by the mainland. “Over the past few years, China’s diplomatic offensives, military coercion, interference and infiltration have continued unabated,” Tsai said in her New Year’s Day speech. New Year’s Day speech “China’s objective is clear: to force Taiwan to compromise our sovereignty. Moreover, at the beginning of last year, China’s President Xi Jinping proposed the one country, two systems model for Taiwan,” she said. “Over the past six months, the world has seen how the situation in Hong Kong has continued to deteriorate under one country, two systems … Hong Kong’s people have shown us that one country, two systems is absolutely not viable.” Tsai’s painting of herself as the leader best equipped to safeguard Taiwan’s sovereignty has received strong approval from young voters who tend to be patriotic and idealistic, analysts said. “She has been able to use the Hong Kong unrest to spin the mainland threat, which helps consolidate not only the support from pro-independence supporters, but also young people who are born Taiwan-centric and tend to be more idealistic,” said Niu Tse-hsun, a professor at Chinese Culture University. Getting the support of young voters is considered a must for victory in the presidential and legislative elections that will be held concurrently on Saturday. According to the latest survey by Taipei-based Commonwealth magazine, 82.4 per cent of people aged 20-29 identified themselves as Taiwanese, while 49.4 per cent thought Taiwan should declare independence. Commonwealth Overall, 58.1 per cent of respondents supported maintaining the status quo, while 27.2 per cent wanted independence and 6.2 per cent wanted unification with the mainland. The same survey of 1,076 people found that 90 per cent felt the one country, two systems model was not applicable in Taiwan. Analysts said Tsai’s efforts to position herself as an open-minded leader on issues such as LGBT rights – Taiwan became the first place in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage earlier this year – have won her popular support among young voters. “She knows how to interact with young people, and her somewhat serious yet carefree attitude in chatting with the young people through social media networks have made her an idol for hundreds and thousands of fans,” Niu said. Tsai has more than 2.5 million Facebook fans. Analysts said the United States’ strong support for Taiwan in the past few years has also boosted Tsai’s confidence that she can beat Han as well as People First Party Chairman James Soong Chu-yu, who declared his candidacy in November, just two months ahead of the poll. “Various legislations and policies introduced by the US have greatly benefited Tsai in her election campaign,” said Michael You Ying-lung, chairman of Taiwan Opinion Foundation in Taipei. He referenced US President Donald Trump’s signing of the Taiwan Travel Act and the National Defence Authorisation Act to bring about high-level visits and exchanges by government and military officials as well as the approval of billions of US dollars worth of arms sales for the island. “Our relations with the US have been the best ever,” Tsai said at a campaign rally, playing up her success at securing strong ties between Taipei and Washington. The US switched diplomatic allegiance to Beijing from Taipei in 1979, but maintains substantive relations with the island, including the provision of arms to counter mainland military threats. Though Washington has said it maintains a policy of non-involvement in Taiwan’s elections and has no preference regarding who becomes its next leader, the Trump administration has been outspoken in accusing Beijing of attempting to influence Taiwan’s election through disinformation and intimidation.

Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said the city’s lingering social unrest had been eroding its international reputation and competitiveness. Violent protests over the past seven months had also taken away the “sense of safety” Hongkongers used to be proud of, he lamented. Hong Kong has been rocked by protests, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, since June last year. The opposition to the bill has morphed into wider and often-violent anti-government protests. In a piece posted on his official blog, Chan hit out at the radicals for vandalising the High Court in Admiralty during the New Year’s Day protest. The protesters had scribbled the name of a judge, Madam Justice Anthea Pang Po-kam, on an outer wall of the court building, accusing her to be a judge with “red background” – suggesting she was pro-Beijing.  Chan wrote in his blog: “Such acts gravely undermine the rule of law. Those responsible will have to be brought to justice.” He said Hong Kong’s economic achievements were “the fruits of the hard work of several generations of people”. Referring to the protesters’ slogan “If we burn, you burn with us”, he said: “Burning together is to destroy the efforts made by the previous generations.” Two top legal bodies express outrage over High Court vandalism 2 Jan 2020 Two top legal bodies express outrage over High Court vandalism 2 Jan 2020 Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah echoed Chan’s views and condemned the vandalism of the High Court and the personal attack on Madam Justice Pang.  “It is bewildering what such acts could achieve except a futile attempt to undermine the very core values that we cherish and respect,” she wrote.  Cheng described judicial independence as the key building block to society. “These rampant acts and statements … will not in any way affect the decision-making process in court proceedings, nor will they affect our judicial independence,” she wrote. While the city’s courts have been largely left untouched by radical protesters, the judiciary has come under increasing criticism recently from both the pro-democracy and pro-Beijing camps over rulings involving protesters. The protesters have accused the courts of favouring the government in cases, while the pro-government side has said the courts have been “too lenient” on the radicals. Police freeze HK$70 million raised by Spark Alliance for protesters 20 Dec 2019 Police freeze HK$70 million raised by Spark Alliance for protesters 20 Dec 2019 The January 1 protests also saw the two iconic lion sculptures outside the HSBC headquarters in Central being vandalised by radicals, as they vented their anger at the banking giant for closing a fundraising account meant for them. Last month, police froze more than HK$70 million (US$9 million) in the account and arrested four members of a group called Spark Alliance HK for money laundering. In his blog piece on Sunday, Secretary for Labour and Welfare Law Chi-kwong expressed sorrow over the vandalism. He said he had worked at the HSBC headquarters after graduation from university and he would say “goodbye to the lions” when he left office everyday. 	SCMP

The rally on Sunday kicked off at a Sheung Shui park, with marchers taking to the main streets of the town in a movement against what they saw as groups who were causing a nuisance in their neighbourhood. The area has many clusters of pharmacies and cosmetic shops, which were closed ahead of the march. Parallel traders are those who buy products in the city and sell them at a higher price on the mainland for a profit. They include both mainland Chinese people and Hongkongers. “Patriots should use China-made products, do not parallel trade!” the crowd chanted. Dozens detained by police after march against parallel traders in Hong Kong’s Sheung Shui Dozens detained by police after march against parallel traders in Hong Kong’s Sheung Shui The march was organised by several district councillors from the Democratic Party and some residents’ groups. Organisers said about 10,000 people showed up, while police put the figure at 2,500 at its peak.  At around 2.40pm, soon after the procession set off, officers said another group of demonstrators hurled petrol bombs at Sheung Shui Police Station – located in Fanling and almost half an hour’s walk from the protest route – which prompted the force to fire tear gas in return. A police vehicle had been blackened, the force said in a Facebook post. Tensions flared outside Metropolis Plaza in Sheung Shui at around 3.40pm when riot police pointed pepper spray at journalists and the protesters from the march, asking them to leave immediately, and saying that the crowd had diverted from their authorised route. The blue flag was raised several times to warn people they were taking part in an unlawful assembly. Following repeated warnings, riot police advanced towards protesters outside Sheung Shui Centre mall after 4pm, pepper-spraying and arresting dozens of them.  About 20 plain-clothes and masked officers, alongside scores of riot police, also entered the mall and used pepper spray to disperse crowds gathered there. One man was seen being taken away.

Organisers said parallel trading was usually more rampant during the festive period.  Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting, who was among organisers, called the police operation “outrageous”. “Our march was conducted in a peaceful and orderly manner, and it takes time for the protesters to disperse,” he said.  Lam said protesters had reached the march’s destination point at around 3pm but had approval to hold the rally till 5pm. “I don’t see why police have to rush in and make arrests,” he said. “There were passers-by as well [outside Sheung Shui Centre] ... I believe police may have wrongly arrested those innocent people.” Two arrested as parallel trading protests descend into chaos 14 Jul 2019 Two arrested as parallel trading protests descend into chaos 14 Jul 2019 By 5.30pm, officers released some 20 people whom they had earlier intercepted outside Sheung Shui Centre. Others who were arrested were taken away on a coach. One march-goer, who only gave his surname as Chan and who was stopped by officers, accused police of arresting people indiscriminately. He said protesters had to pass by the shopping centre, located near the march destination, to disperse. “I do not understand why I was detained. Is it illegal to wear a mask?” he said, adding he wore a face covering but had not even dressed in black – the colour of protesters – or brought along any gas masks. Chan said officers conducted bag and body searches on them and recorded their personal details before letting them go. But in a Facebook post, police said some protesters had ignored their repeated requests of dispersal from the shopping centre and committed a breach of the peace at around 4pm by setting up barricades with umbrellas and besieging some passers-by. The force said it had intercepted some people and arrested others for unlawful assembly at around 4.15pm to prevent the situation from worsening. By 7pm, a total of 47 people had been arrested, mostly over unlawful assembly, a police source said.

This is our home.” The office worker urged the Hong Kong government to limit the number of mainland tourists allowed to visit the city, changing the “one trip per week” policy for Shenzhen residents to “eight trips per year”. He said many shops in the area had started selling pharmaceutical or cosmetic products to mainland Chinese traders, making it difficult for local residents to buy daily groceries. “For the past many years, the streets of Sheung Shui have been jam packed with parallel traders,” he said.

All of the city’s eight publicly funded institutions told the Post students and staff would have to show or scan their university cards before being allowed onto campus, with security guards at entrances and patrolling sites across Hong Kong. Post In November, protesters entered at least six universities, and blocked nearby roads, and vandalised buildings. Laboratories at three universities were broken into, with dangerous materials stolen and research projects affected. dangerous materials stolen and research projects affected Education minister Kevin Yeung Yun-hung later suggested universities needed to improve their management and consider restricting entry into campuses and dormitories. Chinese University’s (CUHK) campus in Sha Tin suffered some of the worst damage, leaving it with a repair bill of some HK$70 million. The second semester begins on Monday, and the university said staff, students and alumni are required to present their university ID cards before entry. Visitors would be required to register their personal information, or have a permit issued by the university before entering.  CUHK has also appointed a security consultant to review security measures at laboratory buildings, a spokeswoman said, adding security at student dormitories would also be constantly reviewed. At Polytechnic University, which had it’s Hung Hom campus heavily damaged by protesters during a 13-day stand-off with police, students returning for the start of term on January 13 will find access strictly controlled. Hong Kong's PolyU siege : From beginning to end Hong Kong's PolyU siege : From beginning to end Turnstiles have also been installed at the campus’ three main entrances, and university ID cards will be needed for entry, although questions have been raised over whether turnstiles installed at an entrance which leads to public open space could breach land grant conditions.  The conditions state that the land must be accessible to the public between 7am and midnight, and the Lands Department and university have said they are working to find a solution.  Having reopened in stages since mid-December, a spokeswoman for PolyU said an executive task force had been set up to “comprehensively review and enhance” safety and security measures on campus as well as in student hostels. Owan Li, a Year Four student majoring in Social Policy and Administration, and student representative on the institution's governing council, did not believe the tightened security measures should be implemented for the whole of the term. “One of the major values of universities is to be open and free,” he said. “But these security measures are just making PolyU isolating itself from the outside world and have been contradicting with [these values].” City University students also start their new term next week, and the Kowloon Tong campus has also been surrounded by hoarding panels. Students and staff have to show relevant identification upon entry, while visitors need to preregister under the university’s electronic system and show a QR code to security guards for verification. Fung Wai-wah, a senior lecturer and member of CityU’s council, believes the security measures are disproportionate and thinks there is a lower risk that campuses would be targeted by protesters again after two months. “For security check at entrances, during rush hour a queue is usually formed and we have to wait to get in. A bottleneck may be formed when there are many people, and students might become late for classes even if they did originally arrive on time,” Fung said. The Education Bureau said universities had a responsibility to implement suitable security measures, while balancing the impact on normal activities on campus. It said the University Grants Committee, the funding body for the eight publicly funded universities in Hong Kong, had not imposed any mandatory regulations on campus access control or reopening arrangements, adding the bureau would continue to be in close contact with universities over campus facilities’ management.

And it seems their tarnished real-life image is being reflected by a drop in their popularity on the big screen. Moviegoers are shunning Hong Kong’s signature cops-and-robbers films, traditionally the backbone of the local industry, resulting in several recent flops and contributing to a slump at the box office in recent months. Riot police have been widely accused of using “excessive force” against protesters, though they deny this, claiming their actions have always been proportional to the threat they themselves are facing.   The public’s reluctance to watch the police portrayed in a positive light on screen when distrust is running at a record high is one strand of a double blow being inflicted on Hong Kong’s cinemas by the political crisis gripping the city. The other is that residents are avoiding cinemas located in shopping malls, which have become one of the main flashpoints for outbreaks of violence and vandalism. The latter has had a dramatic effect on box office receipts over the festive period.  The city’s Christmas cinema revenues tumbled by 28.1 per cent to HK$29 million (US$4 million) between December 24 and 26 from the same period in 2018, figures from industry data provider Hong Kong Box Office Limited (HKBO) show. Overall, box office income in the second half of last year declined by 10 per cent to HK$877 million from the same period a year before.    An absence of successful crime thrillers featuring police – a pillar genre of Hong Kong cinema that dates back to the 1970s – will not have helped. Three such movies released after the protests gained momentum in August flopped at the box office, in stark contrast with a boom in the genre earlier in the year.  It came as public support for the police force – once considered Asia’s finest – almost halved to 35 per cent in November from a year earlier, according to surveys by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute. That represents its lowest level since the polls began in 2012, a result of a widespread perception of police brutality during the protests. almost halved  “[Cops-and-robbers] is one of Hong Kong cinema’s signature genres, like Infernal Affairs is such a big thing here, there was a certain fascination with the genre – more so than anywhere else – because Hong Kong was such a safe place,” said Kevin Ma, an independent film critic and writer. Infernal Affairs “But people’s impression of the police has changed radically in the past half year. Obviously they are not in a mood to see positive depictions of the police at the moment, because the sentiment is so low.”   The hit movie Infernal Affairs, released in 2002, is the story of a police officer who infiltrates a triad gang. Widely regarded as a high-water mark for Hong Kong’s filmmaking industry, it earned numerous awards and spawned an Oscar-winning Hollywood remake called The Departed starring Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson. Infernal Affairs Six crime thrillers released between February and early August – when the violence in the protests intensified – raked in a combined HK$85 million in box office revenue, helped by blockbuster hits such as Integrity, which was the top-grossing local film in 2019, starring A-listers Sean Lau Ching-wan and Nick Cheung Ka-fai. In comparison, the three films in this genre released later in the year only bagged HK$7.7 million. Integrity Massive street demonstrations that erupted in June have engulfed Hong Kong in its worst political crisis in decades. The economy spiralled into a technical recession in the third quarter, after frequent protests in major shopping districts hammered the retail and tourism sectors. Over 300 protesters were arrested in three days of violent clashes at several major shopping malls over Christmas. Chinese national day holiday box office winners and losers 2 Oct 2019 Chinese national day holiday box office winners and losers 2 Oct 2019 The local entertainment industry is struggling to cope with the downturn. Even before the social unrest, Hong Kong cinema had already been in steady decline since its heyday in the 1990s, when as many as 400 films were produced each year. In 2019, local producers made just 46 films, down from 53 in 2018, according to the HKBO. 400 films “The general mood in the industry is that people don’t really know what kind of films are appropriate to make, and what films could we make to get people back into the cinema,” said Ma, who also runs film news website, Asia in Cinema. It is natural for creatives to become more cautious in this environment, he added. This has already led to project suspension and cancellations. Local actress Michelle Wai Si-nga had three movie projects postponed indefinitely because of the unrest, while actor Carlos Chan Ka-lok went back to school for acting training after two movies were suspended. A handful of cops-and-robbers films previously marketed for 2019 did not make it to the big screen as scheduled. Detective vs Sleuths, for example, was supposed to be released in December, according to earlier announcements by producer Emperor Motion Pictures. It is unclear why the movie, starring Sean Lau, has not been launched yet. The company did not reply to requests for comment. Detective vs Sleuths Its rich heritage is unquestioned, but Hong Kong cinema faces uncertain future 20 Jul 2018 Its rich heritage is unquestioned, but Hong Kong cinema faces uncertain future 20 Jul 2018 A slowdown in China’s entertainment industry last year following a nationwide crackdown on tax evasion could have had a ripple effect on Hong Kong too, because the city is dwarfed by the mainland in terms of market size and industry resources. Mainland Chinese production houses may have become more reluctant to partner with their Hong Kong peers to produce any film involving sensitive topics such as the police. For now, how well the box office will perform over the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday at the end of January will be key to shoring up the industry’s confidence, Ma said. “Generally Chinese New Year is the sure-fire bet,” he said. “It really depends on whether those films succeed ... and then the industry will see, is it that the quality of the films [is bad], or is it that people just don’t want to go to the movies anymore. And if people don’t go to the movies even for the Chinese New Year, then what can we do?” 	SCMP

I hope more councillors will attend.”  However, responses from the pan-democrats left Cheung’s vision in tatters. Pro-democracy bloc members of nine district councils have made clear they would snub the meeting. Three political parties — the Democratic Party, Civic Party and Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People’s Livelihood — also declared they would join the boycott.  In a statement, the Democratic Party, the largest party in the camp holding 91 seats across different districts, called the arrangements for the meeting insincere and ridiculous.  “The government is sending Cheung to meet the elected councillors. But it was Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor who met the defeated ones in person. It is ridiculous,” it wrote.

Some of the remaining districts said internal discussions were still underway, with a proportion saying attendance would be for individuals to decide, although a mass rebuff was widely expected. Ching Cheung-ying, the new chairman of Sha Tin district council, said he preferred giving councillors a free choice. “Some might want to go and express concerns over the issue of police brutality. But I guess we all face a struggle. Facing the broken government, do they really care about our opinion or we will just be used by the authorities?” he said.    The chairman of the Sai Kung district council Chung Kam-lun, of the Neo Democrats, also said he understood there was no appetite from his colleagues to turn up.

Luo Huining, the former party leader of Shanxi province, has been named as the new director of the central government’s liaison office in the city, Xinhua reported. It is understood that Wang, who is blamed in some quarters for the unrest, will be given a dignified exit. He will be recalled to Beijing and reassigned to another position unrelated to Hong Kong affairs, according to a source familiar with the discussion. Wang’s new nomination will be announced later. The source said the reshuffle should not be seen as a punishment for Wang but a change of strategy. Luo’s appointment came as a surprise. Having reached the retirement age of 65 in October, he was just named on December 28 as the deputy director of the financial and economic affairs committee of the national people’s congress – a position usually reserved for retired officials.  Luo has never held any position directly related to Hong Kong before. Apart from one business trip to Hong Kong in 2018, he has no known connections here. But the soft-speaking politician is known as a capable administrator. He served for more than a decade in China’s far-flung western province Qinghai – one of the poorest regions populated by ethnic minorities.  Luo rose through the ranks from deputy governor to governor and eventually the party secretary position. In 2016, he was given a tough assignment as the party secretary of the resource-rich central province Shanxi that was rocked by corruption scandals.  There Luo excelled himself and impressed the top leadership by swiftly weeding out corruption and overhauling the government. He is among a selected few Chinese officials who could boast the experience of having managed two provinces, each with the population of a midsized European country. Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos He will be the first Hong Kong liaison director with such rich local experience. Most of his predecessors were specialist bureaucrats who worked in the central government before taking up the Hong Kong assignment. Almost three hours after the Xinhua announcement, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor issued a statement, extending a welcome to Luo and thanking Wang for providing staunch support to her government’s efforts to “curb violence and uphold the rule of law” over the past seven months. Luo was not a household name among the pro-Beijing camp in the city. A veteran deputy to the National People’s Congress said he had no idea even of the gender and spelling of Luo’s name when he heard the announcement on Saturday. Beijing’s man in Hong Kong shrugs off questions from ‘reporter friends’ 3 Dec 2019 Beijing’s man in Hong Kong shrugs off questions from ‘reporter friends’ 3 Dec 2019 A source said that was his strength in dealing with the difficult stakeholders in Hong Kong. “One key consideration is that Luo does not have connections with Hong Kong’s business and other community, therefore his work will not be complicated by any relationship,” the source said. Li Xiaobing, an expert on Beijing’s policies on Hong Kong at Nankai University in Tianjin, said the choice highlighted Beijing’s will to break the deadlock in Hong Kong. “The problem of choosing someone from the Hong Kong and Macau system is they will be constrained by the existing frameworks and relationships,” he said. “His past experiences showed that he is capable of providing out-of-box solutions.”   Luo, who held a PhD in Economics, is known for his efforts in curbing corruption and boosting economies in less-developed regions in Anhui, Qinghai and Shanxi. A Shanxi official who had worked under Luo told the Post: “He seldom raises his voice. But he is very determined and demanding when he wants to get things done. No jokes.” Post Political commentator Johnny Lau Yui-siu believed the appointment also showed Beijing’s approach to promote stronger economic cooperation between Hong Kong and mainland Chinese cities. But he believed there would be no fundamental changes in the present strategies for handling protesters. ‘Key moment to stop Hong Kong protest chaos’: Beijing’s liaison office 25 Dec 2019 ‘Key moment to stop Hong Kong protest chaos’: Beijing’s liaison office 25 Dec 2019 Luo’s only known visit to Hong Kong was in December 2018, when he led a delegation from Shanxi to promote investment opportunities to the city’s business sector. In the meeting with Lam, Luo described Hong Kong as a “gold mine” and praised its unique role in facilitating China’s economic reform and opening the country up. He pledged to raise economic cooperation between Hong Kong and Shanxi to a strategic level. He also met Wang Zhimin during that trip.   Wang was liaison office director since September 2017. His term of two years and three months made him the shortest-serving head of the office since the return of Hong Kong to the mainland. Before taking the position in Hong Kong, he served as director of the liaison office in Macau for around a year.

Lam Tsz-king, the party’s North district councillor, who was given a letter of no objection by police on Friday, said the march was intended to escalate pressure on law enforcement bodies after last weekend’s protest “had achieved preliminary results”. “The action has scared away some parallel traders and mainland shoppers over the week,” she said. “But every year before Lunar New Year, parallel trading activities will become rampant and cause a huge nuisance to residents. We call on the police’s task force to take effective measures to deal with the problem.” The party held a protest with similar demands last January, and Sunday’s event will be led by the party’s four district councillors, and residents’ groups concerned by parallel trading. The organisers will hold an assembly in Sheung Shui No 1 Garden at 1.30pm, with the march expected to start at 2.30pm from Sheung Shui MTR station to San Wan Road, passing main streets where clusters of pharmacies and shops selling skincare products are situated.  Around 3,000 people are expected to take part in the march, organisers told police. When asked how they would try to prevent the rally ending in clashes like last weekend, when hundreds of people went “shopping” in Landmark North and police ended up using pepper spray, Lam said the party would arrange about 100 marshals to help maintain control.  “We do not encourage participants to trash the shops and clash with shoppers from the mainland,” Lam said. “But, at the same time, we urge the police to show restraint in our peaceful demonstrations.”   She also hoped police would not end the march at short notice, as they did on New Year’s Day, saying it would only lead to protesters taking more radical action.  Meanwhile, the Civil Rights Observer group said all three of its members arrested during Wednesday’s unrest had been released on bail on Friday night, after being detained for two days. It said their belongings including work uniforms, protective gear, smart phones and cameras had been taken by the police.

Matthew Connors was detained for four hours and questioned by immigration officers before being sent back to New York early on Friday morning. The former head of Massachusetts College of Art and Design’s photography department said it was the third time he had travelled to Hong Kong since anti-government protests erupted in June, and believed the decision to deny him entry was taken before he even arrived. “Immigration officers told me repeatedly that based on the interview they conducted with me I did not ‘meet the immigration requirements’,” Connors said. “I asked them to be more specific several times, but they would not provide more information. “The interview was also strangely informal. The immigration officers seemed indifferent to most of my answers, taking lacklustre notes, though they asked the most follow up questions about the book I published about the Egyptian Revolution.” Connors won the International Center of Photography’s Infinity Award in 2016 for his book, Fire in Cairo, which dealt with the rapid social change in Egypt. Fire in Cairo  The photography professor has also covered the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York, and his photographs in North Korea were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2018. He visited Hong Kong in August and September last year to cover the unrest as an independent journalist, and was detained by police on his first visit, although he was not charged.  The Immigration Department declined to comment on the case.  “In handling each immigration case, the Immigration Department will, having regard to the circumstances pertaining to each individual case, decide whether the entry will be allowed or refused in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong and prevailing immigration policies,” it said in a statement. Connors said he was saddened by the incident, which he said was evidence of the “further erosion of freedoms” in Hong Kong. “I’ve drawn a lot of inspiration from Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement these past 7 months and feel lucky to have glimpsed the deep currents of creativity and fervour that are fuelling the demonstrators’ demands for greater agency over their futures,” he said. “The prospect that I may never be able to return is weighing on me.” 	SCMP

Of the 134 respondents from the “vulnerable group” – journalists and property management staff, who were more likely to be exposed to social unrest – 29.8 per cent showed signs of depression and 28 per cent had symptoms of anxiety. “Their ratios of having such problems were much higher than ordinary people,” said Dr Phyllis Chan Kwok-ling, the college’s vice-president of general affairs. Of the 118 members of the public surveyed, 22.3 per cent showed signs of depression and 25.9 per cent exhibited anxiety. Hong Kong has been rocked by protests and clashes between protesters and police since June, triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill. Violent scenes and vandalism of public and private property have been commonplace on the streets and in newspapers in the seven months since. a now-withdrawn extradition bill vandalism of public and private property Hong Kong protests continue to batter retail sector as sales plunge 23.6 per cent in November, the second biggest drop on record 3 Jan 2020 Hong Kong protests continue to batter retail sector as sales plunge 23.6 per cent in November, the second biggest drop on record 3 Jan 2020 Chan attributed the survey results to the unrest, noting that the latest findings in depression and anxiety rates were higher than in a citywide survey five years ago.  The Hong Kong Mental Morbidity Survey in 2014 found public anxiety and depression rates were 14 per cent – well below the college’s 2019 survey results for the public, and half that of journalists and property managers.   “This is something we are worried about,” Chan said. “Stress faced by the vulnerable group was long as well as with some acute incidents.”  The Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists has since August run a programme to provide free or subsidised consultations for people suspected to have mental health problems related to the social unrest. Eighty people have been helped by the programme so far, including a seven-year-old boy, the son of a police officer. a police officer. The boy showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and felt down, according to the college.  “Signs of PTSD include staying nervous all day … not able to sleep and having frequent nightmares,” said college president Dr Roger Ng Man-kin, referring to the general condition, not the specific case of the boy. With the current findings, Ng urged the government to provide more mental health support and education resources for Hongkongers. the government “Mental health is equally important to physical health, just like other diseases such as diabetes and hypertension,” he said.

While nearly seven months of social unrest and protest violence have stretched the 30,000-strong force to the limit, forcing officers to constantly work overtime, their compensation for the extra hours and other expenses has come under intense scrutiny. City Weekend looks at the mechanism of the overtime compensation and the controversies behind it. What is the mechanism for police and civil service overtime pay? What is the mechanism for police and civil service overtime pay? Sparked by fierce opposition to the now-withdrawn extradition bill, the protests have since morphed into an often-violent uprising, focusing on calls for greater democracy and police accountability. The Security Bureau last month revealed that the government had paid about 11,000 police officers Disciplined Services Overtime Allowance (DSOA) of up to HK$950 million (US$122 million) over the past six months. That would mean each of them received HK$14,394 a month on average in extra pay since June.  The bureau noted there were rules in place for overtime payments. “Time off in lieu is the normal recompense for OT work performed … Where the granting of time off is, or is likely to be, impracticable within 30 days of the date on which OT work is performed, payment of DSOA to eligible officers may be approved,” it said. While the maximum amount of overtime work a civil servant could undertake was normally 60 hours a month, the bureau added, the force had adjusted the ceiling. But it did not elaborate further.  A police source said the overtime ceiling for Operation Tiderider, launched in June to tackle anti-government protests, was capped at 150 hours per month.   Officers of chief inspector rank or below earn overtime pay, which is calculated by the hour based on their salary, while superintendents or higher-ranked officers only receive compensation leave.  On top of nearly HK$1 billion in overtime claims, a letter from the Civil Service Bureau to the Legislative Council last month revealed officers had received HK$235 million in meals and other allowances during the period. Between June and November, frontline officers and back-end clerical staff, including those who had carried out tasks beyond their job description, were given allowances worth HK$85 million. Another HK$50 million was spent on meals, but officers deployed in the field and unable to get food were later provided with lunch boxes which ran up a further HK$100 million bill, sources said. A police spokesman said the daily rate of food allowance for each person ranged from HK$69 to HK$137. The letter, in response to opposition lawmaker Eddie Chu Hoi-dick’s queries on overtime wages, also explained that members of the disciplined forces could claim “job-related allowances” if they carried out duties beyond their rank and daily work. Another rule in the civil servants’ guidelines permitted allowances to be granted during justifiable, “special and unique” circumstances, the letter said. Those who earned less than HK$105,000 per month were eligible for the allowances, which had been granted to dog trainers, drivers, divers, undercover officers and detectives, as well as personnel responsible for protecting public officials. What are the controversies involved? What are the controversies involved? Opposition legislators have said they would fight tooth and nail to stop the government from giving police overtime pay or a wage increases, arguing they are undeserving because of their conduct in handling the protests amid allegations of brutality. On Thursday, Kwok Cheuk-kin, a former civil servant known for taking the Hong Kong government to court on numerous occasions, lodged a legal challenge against the decision to grant police more than HK$1 billion in overtime pay, arguing it amounted to favourable treatment that violated equality provisions under the city’s mini-constitution, the Basic Law. He argued that other civil servants who clocked extra hours, including judiciary employees, firefighters, doctors, paramedical personnel and cleaning workers, were not similarly compensated. Police associations have countered that officers would rather have regular hours off than work endlessly, and that they would welcome a halt to protest chaos even if it meant no more overtime pay. Manpower has been stretched thin to the extent that extra hands have had to be called in from other disciplined services as special constables, including from the Correctional Services Department. Other protest-hit sectors are demanding similar compensation as they reel from extra workloads. As the police overtime payment was being announced, medical sector lawmaker Pierre Chan Pui-yin took to social media to protest over what he characterised as unequal treatment of health care professionals, who also worked long hours treating people injured in the protests. In a Facebook post, he wrote: “Doctors in Hong Kong have no overtime allowances, because many seniors have told us any time on duty is training.” Hong Kong has long had a workaholic culture, in which employees spend time on the job beyond their contracted hours without adequate compensation. A study released in April last year by the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions showed one in five of the city’s more than 3 million employees worked an average of 55 hours per week last year, or 11 hours a day. The government set up a Standard Working Hours Committee in 2013 to study the matter and overtime compensation. But instead of legislating standard working hours, it has so far only promised to introduce guidelines for 11 industries, citing divergent views from different sectors. But trade unions and lawmakers have called for the government to set up legislation stipulating a standard 44-hour working week. 	SCMP

Trips to the gambling hub spiked at the end of December following celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of its return to Chinese rule, the country’s biggest travel website Ctrip.com said in a report published on Thursday. It also said that Macau’s growing popularity as a shopping destination had further helped to boost visitor numbers. The festive atmosphere in Hong Kong, where Christmas is widely celebrated, makes it a popular destination at this time of year, but the report said six months of political turmoil had seen its appeal diminish.   Statistics from the Hong Kong Immigration Department showed that about 450,000 mainland travellers entered the city between December 21 and 26, with a further 300,000 crossing the border between December 29 and January 1. But this was less than half the total from the previous year, when more than a million visitors arrived between December 21 and 26, and more than 800,000 between December 29 and January 1. Top Chinese official praises Macau, warns Hong Kong to toe constitutional line 4 Dec 2019 Top Chinese official praises Macau, warns Hong Kong to toe constitutional line 4 Dec 2019 Zhuang Zhimin, a tourism researcher from East China Normal University in Shanghai, said many mainland people are not willing to travel to Hong Kong due to safety concerns.  “But I believe it’s a temporary phenomenon that people shun Hong Kong,” he continued. “Macau and Hong Kong have their own special features to lure tourists.” Tuniu, another major travel agency, said the number of mainlanders booking trips to Macau had risen by 60 per cent in 2019 compared with the previous year. The company said the opening of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge at the end of 2018 and Western atmosphere in this former Portuguese colony have helped attract mainland travellers. External forces targeting Macau as well as Hong Kong, Chinese official says 17 Feb 2020 External forces targeting Macau as well as Hong Kong, Chinese official says 17 Feb 2020 One of the mainland tourists who did decide to travel to Hong Kong over Christmas said she had been reassured by friends in the city that it was still safe to visit.  Irene Yang, a property service company manager in Shanghai, said she had been wondering whether to cancel her trip following clashes on a number of university campuses in November.  But the 30-year-old said: “My friends in Hong Kong told me the situation now is not as chaotic or violent as being reported. At least, public transport is all right.”   Ctrip’s report also found that 30 per cent of travellers during this period had been born after 1990. This compared with the 27 per cent for people born in the Eighties and was the first time that more travellers were born after 1990. January 1 is a public holiday on the mainland, but Christmas is not and only some foreign companies give their staff time off during the holiday period. Because of the short holiday period, most travellers stayed in Asia. According to Ctrip, the top five overseas destinations were Thailand, Japan, Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia. Angela Feng, a manager at an accounting firm in Shanghai, went trekking in Nepal between December 25 to January 2. “I love hiking, so I joined an outdoor activity group to Nepal. The country is popular among backpackers in China,” said Feng, who is in her 30s. “It’s good for me to be unreachable for some days because there is no telephone signal in the mountains.” Purchase the China AI Report 2020 brought to you by SCMP Research and enjoy a 20% discount (original price US$400).

Among those who rode the wave of anti-government sentiment in a city gripped by protests since June, the win of part-time convenience store worker Chan Tsz-wai in Jordan South can be said to be the most dazzling, as he spent the least but raked in the most votes, according to a study of available election return records lodged with the Registration and Electoral Office (REO). gripped by protests The election expenses declared by the 27-year-old first-time contender were only HK$13,681 (US$1,756) – 20 per cent of the spending limit of HK$68,800. Yet, Chan ousted Chris Ip Ngo-tung, former chairman of the Yau Tsim Mong District Council and a senior member of the city's wealthiest pro-Beijing party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong. Ip’s expenses were not yet available on Friday as authorities are releasing records in multiple rounds. In the elections on November 25 last year, Chan garnered 1,516 votes, narrowly defeating Ip’s 1,451. elections on November 25  Rather than using tens of thousands of dollars on advertisements or assistants’ salaries, Chan spent money on clothing and hairspray for his public appearances, totalling just HK$1,812. The rest was spread over campaign advertisements, transport and miscellaneous items. The district council elections were seen as a de facto referendum on the five demands of protesters amid a movement sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. The campaign has since morphed into wider demonstrations against the government. extradition bill   A record voter turnout, fuelled by anger against authorities for the handling of the political crisis, saw pro-democracy candidates sweep nearly 90 per cent of seats and take control of 17 out of 18 districts.  The REO required all 1,090 candidates competing for 452 seats citywide to report election expenses and donations by December 29.  After receiving the submissions, the REO has so far unclassified records of 34 candidates for public and media inspection. Asked why he chose instead to splurge on shirts, election winner Chan Tsz-wai said: “As sportswear was my everyday outfit, I never had a proper shirt before the campaign. Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing camp reeling after crushing defeat in district council elections Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing camp reeling after crushing defeat in district council elections “But I took my supporters’ advice to dress up a bit to give an impression to residents that I was serious about running in the race. I attribute all the glory to the sweat and blood of protesters.” Not all pro-democracy candidates were as frugal as Chan, however. Nine-year Southern district incumbent Paul Zimmerman, who was re-elected in the Pok Fu Lam constituency, spent HK$63,627, including HK$6,000 on photo shoots and publicity materials. Zimmerman defeated his rivals Siu Wai-chung and Maxine Yao Jie-ning to win another term. Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, one of the city’s biggest protest figures and convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, was elected in Sha Tin after spending HK$62,638, including more than HK$58,000 on advertising through social media platforms, foam board displays and 44,000 direct-mail pamphlets. In Kwun Tong, first-time pro-democracy candidate Jannelle Rosalynne Leung, 25, spent HK$43,304 as she defeated Hsu Hoi-shan in the Yuet Wah constituency. Not far from where Chan was elected, in the Tsim Sha Tsui West constituency, long-time democracy advocate Frederick Fung Kin-kee, 66, suffered a humiliating drubbing despite having spent HK$59,165. District councillors vow to pursue protesters’ demands in new term 3 Jan 2020 District councillors vow to pursue protesters’ demands in new term 3 Jan 2020 From the available expense returns analysed by the Post, he was the candidate who spent the most money but received the fewest votes by far. Fung nearly lost his deposit of HK$3,000 because of insufficient ballots. Post Although Fung was a former pro-democracy lawmaker, competition in his zone was vicious in a five-horse race that saw Fung’s rival from the same camp, Leslie Chan Ka-long, win by a landslide 48 per cent of the votes. The only pro-Beijing candidate there, Alex Poon King-wo of the DAB, received 38 per cent of ballots. Fung, a seasoned politician, spent part of his election money on 34,500 pamphlets and mailed three rounds of publicity materials to his 3,614 constituents. Advertisements alone cost Fung – who ran as an independent – HK$18,000, not counting the salary of an election agent and temporary workers who handed out pamphlets for him, ringing up another HK$25,000 in costs. Having lost his long-held seat in Sham Shui Po to a pro-establishment rival in 2015, Fung insisted even though he was defeated again last year, he was more diligent than his rivals. “I must be the most hardworking candidate in my constituency. I stood outside residential buildings for six hours every day to greet electors,” he said. For his campaign, Fung chose not to mention the ongoing protests but instead listed his contributions in his “42 years of serving Kowloon West”. He also displayed a photo of himself running in the city’s first district election back in 1983. In contrast, opponent Leslie Chan, 39, a former assistant of Civic Party lawmaker Claudia Mo Man-ching, wrote “five demands, not one less” on the cover of his pamphlets. In defeat, Fung lamented: “All my district contributions and groundwork in reaching out to residents were worth nothing while political demands loomed large amid the movement.” Chinese University political scientist Ivan Choy Chi-keung said spending money on publicity and advertisement ultimately did not matter in the elections, because it was the candidates’ political stances that voters prioritised. “What the candidates have previously done and whether people know about them were not important,” he said. “Many voters cast protest votes by choosing a candidate who held the highest chance, with a single aim to unseat the pro-establishment representative.” But Choy said it was too soon to predict whether the same formula would apply to the Legislative Council elections in September.

But curators at Hong Kong News-Expo, Asia’s first dedicated museum on the subject, said it was still too soon for such a retrospective. The protests – the city’s biggest political crisis since its return from British to Chinese rule – have made international headlines. Peaceful demonstrations as well as violent clashes between masked, black-clad protesters and police have grabbed coverage in newspapers, on radio and television stations, and online. “Such an event is unprecedented in Hong Kong,” said May Chan Suk-mei, vice-chairman of News-Expo. “We will surely stage an exhibition on it, but the time for it is ripe only when comprehensive materials are collected to ensure the exhibition is objective and respects history.” News-Expo opened last December at the renovated former Bridges Street Market in Central, a grade-three historic building from 1953. It took five years of planning and development, at a cost of ﻿HK$85 million in government funding. Apart from the 12 permanent exhibition sections including those on newspapers, radio, television and new media, it has launched six exhibitions based on news events, including the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and the equestrian events of the Beijing Olympics of the same year, which were held in Hong Kong.  Situated in the hub of the city’s earlier newspapers and printers, the site has attracted about 50,000 visitors over the past year, less than the expected 70,000, Chan said, blaming the onset of unrest. More than 30 groups cancelled visits from August to October. Big events like this need time to settle down before we can think about how to exhibit the issue in a comprehensive, objective way Chairman of News-Expo’s programme committee Professor Clement So News-Expo has not steered clear of controversial or politically sensitive issues. It has staged exhibitions on Hong Kong’s 1967 riots, the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing, and the 2014 Occupy movement, in which pro-democracy protesters paralysed parts of Hong Kong for 79 days. “We will exhibit all the big events that have a significant impact on the city and its development to let the public view them from different perspectives,” Chan said.  She said the preparation of the exhibition on the political unrest, sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, would only start after it is over. News-Expo will conduct in-depth research on news coverage of the political turmoil, looking into all media reports from different political perspectives, and consulting historians, sociologists and journalists, she said. They will also conduct interviews with reporters and people involved in the protests. News organisations and their staff have been targeted during the ongoing protests. Some media outlets deemed pro-Beijing, including the city’s largest television station TVB, have been attacked by protesters, while some reporters have accused police of targeting them and obstructing their reporting.  Professor Clement So York-kee, chairman of News-Expo’s programme committee, is confident about the future exhibition, but cautions against rushing into it. “Big events like this need time to settle down before we can think about how to exhibit the issue in a comprehensive, objective way,” he said. The challenge of staging the exhibition lies in the collection of materials, Chan said, given the extensive media coverage. But she promised to be objective and fair in exhibiting media coverage from different political perspectives, to help the public better understand the issue. “Hong Kong is a place where we should respect press freedom, which is a major cornerstone and element in the city’s success,” Chan said. “It is a good thing that different media with different political stances can all exist in the city.” 	SCMP

Peace has been largely restored at the Pok Fu Lam campus, and posters and graffiti bearing pro-democracy messages scrawled all over the campus have been mostly erased. Security checks at entrances are tight, with only students and staff allowed in. Reddy, 21, who asked to be identified only by his surname, says he chose to come to Hong Kong two years ago because of the city’s high academic standards and its international flavour. But a wave of demonstrations and violence on campus have disrupted his studies and made him worried about personal safety. His family back home question his decision to return. “They are worried about me, and they ask, ‘why did you choose this particular place over elsewhere?’” he says. “I did not know it when I chose to study here. I did not know that I signed up for this.” The city’s universities will start welcoming back students next week, including 18,060 non-local students enrolled in the city’s eight universities funded by the University Grants Committee. They account for about 18 per cent of the total student population.  Most non-local students come from mainland China, at 12,322 in the 2018-2019 academic year, followed by 1,479 from South Korea, 731 from Taiwan, 669 from India, 565 from Indonesia, 406 from Malaysia, statistics show. A total of 108 students come from the United States, while 34 students are from Britain. Apart from the University of Hong Kong (HKU), the political turmoil, which has engulfed the city for nearly seven months, has also spilled over to Chinese University (CUHK), Baptist University, City University (CityU), Polytechnic University (PolyU), and the University of Science and Technology (HKUST). CUHK has estimated it will cost HK$70 million (US$8.9 million) to repair the campus, while CityU has said its bill will run into nine figures. it will cost HK$70 million Chinese and local organisations help students from mainland China flee universities in Hong Kong Chinese and local organisations help students from mainland China flee universities in Hong Kong Violent incidents on campuses in November forced universities to cancel classes or end the semester early. Violence at CUHK and PolyU forced non-local students to flee.  The Education Bureau says it does not keep statistics on the number of non-local students who have dropped out. According to CityU, some have decided to cancel their exchange programmes for the new semester which will start on January 13, while other universities say the number of non-local students who have dropped out is similar to previous years.  All six universities have increased the number of security personnel, and at PolyU, the site of a 13-day stand-off between radicals and police, a dedicated task force has been set up to ensure the security of the campus.

The city’s close relationship with mainland China also attracts many. “Hong Kong is one of the most advanced and mature financial hubs in Asia, and it is a portal for foreigners to enter mainland China,” says Reddy, who chose Hong Kong over Singapore and London.

Asking to be identified by only his surname, he says he expects a calmer and friendlier campus where he can devote himself to his research. The MTR station serving the Sha Tin campus was closed for more than a month after protesters vandalised it, while the campus itself was the scene of intense clashes between radicals and police.

But still it is too early to say so, and unexpected things do happen.” CUHK was one of the worst-hit campuses, occupied by radical protesters for four days in November. Protesters threw petrol bombs, bricks and other objects, while the police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds. Many of the university’s more than 3,800 non-local students, including those from Taiwan and South Korea, fled the campus.

Reddy also went home for a week in November, after protesters at HKU set fire to the MTR station, barricaded the campus gates, and threw petrol bombs from a footbridge at people trying to clear the roads. He says more than half of his 70 classmates left the city. Inside the occupied Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus Inside the occupied Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus The violence on campuses forced universities to cancel graduation ceremonies, suspend the semester early and resort to online teaching. But students say live-streaming classes or uploading materials online was ineffective. Celeste, a master’s student at HKU, says the university should have had better arrangements for non-local students who pay for school and accommodation.

The 48-year-old acting auxiliary police superintendent, surnamed Lo, is the first officer to be suspended over misconduct allegations as the city endures its seventh month of increasingly violent turmoil. violent turmoil Lo, assistant divisional commander (auxiliary) of Mong Kok district at the time, is under internal investigation over a photograph and caption – detailing operations in Mong Kok district on Tuesday night – posted on messaging app Telegram, in a group with almost 65,000 members, mainly protesters. The picture, which showed a dozen officers in riot gear and a police vehicle on a road, was suspected to have been taken from height in Mong Kok Police Station. The caption read: “Notification from an auxiliary police friend. Police have ordered frontline [officers] to outflank protesters on Tong Mei Road, Mong Kok Road, Nathan Road and Prince Edward Road … All arrested persons will be sent to Hung Hom Police Station. 100 per cent real. He overheard the radio calls.” A source in the force said Lo was tasked with defending the police station that night and had admitted to taking the picture. But Lo denied accusations that he leaked any plans.  A police spokesman said: “The case is under investigation while the officer concerned has been suspended from duty. So far, no one has been arrested.” Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos He added the force attached great importance to officers’ integrity and would handle the matter seriously if any misconduct was found. CORONAVIRUS UPDATE Get updates direct to your inbox SUBSCRIBE Another source said Lo worked for the Hospital Authority.  The city rang in the new year with muted celebrations that gave way to defiant anti-government protests late into Tuesday night, while police fired tear gas and deployed at least one water cannon to chase people off the streets.  While no fierce clashes were reported, Mong Kok, a busy shopping district, was the main flashpoint as radical protesters blocked roads, started fires, let off fireworks and disrupted traffic, prompting police to fire several rounds of tear gas. Into the early hours of New Year’s Day, protesters and riot police were locked in a stand-off on Nathan Road. Officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd, and a first-aid volunteer was hit. Police arrested 420 individuals between December 30 and January 1, with the youngest aged only 12. Critics accuse police of using excessive force against protesters but the force has dismissed such allegations. The Complaints Against Police Office has received more than 1,300 complaints but no officers have been punished. In November, a police officer who drove his motorcycle into protesters in Kwai Fong was suspended with immediate effect, the force said at first, adding that the case was very serious and would be investigated. Hours later, the force changed the wording and said the officer “was put on leave” instead. The officer resumed work later that month. The Auxiliary Police Force, which comprises volunteers, has 3,000 officers. Auxiliary officers support the regular 31,000-strong force on crowd management duties during major public events and in other pre-planned operations. They also provide staff for command and control centres and help protect key points such as consular premises. The uniform and equipment of the two branches are the same – including a .38 revolver, baton and pepper spray – and auxiliary officers receive full training on the use of the weapons during basic training. The only difference in the uniform is that auxiliary members have the letter “A” on both shoulder badges. 	SCMP

Ng Wai-man, 64, was given 15 months’ of probation by Eastern Court. He admitted he had attempted to damage the police van with a baggage trolley outside Hong Kong MTR station on the night of October 14 last year. The retiree initially faced one count of criminal damage. Prosecutors said that when protesters surrounded the vehicle while officers were apprehending a protester at 9pm, Ng hit the police van twice with the trolley, leaving a dent and a scratch. Prosecutors said police relied on television footage to support their allegation, but the defence countered that other online sources had revealed the defendant only hit the vehicle on its tyre and caused no visible damage. In the last hearing on December 13, prosecutors then said they would press on with a lesser charge of attempted criminal damage, upon seeking legal advice. Ng pleaded guilty to the charge.  On Friday, Magistrate Lam Tsz-kan accepted that the defendant had committed the lesser offence out of impulse and sentenced him to probation as suggested by the probation officer. Ng told the Post that after his first court appearance, he had found online footage showing he was not the one who caused the damage to the police van. He later obtained the original footage from a reporter, after raising a placard at a rally several days later in search of the individual behind the video. Post In the same courtroom, Ngan Wai-ho, 20, who is unemployed, saw his charge dropped after prosecutors admitted they had insufficient evidence to accuse him of possessing two spanners.  He was charged with one count of possessing an instrument fit for unlawful purpose, after he was arrested during a rally in Causeway Bay on November 2.  Also on Friday, 14 men aged 17 to 39 faced a range of allegations – from criminal damage, possessing prohibited items to assaulting a police officer – following their arrests during the protests on New Year’s Day. They included Sam Ka-lam, 37, a guest lecturer at Education University. He was apprehended after police officers intercepted him in Wan Chai and found a home-made crossbow, 20 sharpened wooden sticks and two wooden sticks in his possession. 	SCMP

The park said on Friday the freeze, starting from January, was a difficult budgetary decision to make. “But by forgoing staff raises, the park will avert lay-offs that might otherwise be necessary,” the Aberdeen resort said in a press statement. The last time the attraction froze all salaries was in 2003, when a deadly outbreak of Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) hit the city. In 2017, amid an economic downturn, most frontline staff still enjoyed a 1.5 to 2.6 per cent pay rise although management did not get an increment. The latest announcement followed the park last month reporting a widening deficit for the past financial year. The deficit more than doubled to HK$557.3 million (US$72 million) in its financial year to June 30, from HK$236.5 million the previous year – largely as a result of repairs from damage caused by Typhoon Mangkhut, which struck in summer 2018.  Wong Shuk-fan, chairwoman of the Ocean Park Employees’ Union, said the pay freeze was understandable given the huge deficit last year, but she believed the management had responsibilities as well. “Given the chief executive of Ocean Park announced plans to retire this July, and they are still [in the process of] hiring both a chief executive and personnel director, it seems we are running without proper management,” Wong said.  “We want someone with experience to head the company through difficult times.”  The ongoing civil unrest, which broke out in June over the now-withdrawn extradition bill, has also dimmed the 42-year-old park’s prospects. The park said on Friday that visitor numbers dropped more than 60 per cent year-on-year from July to December 2019 and that it expected market conditions would remain unpredictable with no quick rebound for the tourism sector in sight. To maintain operational and financial sustainability in an extremely difficult operating environment, the park has been implementing a number of cost control measures on the premise that visitor service, animal welfare, show quality, and the safety of guests and staff would not be affected. These measures include strict control of operating expenses and discretionary expenses, energy conservation, suspension of non-urgent and non-essential hires, voluntary no pay leave, voluntary early retirement and the latest, cancellation of salary review. However, to celebrate the Lunar New Year, all eligible full-time employees will receive a red packet of HK$600, whilst eligible part-time staff will receive a red packet with half that amount. The extradition bill protests evolved into a broader anti-government movement with escalating levels of violence between radical protesters and police affecting tourist, commercial and residential districts. The tourism sector has suffered setbacks, with visitor arrivals down 56 per cent in November year on year, to 2.65 million – the biggest drop since May 2003. More than 40 regions have issued warnings or alerts to travellers planning to visit Hong Kong. Set up in the 1970s, Ocean Park has been facing rising competition from theme parks across the border, namely Chimelong Ocean Kingdom in Hengqin, Zhuhai, which positions itself as a Monte Carlo of the East. Ocean Park’s new HK$2.9 billion water park, known as Tai Shue Wan Water World, is expected to open this year, while completion of a Fullerton hotel and resort at the park is due in 2021. Meanwhile, its rival, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort on Lantau Island, will give staff pay rises despite its losses. Eligible staff would get an increment ranging from about 1.5 per cent to 4 per cent, effective on January 1. Bonuses equivalent to 0.6 to 1.6 months of base salary would also be given. A Disneyland spokesman said the resort had taken a variety of factors into consideration with a view to “maintaining competitiveness in the labour market and high standard of service”. In November, the resort said the economic turmoil would cost it US$135 million in income by the end of the year. In 2018, Disneyland reported a deficit of HK$54 million compared with a loss of HK$345 million in 2017. 	SCMP

Many in the crowd on Friday wore masks as students, university lecturers, pro-democracy lawmakers also came to show support. They chanted slogans including “Say no to white terror” and “Educators, unite as one”. The move came as a war of words raged between the Professional Teachers’ Union, which represents about 85 per cent of teachers in the city, and the Education Bureau. Both sides have been trading barbs since December over the treatment of teachers in cases linked to the anti-government movement. A secondary schoolteacher, 50, who used a pseudonym of Sugar, said she felt “angry” about the vast number of teachers facing complaints and suspension in recent months, especially cases where teachers had only expressed their personal views on social media. Sugar, who has taught Chinese for more than 28 years, also said she felt “disappointed” at Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung and accused the bureau of “scapegoating” teachers and schools. Yeung told mainland Chinese news outlet Shanghai Observer last Saturday that the government had the power to disqualify principals who were deemed unsuitable for their jobs. Shanghai Observer  “A few years ago, I thought Yeung had a conscience, but [that] interview shows he has betrayed teachers,” Sugar said, adding that she believed the minister could no longer represent the majority of teachers’ voices. “As a member of the education sector, we should stand up and speak out.”  Another secondary schoolteacher surnamed Yuen, in his 40s, who has taught science for more than 20 years, said he believed the Education Bureau was “threatening principals” when it said they could be removed from their positions if they did not cooperate with investigations on teachers.  “When there were previous cases of principals abusing their power, the [bureau] had not said they would use their powers to suspend the principals. But now when there were no such cases of principals not cooperating with the bureau’s investigation, the bureau has mentioned that power,” he said.  “The government has been trying to suppress their voices. Teachers should be able to freely express themselves when they are not at work – including going to protests or making comments on social media – as they are also human and are entitled to freedom of speech,” she said. Hong Kong has been rocked by protests for more than seven months. Sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill which would have allowed for the transfer of suspects to mainland China for trial, the campaign has since morphed into a wider call for an investigation into police conduct and universal suffrage, among other demands. So far, 80 teachers and teaching assistants have been arrested in connection with the protests, and the bureau has received 123 protest-related complaints against educators, with wrongdoing confirmed in 13 cases. Some of the complaints centred on online comments made by teachers. The union accused the bureau of not giving teachers a chance to defend themselves against the charges before being notified that their cases had been substantiated. Union president Fung Wai-wah previously said the bureau was “spreading white terror” and the government was blaming teachers for encouraging students to take to the streets. The bureau hit back in a written statement on Thursday night, accusing the union of a loss of professionalism. “The bureau has repeatedly explained the complaints process, but the union continues to twist facts and spread worry among teachers. It seems to be the one that is actually inciting white terror,” the statement read. On Friday morning, Yeung said the bureau had found the response from principals “very positive” so far in terms of fulfilling their duties to investigate complaints. “At present we have not been carrying out any investigations against principals on this particular matter,” he said. The organiser estimated about 20,000 participated in the rally. Police put the number at about 2,500. A police spokesman said officers seized about a dozen petrol bombs in large plant pots at Chater Garden in Central after a tip-off at around 4pm on Friday. A source said a total of 18 bottles of petrol bombs were found and did not rule out that they could be linked to the evening’s mass assembly.

For the first 11 months, the decline was 10.3 per cent against the same period last year. Retail sales continued to fall sharply in November as protests turned extremely violent, causing severe disruptions to tourism and consumption-related activities and further dampening consumption sentiment, a government spokesman said. “The near-term outlook for the retail trade continues to hinge on how local social incidents will evolve. As such, ending violence and restoring social order are essential to the recovery of the retail trade and indeed that of the whole economy,” he said. The hardest-hit goods were luxury items such as jewellery, watches and valuable gifts, which recorded a staggering 43.5 per cent drop in sales value, followed by medicines and cosmetics with a 33.4 per cent fall. Sales of commodities in department stores also tumbled almost 33 per cent.

Annie Tse Yau On-yee, chairwoman of the 9,000-member Hong Kong Retail Management Association, warned of a wave of shutdowns in the sector.  An association survey last month of 170 members indicated a rising trend of shop closures, she said. “I believe the retail sector will continue to face a difficult time in the first half of this year as I still can’t envisage that the social unrest will be resolved any time soon,” Tse said. “The outlook for retail sales very much depends on the repercussions of the social turmoil, which has severely dampened consumer sentiment.” However, she noted the survey showed a slight improvement in consumer spending in December. “According to members, as the social unrest started to calm down in December with the festive season kicking in, retail sales got a bit better last month and would continue to January,” she said. “However, even if the unrest has died down, it will take at least three to six months for the city to restore consumer and tourist confidence. “Therefore, we think retail sales will continue to drop year on year in the first half of this year.” 	SCMP

On Friday morning, the bronze statues were covered with hoardings after they were sprayed with red paint and briefly set alight with stickers after anti-government protesters vented their destructive fury against the banking giant. An HSBC spokeswoman said initial cleaning was being carried out on the damaged lions while conservation experts from Britain would be invited to advise on the restoration. “We are saddened by the attempts to vandalise the lions. Our first priority is always the safety of customers and employees,” she said. “The whole restoration process will take a period of time so now they are covered with whiteboards for protection. We are committed to doing everything we can to conserve the bronze lions, which form part of the bank’s and Hong Kong’s history.” The two lions have only been removed from public view twice before, when they were seized by the Japanese during the second world war, and in the 1980s when the bank’s new headquarters were being built.  Recently, HSBC has drawn the ire of some protesters who blame the bank for the closure of a fundraising account for protesters held by a group called Spark Alliance. In December, police froze more than HK$70 million (US$9 million) in the account and four Spark Alliance members were arrested in connection with money laundering. The bank first adopted the sculpted lions as its icons in 1921 when Alexander Stephen, the then chief manager, decided a pair of lions symbolising protection and security would look impressive outside the new Shanghai branch, which was being built at the time.  He wrote that the inspiration for his decision came from the imposing lions outside the Venetian Arsenal. The Shanghai lions were cast in bronze in England from models prepared by Henry Poole, and were shipped out to China for the opening of the new building in 1923. They were named “Stephen” and “Stitt” after Stephen and Gordon Stitt, the then Shanghai manager, with Stephen depicted roaring, and Stitt in a dormant pose.  Later, when HSBC decided to build its Hong Kong headquarters in Central, it commissioned another two bronze lions from Shanghai-based British sculptor WW Wagstaff, who cast them in Shanghai. Both lions were in place for the opening of the new headquarters in October 1935. They have guarded the bank entrance in Central ever since, except for two notable periods of absence – during the second world war, and in the 1980s for the construction of the current HSBC building. During the second world war, Hong Kong was invaded and occupied by the Japanese army. The statues were among a series of bronze items taken by the Japanese to be melted down for munitions, but they survived because the war ended before this could happen. They were recognised by an American sailor in Osaka in 1945 and a year later were returned to Hong Kong. One of them still bears bullet marks from the fighting in Hong Kong when the Japanese invaded. 	SCMP

But they said investigators could not confirm it was the shot that left Indonesian Veby Mega Indah blind, making it difficult to respond to her demand they identify the officer so she can take further legal action. There is a six-month time limit for private prosecutions in Hong Kong, meaning Veby must bring her case against the officer before the end of March. The journalist of 13 years is also contemplating a civil claim against the officer. Senior government counsel Vienne Luk Wai-nga, for the police, told the High Court on Friday the active investigation “was still ongoing”. Indonesian journalist injured by Hong Kong police projectile calls for ‘justice’ Indonesian journalist injured by Hong Kong police projectile calls for ‘justice’ Veby, the associate editor of Suara Hong Kong News, had applied to the court for an order forcing the Commissioner of Police to disclose the documents showing the identity and unique identification number of the officer in question. The 39-year-old is believed to have been hit by a rubber bullet when she was covering a protest in Wan Chai on September 29, while she stood with other journalists and wearing clothing that identified her as a member of the press.  The shooting caused her to permanently lose her sight in her right eye, as the force of impact ruptured the pupil and doctors could not save her vision. Her lawyers have identified the shooter as the police officer standing on the staircase leading from Gloucester Road to the footbridge connecting the Immigration Tower and Wan Chai MTR Station Exit A2, at 4.50pm on September 29.

But Luk said there was difficulty in identifying the officer because of how Veby’s application was worded, which targeted the individual, “who shot the plaintiff using a firearm that caused the plaintiff injury”.   The court heard officers are about to arrange a formal interview with Veby to clarify the circumstances of her injury. Still, Luk noted the issue of causation should not be determined in these preliminary proceedings for disclosure. Mr Justice Russell Coleman advised parties to look at the wording, but Veby’s counsel Tim Parker revealed his team had been told police would still object to revealing the officer’s name, even if the wording was changed. Full arguments will be heard on February 17. Outside court, Veby said she was happy the judge would hear her case again next month, as the six-month time limit to mount her intended private prosecution would expire by the end of March. “I’m very happy today, very glad that the judge understand the urgency of my case and set an earliest time [on] February 17,” she said. “I hope justice will prevail in Hong Kong for Hong Kong’s sake.” 	SCMP

Hong Kong government In a strongly worded statement released a day after the Union for New Civil Servants condemned police for cutting short a mass protest on New Year’s Day, the government warned the union about violating civil servants’ guidelines on impartiality, and accused it of ignoring public safety considerations. police for cutting short a mass protest “The government stressed that civil servants should not unscrupulously criticise the policies of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government or enforcement operations by individual departments,” the statement said.

On Wednesday, organisers claimed the turnout surpassed the 1.03 million estimate for the first major rally against the extradition bill on June 9 but the officially approved protest was forced to end at 6.15pm, three hours after it started. It’s hard not to give an impression that the government is favouring the police force Union for New Civil Servants statement Police, who put the figure at about 60,000, blamed radicals who vandalised banks and blocked roads for the decision.  In its latest comments, the union cited the JPOA’s letter to Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung in July, which offered the “strongest condemnation” for the minister’s apology over the force’s handling of the violent attacks at Yuen Long MTR station on July 21.  “Faced with police remarks criticising the government and their superiors, the government has not said the police can’t criticise government policies, but the chief secretary instead said he would meet the relevant union members and clarify his remarks,” the union said. “Government’s treatment of the police and this union who both belong to the civil service is so vastly different, it’s hard not to give an impression that the government is favouring the police force,” it read.

The civil servants’ group went on to say it had a responsibility to restore Hongkongers’ trust in the civil service, after controversial police actions during anti-government protests. In a rare move, the government issued a second statement on the matter on Friday night, reiterating much of what the first one said, but adding: “The government calls on all civil servants to stay united in this difficult time, and continue to support the government’s work to stamp out violence as a matter of top priority.” Established in November, the group is one of a number of new unions, notably in the financial, IT and medical sectors, formed recently to fight for better labour rights as well as to plan and organise citywide pro-democracy strikes. It now boasts 2,100 members from the about 176,000-strong civil service. Hong Kong has been embroiled in seven months of mass protests triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill.

The bureau’s statement follows a brewing row over its handling of complaints against teachers involved in anti-government protests, which has seen 80 teachers and teaching assistants arrested. It had also received 123 protest-related complaints against educators, with wrongdoings confirmed in 13 cases. anti-government protests On Friday evening, the pro-democracy Professional Teachers’ Union is expected to hold a rally in Edinburgh Place over what it calls “white terror” imposed by the government. The union earlier accused education minister Kevin Yeung Yun-hung of trying to gag dissident views in schools by warning even headmasters could be dismissed if they could not handle “problem teachers” properly, referring to remarks made by Yeung in an interview with a Communist Party news website. interview with a Communist Party news website “The Professional Teachers Union’s continuous twisting of the education minister’s words makes people wonder if they are trying to incite teachers’ emotions and promote their rally, as well as its political agenda,” the bureau’s spokesman said. “The bureau has repeatedly explained the complaints process, but the union continues to twist facts and spread worry among teachers. It seems to be the one that is actually inciting white terror.” The bureau accused the union, which represents about 85 per cent of teachers in the city, of a loss of professionalism, and said the government had a responsibility to follow up with every case of a teacher being charged, arrested or having complaints made against them to ensure the welfare of students, and maintain the standard of the education sector.  Teachers had every opportunity to appeal against any complaints made to the school authorities, the bureau said, and it would review reports made by the schools and strike down any unfounded complaints. If wrongdoing was confirmed, the teachers would also be given the chance to submit a written explanation, the statement said, adding the process was fair.  “It is flatly spreading white terror,” said Fung Wai-wah, the union president. “The education sector is being scapegoated. The present crisis Hong Kong is facing is due to the government’s refusal to listen to the people’s views.   Fung also said the union was planning to launch a crowdfunding campaign to raise money to help teachers facing suspension over their involvement in protests. Friday’s rally is expected to last for two hours, starting from 7pm. A turnout of at least 5,000 is expected. Fung said representatives from overseas teachers’ unions would also attend to show support to their counterparts in Hong Kong. 	SCMP

The New Year’s Day incident occurred on Kin Wing Street near the junction with Kin Tai Street in Tuen Mun soon after 6pm, when the victim, 63, was stopped by the pair.   “The two men impersonated officers and demanded to check the victim’s identity card,” a police spokesman said. “At this juncture, they snatched a paper bag containing HK$210,000 from the man and fled on foot.” The victim gave chase, but called police after he lost track of the suspects.  Officers combed the area but no arrests were made on Wednesday. Police described the two robbers as each being about 1.7 metres in height and in their 30s. One of them had on a green jacket and blue pants, while the other was clad in black at the time of the incident. On Monday, a 40-year-old man was robbed of a bag containing HK$500,000 at knifepoint on Ashley Road in the popular shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui at about 7.30pm. Three masked robbers fled before police arrived. The man suffered minor hand injuries but he did not require hospital treatment.  There has been a significant rise in reports of robbery and snatch theft across Hong Kong in the second half of 2019, with the force blaming the ongoing anti-government protests for exhausting police resources.  Police handled 170 reports of robbery from January to November 2019, up nearly 28 per cent from 133 in the same period the previous year. Reports of snatch thefts surged 44 per cent to 163 in the same span last year, from 113 cases during this period in 2018.

Patrols are now conducted in police vans instead. The annual winter anti-crime operation, carried out between the Christmas and New Year’s Day holidays, was also cancelled because of police diverting resources to handling protests. Hong Kong has been gripped by nearly seven months of anti-government demonstrations – sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill – that have often descended into chaos and violent clashes between protesters and police. Chief Superintendent Kenneth Kwok Ka-chuen of the force’s public relations branch said last week that police recorded the lowest crime rate in 44 years in 2018, but the violence of rioters had pushed the city’s rule of law to the brink of total collapse.

But the force denied the accusation and said that no one – including journalists, first-aiders and observers – had the right to stay in a “riot”. More than a third of those intercepted by police in Causeway Bay on Wednesday were released. Civil Rights Observer on Thursday confirmed three of its volunteers were arrested the night before and said that the move violated the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information, which stated monitors should not be denied access to areas when they believed a violation of human rights was being committed. “It is the first time any of our observers have been arrested since the team was set up in 2018,” the group said. “We strongly condemn police for these indiscriminate arrests.” Tam Man-kei, director of Amnesty International Hong Kong, also said the targeting of independent monitors was “especially disturbing” as they were essential to ensure full accountability. On Wednesday, a march organised by the Civil Human Rights Front was cut short three hours after it started, with police citing violence in a branch of HSBC.  The violence then escalated as radical protesters spilled out into Causeway Bay, Wan Chai and Central, where they vandalised more bank branches, set fires and barricaded roads. Later, police made mass arrests outside Sogo department store, where at one point around 70 people were seen being made to squat on the ground as they were searched and processed.  Some complained they had done nothing wrong, but were trapped after police cordoned off a sizeable area. Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos A total of 464 people were intercepted in Causeway Bay, of whom 287 were arrested for unlawful assembly, according to the police. The other 177 were released.  A 12-year-old primary school student and an 81-year-old citizen were among the 420 people arrested on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. Eric Lai Yan-ho, deputy convenor of the front, said it was unreasonable to detain people without sufficient evidence then release them hours later. “They were forced to kneel on the streets. It is unacceptable.” Chief Superintendent Kwok Ka-chuen on Thursday said they had given repeated warnings for everyone to leave the scene. “No one has the privilege to stay in a riot,” Kwok said. “You can claim to be a first-aider [or] a human rights observer. But this does not exempt you from the legal liability of taking part in a riot.” Ng Lok-chun, senior superintendent of Hong Kong Island, denied police had made arbitrary mass arrests. “When we had our first dispersal operation yesterday, rallygoers left. Those who came out again deliberately blocked roads,” Ng said. Police had set up a cordon as they could not be sure whether the arrestees posed a risk to others and also to prevent any attempts to snatch arrested people away, Ng added. Lai also attacked the force for its “unprecedented and disproportionate” decision to cut short the march, setting an “impossible” time frame of 45 minutes for the huge crowd to leave. He said it had risked a stampede. “Many people didn’t know how to leave safely and didn’t take the trains for fear of arrest even though they only marched peacefully.” Organisers were told at 5.30pm to call off the march, but were initially given 30 minutes – then an additional 15 minutes – to disperse the crowd. “It was the first time a march of the scale of 1 million people was cut short,” Lai said. “With only 100-odd helpers and many people still stuck in Victoria Park, it was impossible to disband a procession like this.” Mass arrests and violence: no end in sight for Hong Kong protests in 2020 2 Jan 2020 Mass arrests and violence: no end in sight for Hong Kong protests in 2020 2 Jan 2020 The group estimated more than 1.03 million people took part in the march, while police put the turnout at 47,000 in the procession and another 13,000 at the park. Ng stressed police had only started advancing on Arsenal Street at 6.30pm and fired tear gas at around 7pm, which was 90 minutes after the ending time of the march. But police had fired the first round of tear gas at protesters at around 5pm, shortly after the HSBC branch on Hennessy Road was vandalised. In response to an incident during which a police officer forcibly removed the protective goggles of lawmaker Ted Hui Chi-fung and pepper-sprayed him in Causeway Bay on Wednesday night, Senior Superintendent Kelvin Kong Wing-cheung said that Hui had ignored repeated orders to get back on the pavement. “He refused to cooperate and resisted. My colleagues issued warnings that pepper spray might be used. I don’t know if it was because he was wearing goggles, he was not afraid,” Kong said. “So my colleagues removed his goggles and used pepper spray to make the dispersal effective.” Hui on Thursday vowed to launch legal action.

Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos Many were dressed in office clothes, with some wearing face masks. They yelled slogans over what they saw as a violation of their right to assemble. In recent months, protesters have been taking to the heart of Hong Kong’s business district at lunchtime so office workers can join the demonstrations. “Join work unions. Strikes on three aspects for everyone,” the crowd chanted, referring to civil disobedience action for schools, businesses and stock markets as part of the movement.  Some held placards accusing police of terminating the march and arresting innocent citizens without reason. An IT engineer, who only went by the name Li, said he had attended most of the lunchtime rallies, but there was particular meaning to do so on Thursday.  “The main reason I came here today is that police forcefully terminated our rally yesterday,” the 28-year-old said.  He accused police of abruptly stopping the rally because the turnout was high, and the government did not want the world to see there was still a lot of support for the pro-democracy movement. Li said he was optimistic about 2020, and believed authorities would have to give in sooner or later, as concepts such as spending exclusively at yellow shops – businesses which support the protesters’ cause – would help the movement thrive. Mass arrests and violence: no end in sight for Hong Kong protests in 2020 2 Jan 2020 Mass arrests and violence: no end in sight for Hong Kong protests in 2020 2 Jan 2020 Johnny Chow said he took part in Wednesday’s rally, but was forced to leave soon after he set off from the starting point at Victoria Park.

New Year’s Eve protests in Hong Kong New Year’s Eve protests in Hong Kong “I can make myself heard by taking part in all these little gatherings,” he said. On Wednesday, the Civil Human Rights Front, the group responsible for some of the city’s largest marches, organised a New Year’s Day march from Causeway Bay to Central, as anti-government protests enter their seventh month. The group said more than 1 million people took part in Wednesday’s rally to press for five demands triggered by the government’s proposed extradition bill, which was withdrawn in September. But police, who claim the peak turnout was 47,560, stopped the march at 5.30pm, little more than 2½ hours after it started, citing the vandalism of banks and shops by radicals. Two historic lion statues outside HSBC’s headquarters in Central were set on fire, with several other branches trashed. The bank became unpopular earlier this month after it was accused by protesters of playing a role in a recent police crackdown on Spark Alliance, a major fundraising platform for protesters. became unpopular earlier this month after it was accused by protesters of playing a role in a recent police crackdown on Spark Alliance On Thursday morning the eyes of both lion statues were still covered in red paint despite the efforts of cleaners. Other parts of the statues appeared blackened from the arson attack. A construction worker, surnamed Tsang, 50, said he was against the act of damaging the statues, as well as with any other form of vandalism. “Generally speaking, any destruction of property, be they lamp posts or traffic lights, is wrong,” he said. “Protesters can fight for their demands, but they should not be destroying things.” An accountant, surnamed Au, said however that if protesters did indeed vandalise the statues, it was a “symbolic act” against the banking giant as the lions had long been its icons. A spokesman from HSBC said the bank was “extremely saddened” by the unreasonable damage to the statues, but preliminary cleaning work was under way. He said it would be followed by further assessment and restoration work by experts, which was expected to take some time. “The bronze lion sculptures share a close tie with HSBC and the history of Hong Kong. We would do our utmost to protest these important antiques,” he said. 	SCMP

Hong Kong The claim was made in an essay by Zhang Xiaoming, Beijing’s top official in charge of Hong Kong and Macau affairs, that was published in the latest issue of  Qiushi (Seeking Truth), a bimonthly journal produced by the Chinese Communist Party.   Qiushi Qiushi The article came after Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Macau last month to mark the 20th anniversary of the enclave’s return to Chinese rule. Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Macau Zhang quoted Xi, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party, as saying that China was firm in safeguarding “national sovereignty, security and people’s interests” and would never tolerate foreign interference in Hong Kong or Macau. “These comments by general secretary Xi Jinping were a head-on blow to them and meant to serve as an encouragement to us in our rightful struggle and counteractions when external forces are deeply involved in the extradition bill’s turmoil, taking part in and manufacturing the chaos in Hong Kong, and they are also trying to infiltrate Macau,” he said.  Zhang said Hong Kong had suffered “setbacks” but Macau had made great strides in implementing the “one country, two systems” governance model. He said the two cities were different but what Xi said in Macau should serve as “important guidance” for Hong Kong. For months, Beijing has blamed foreign powers for instigating the unrest in Hong Kong, which began in June with a mass rally to oppose a now scrapped extradition bill. It has simultaneously praised Macau for maintaining social stability and economic prosperity, but never suggested that foreign forces were targeting Macau. extradition bill A foreign ministry spokesperson said earlier that the unrest in Hong Kong was “the work of the US”, citing comments from politicians in Washington who have expressed sympathy for the pro-democracy movement in the city.  After the US Congress passed a bill that increased Washington’s scrutiny of Hong Kong, Beijing retaliated by suspending visits of US military vessels to the city and sanctioning several US-based non-government organisations. suspending visits of US military vessels More than 1 million join Hong Kong New Year's Day march, organisers say 3 Jan 2020 More than 1 million join Hong Kong New Year's Day march, organisers say 3 Jan 2020 Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, a semi-official think tank, said Beijing’s concerns about Macau were likely related to those organisations.  “Beijing has long had national security concerns about Macau and much of that concern has involved the US,” he said. “But foreign organisations have had problems establishing a presence in Macau so Beijing believes they are more likely [to build their] influence through [their presence] in Hong Kong.” Lau said that although Beijing wanted Macau to diversify its economy and open up to foreign investment, it would also keep its guard up against foreign influence. “Beijing might think that it has less to fear for Macau as it is not as developed [as Hong Kong], but its concerns will rise when it seeks to push Macau to become more international,” he said.

After ending the last day of 2019 with protest chaos, the city set the tone on New Year’s Day for another year fraught with civil unrest as masked radicals rampaged on the streets of Hong Kong Island long after the organisers were forced to call off the march early by police. fraught with civil unrest The police-approved march to the Central business district began just before 3pm, with the bulk of protesters flocking to the starting point at Victoria Park in the shopping hub of Causeway Bay, while others joined them along the way. Protest organiser the Civil Human Rights Front claimed the turnout had surpassed the 1.03 million estimate for the first major rally against the extradition bill in June. Police put the figure at 47,000 during the march while another 13,000 were still at the starting point. Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos Hong Kong New Year’s Day march cut short, descends into chaos It was a show of solidarity to push for the protesters’ core demands, including an independent investigation into police conduct over nearly seven months of social unrest, amnesty for all those arrested, and universal suffrage. The city’s embattled leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, has rejected all their demands, except for withdrawing her despised extradition bill which first sparked the protests nearly seven months ago. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor  “I think the protests will continue as the chief executive is not responding in any sense, and from her so-called video to celebrate the new year we don’t see her showing any regret for what she did,” a 16-year-old student at Victoria Park said. An art gallery employee at the protest said: “As time goes by, people might start to feel numb, therefore we should remain sensitive.” The trouble started about two hours into the march at 4.30pm, when radicals vandalised an HSBC branch on Hennessy Road in Wan Chai. The protest movement has turned against the banking giant, which it accuses of having a hand in a recent police crackdown on Spark Alliance, a major fundraising platform for protesters. A police squad, including masked undercover officers, arrived at the scene and arrested five people, one of whom was dragged face-down on the ground, angering other protesters. Officers used pepper spray and fired pepper balls at them, and resorted to tear gas to disperse a crowd that began hurling umbrellas and other projectiles at them. Petrol bombs were also thrown at them.  Just after 5.30pm, the organisers announced they had been ordered by police to end the march because of the violence. Thousands of protesters were still waiting to set off from Victoria Park at the time. “On the first day of 2020, police dismissed the first licensed assembly of the year with an absurd excuse. The Hong Kong government has shown its unwillingness to listen to the voices of the masses, infringing the right of assembly of Hong Kong citizens,” the front complained in a statement.  With the march suddenly over, many became defiant and refused to leave the streets, spilling out into Causeway Bay, Wan Chai and Central. The violence escalated as night fell. At least five HSBC outlets were smashed up or firebombed, prompting the banking giant to issue a statement saying: “We strongly condemn the acts of vandalism and damage directed at our premises repeatedly in the last few days. We believe these are unjustified.” Radicals also hurled petrol bombs at a Starbucks outlet in Tin Hau, directing their anger at the franchise, which is owned by the Maxim’s catering group. The daughter of Maxim’s founder has run afoul of the movement after criticising the violence. criticising the violence Bricks were dug up and fires set to block roads, causing traffic chaos, while graffiti was painted on the outer wall of the High Court, insulting judge Anthea Pang Po-kam, who sent three localists to prison over the 2016 Mong Kok riot.

Law Society president Melissa Kaye Pang expressed shock over the attack. By 7pm, police had fired multiple rounds of tear gas in Central, Wan Chai and Causeway Bay, and deployed water cannons to chase protesters off the streets. Causeway Bay became a flashpoint, and police made mass arrests outside the Sogo department store, where around 70 people were made to squat on the ground as they were searched and processed. Some complained they had not done anything wrong, but were trapped after police cordoned off a sizeable area they happened to be within. Officers also raised a flag at journalists at the scene, warning them they were taking part in an illegal assembly.

Basically, I was cornered at a shopping mall,” Hui said. “Then they removed my mask and sprayed at me without warning.” Police said at least 400 people were arrested on Wednesday mostly for illegal assembly and possession of offensive weapons, making it one of the biggest mass arrests in a single day. Sources said police had changed their strategy from usually dispersing crowds to making mass arrests. The police operation continued late into the night as officers took control of one occupied area after another. They also set up roadblocks along major routes and were seen checking buses. The New Year’s Day march was led by newly elected district councillors from the opposition camp, who also raised funds for Spark Alliance, filling at least six donation boxes with HK$100 and HK$500 (US$13 and US$64) notes. Newly established trade unions also set up booths along the route, urging demonstrators to join up and help the movement with possible strike action. 	SCMP

The Education Bureau revealed earlier that about 80 teachers and teaching assistants had been arrested over the ongoing protests, while it had received 123 protest-related complaints against educators, with wrongdoings confirmed in 13 cases. But the bureau has been criticised for treating the complaints unfairly, and education minister Kevin Yeung Yun-hung was accused of imposing “white terror” by warning to disqualify headmasters who failed to handle the complaints properly during an interview with a mainland media last week. Education sector lawmaker Ip Kin-yuen wrote to the bureau this week, urging it to stop punishing teachers based on assertions made in anonymous complaints. He added the authority had done “grave procedural injustice” by concluding that teachers had breached their duties without making any direct inquiries. Arrested teacher suspended following appeal from government 12 Dec 2019 Arrested teacher suspended following appeal from government 12 Dec 2019 Ip also urged the authority to withhold only half the salaries of the interdicted teachers instead of suspending their salaries in full.  But the bureau stressed it needed to take proper action to ensure students’ interests and defend the image of the profession. “If the schools take no action, allowing teachers involved in serious misconduct or moral issues to continue to stay in touch with students, how will their parents rest assured?” the bureau said in a statement.  It said the teachers under inquiry would be given more than one opportunity to respond to the accusations they faced, rejecting Ip’s claim that some teachers had been considered guilty of misconduct without being given a chance to defend themselves. The bureau also said it was duty-bound to follow up even anonymous complaints if the accusations involved speeches or acts that breached moral standards or that could be perceived to endanger the safety and healthy development of students. Teachers come under attack as more students join Hong Kong protests 14 Oct 2019 Teachers come under attack as more students join Hong Kong protests 14 Oct 2019 “Any move to ignore or downplay a teacher’s misconduct or illegal speech will only damage the image of their profession,” it said.  The authority also said stopping payments in full to teachers involved in criminal court proceedings or allegations of serious misconduct was in line with the bureau’s management codes and the Employment Ordinance. Yeung last week warned during an interview with online news outlet Shanghai Observer, operated by Communist Party newspaper Jiefang Daily, that school principals might be axed if the bureau found them not handling complaints against teachers properly. Jiefang Daily Under the Education Ordinance, the bureau’s permanent secretary may withdraw a principal’s appointment approval for failure to perform duties satisfactorily, or for being unacceptable to most of the school’s managers. The ongoing protests, which were triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill in June last year, have over the months morphed into a wider anti-government movement demanding greater democracy and accountability of police.

Participants do not have to worry about failing to check their numbers,” she said.  In its earlier statement, the board said its system had successfully assigned a number to each of the 1.63 million participants who signed up on Tuesday night. Tourism sector lawmaker Yiu Si-wing urged the board to learn from the mistake and to continue to host big lucky draws with more expensive prizes for coming festivals such as the Lunar New Year. “The lucky draw idea is good for spicing up the festive atmosphere particularly when the city has been gripped by months of political turmoil,” he said. “The overwhelming response of participants shows the draw has attracted a lot of people. It’s a pity the technical problems disappointed many people.” Yiu said the fiasco showed the system’s capabilities had not been sufficiently tested and urged the board to make it up to the public. “The board should ensure its system is reliable and free of errors. It should conduct more lucky draws with more attractive prizes as compensation to the public for this bad experience,” he said.

He said the board should have simplified procedures including skipping the issuance of verification codes. “The website issued a huge amount of emails in a short time. It would easily be mistaken as sending out spam emails so it was blacklisted by many providers such as Google,” he said. “The lucky draw was supposed to lift the festive mood of people. But the fallout shows the Tourism Board’s inexperience in running the system, which left many people frustrated. It should have simplified the lucky draw procedures to make it enjoyable to the public.” Open to locals and tourists alike, the draw featuring more than HK$4 million (US$513,000) in prizes was arranged after the city’s traditional fireworks display was cancelled because of safety fears prompted by the months-long social unrest. The first prize is round-trip plane tickets for four from Cathay Pacific, available to 10 lucky winners. Other prizes include supermarket vouchers, iPhones, luxury hotel and spa stays and tickets to Hong Kong Disneyland and Ocean Park. 	SCMP

Revealing details on anti-government protest violence which had spilled over from the previous night, during which the MTR Corporation’s facilities were once again targeted by radicals, the operator said five people had entered a light rail vehicle and set fire to it at 2am on Wednesday. anti-government protest The incident occurred on a Tuen Mun Pier-bound train at Light Rail Depot station, where the suspects entered the first carriage as it stopped to let off and pick up commuters. New Year’s Eve protests in Hong Kong New Year’s Eve protests in Hong Kong “Passengers on board quickly got off the train and no one was injured. The train captain immediately reported the incident to the operations control centre and used fire extinguishers to put out the fire. The train was then sent for inspection,” an MTR spokesman said. Separately, at about the same time, staff at a depot in Tuen Mun observed on surveillance footage some people hurling petrol bombs from outside into its compound. A double-decker bus at the depot, which is for both light rail trains and buses, was hit and caught fire.  “The staff members immediately went to put out the fire and no one was injured,” the spokesman said. The incidents happened after muted celebrations gave way to defiant anti-government protests late into Tuesday night, while the city, still rocked by the months-long civil unrest, rang in the new year. Police fired tear gas and deployed at least one water cannon to disperse crowds. muted celebrations gave way to defiant anti-government protests While no fierce clashes were reported, the shopping district of Mong Kok was the main flashpoint as radical protesters blocked roads, started fires, let off fireworks and disrupted traffic, prompting police action.

There were no injuries in the case.  The spokesman said: “The company strongly condemns the rioters’ acts, which have seriously endangered the safety of passengers and staff. We’ve reported the incidents to police.” The rail operator has come under vandalism by radical protesters since August after it was accused of bowing to pressure from Beijing and colluding with police over closures of stations near protests.  When the government announced a ban on masks on October 5, rampaging mobs attacked MTR stations, causing extensive damage and the entire rail network to shut down for the first time in its 40-year history. rampaging mobs Hong Kong protests leave MTR beaten, bruised and bleeding 28 Dec 2019 Hong Kong protests leave MTR beaten, bruised and bleeding 28 Dec 2019 Through most of October and November, the MTR Corp closed stations early for repairs, although critics accused it of imposing a “de facto curfew” on society. As of November 24, radicals had caused extensive damage to 85 out of 94 MTR stations, and 62 of 68 light rail stops. Turnstiles, ticketing machines, surveillance cameras, lifts, escalators and rolling shutters were damaged. Some 54 heavy railway trains and 16 light rail vehicles were also hit. 	SCMP

Skylar, who weighed 3.3kg at birth, became the first baby delivered in the city on New Year’s Day as the clock struck midnight at Baptist Hospital. Her arrival was followed just five seconds later by a baby boy also born in the same hospital. Two other girls were delivered at Kwong Wah Hospital and Queen Elizabeth Hospital respectively within half an hour after midnight. Sharing her joy with the press, Yung admitted her first pregnancy came with mixed feelings amid the polarising climate in Hong Kong, gripped by months-long protests and civil unrest. months-long protests and civil unrest “Even when I was three months’ pregnant, I did not dare share the news with friends because many things had happened to Hong Kong. My emotions fluctuated as I watched the news,” she said.  “In the new year, I hope everyone can be happy, and fewer unfortunate incidents will take place. May everyone’s wish come true,” she added. Skylar is born into a musical family – Wong and Yung, aged 45 and 37 respectively, are both musicians who have collaborated with top local singers such as Joey Yung Cho-yee and Eason Chan Yick-shun.  “When I was five months’ pregnant, I helped organise Joey Yung’s concerts … Our baby has attended the show 19 times,” mother Janet Yung said with a laugh.  Yung said her daughter’s Chinese name – Hoi Ling – represented a wish she and her husband had for their child. According to her, Hoi, which means “sea”, and Ling, which represents music, are two things both parents adore most. Hoi Ling “We put all our favourite things together [in her name], and we hope she can freely sing the songs she likes in future,” Yung added. “Even though we have witnessed many unhappy and unexpected incidents in the city, I am very happy that she was born in Hong Kong.” Over at Kwong Wah Hospital in Mong Kok, a baby girl weighing 2.75kg became the third newborn for the new year, her cries announcing her arrival to the world at 12.15am. Five minutes later, another baby girl who weighed 2.76kg was born at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Yau Ma Tei. Her parents, both government employees, said they hoped the social unrest would be resolved peacefully and that their child could grow up happily. The UN estimated some 392,000 children worldwide were born on New Year’s Day. China was earlier projected to rank second with 46,299 newborns on this day, behind India’s record-breaking 67,385, according to Unicef. 	SCMP

The meeting was seen as an indication of the top Chinese leaders’ mounting concerns. US House passes Uygur law demanding sanctions on China over human rights abuses in Xinjiang US House passes Uygur law demanding sanctions on China over human rights abuses in Xinjiang Many of Xi’s warnings proved accurate, some even worse than he had predicted. He warned the officials the year would be full of “black swans”, or surprising events, and “grey rhinos” – highly probable yet neglected threats. As trade tensions with Washington exploded in 2019, Beijing tiptoed through the year with a strategy aimed at containing the impacts and retaliating against salvoes from the United States, along with a narrative intended to reassure its domestic audience despite a proliferation of tweets and leaks from the White House. In June, millions in Hong Kong took to the streets, first to protest against a controversial bill that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China, and then increasingly over myriad grievances with Hong Kong’s government and police force. There were regular confrontations involving anti-government protesters, police and pro-Beijing supporters in the second half of the year, as the city was engulfed by its worst political crisis in decades. millions in Hong Kong took to the streets, first to protest against a controversial bill that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China  Meanwhile, China sparked a huge backlash around the world for its internment and extensive surveillance of mostly Muslim ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang, in the country’s far west.

The epidemic was so damaging that rebuilding pork production was made one of the policy priorities during a top economic meeting in December attended by Xi. Beijing tried to manage its slowest economic growth in three decades The year was seen by some analysts as a challenging one for Xi, who had assumed the presidency in 2013. Some suggested that the new year might be no easier for him. Beijing had set 2020 as its target year for a number of key projects. It was the deadline for the Communist Party to achieve what it called a “comprehensive moderately prosperous society”, with a range of specific targets to reach in poverty eradication, economic growth and urban housing.  It is also the final year in which the party can prepare for a grand celebration of its 100th anniversary in 2021.  The analysts interviewed felt that there was little sign of the problems that had plagued China in the preceding year going away in 2020. Xinjiang, Hong Kong … now US turns human rights attention to Tibet 20 Dec 2019 Xinjiang, Hong Kong … now US turns human rights attention to Tibet 20 Dec 2019 For example, they expected China-US relations to remain rocky in the coming year even after the agreement of an interim trade deal between Beijing and Washington. “The US-China relationship is more like a constant than a variable now, and the tensions will remain in the next year,” said Shi Yinhong, an international affairs expert with Renmin University and an adviser to the State Council, China’s cabinet. “There’s no de-escalation of tensions in sight, except maybe in the field of trade.” Despite senior officials from both sides confirming a partial deal had been struck on issues including punitive tariffs, Beijing was notably cautious about disclosing what concessions had been made to Washington, including the quantity of agricultural goods it had agreed to purchase. The best-case scenario would be a further de-escalation of trade tensions, Shi said, adding that given the large agricultural purchases China needed to make to fulfil its side of the deal, trade talks could break down again. Over the past year, Washington has systematically placed restrictions on access to American technology by Chinese manufacturers, investors and scientists on the grounds of national security. “Selective decoupling of the two countries will continue, especially on the technology front,” Shi said. Trump says he will sign phase one US trade deal with China on January 15 15 Feb 2020 Trump says he will sign phase one US trade deal with China on January 15 15 Feb 2020 Jude Blanchette, Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, agreed. He said the tensions were expected to further fuel hawkish voices in the Chinese leadership in 2020. “Voices arguing for continued engagement with the US will be drowned out by more hawkish elements in China’s political circle, in a sense mirroring what is happening in the US,” Blanchette said. China 2019 Year in Review China 2019 Year in Review “Bolstered by Xi’s own hardline instincts, this means that the US and China will enter into a pronounced period of mutually reinforced distrust, which will further drive economic and financial decoupling.” The Chinese government has responded by intensifying its efforts to achieve self-reliance in technology, pumping cash into fledgling research centres. “Beijing will continue to build its own economic bloc to offset US efforts at economic containment and to assure overseas market access for Chinese firms, Huawei being one of the most important,” Blanchette said, naming the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker. Mainland university student among eight charged over Hong Kong protest 31 Dec 2019 Mainland university student among eight charged over Hong Kong protest 31 Dec 2019 Meanwhile, strategic confrontation, including Washington’s support for Taiwan, would continue, Shi said, with the widely expected re-election of Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s independence-leaning president, likely to provoke further moves in response from Beijing. Benefiting partly from the self-ruled island’s growing concerns as the crisis in Hong Kong unfolded, Tsai led in most opinion polls as voters prepared to vote on January 11. “If Tsai is elected and the US’ policy under President Donald Trump to offer more diplomatic and military support to Taiwan continues, the confrontation between Beijing and Taipei will only escalate,” Shi said. Beijing opened further to investment from Taiwan in 2019, while placing tighter restrictions on the Taipei administration, suspending visits to the island by individual mainland tourists and detaining a handful of Taiwanese activists on the mainland, citing national security concerns. Shi expected the Korean peninsula to contribute to rising US-China tensions in the next year. “If [North Korean leader] Kim Jong-un grows impatient about US sanctions [on the North] and gets back to testing mid-range missiles, [we can expect] China will show greater sympathy for North Korea and be more critical in dealing with the US,” he said. Russia and China last month proposed lifting some sanctions against the nuclear-armed North, on the condition of Pyongyang committing to UN Security Council resolutions on denuclearisation. Beijing toned down some assertive strategies such as its indigenous industrial policy. “A continuous strategic retreat could help improve ties with the US and other developed countries, but we don’t know if it will last,” Shi said. Hong Kong protest posts, Tokyo 2020 failure and Aethero mark 2019 5 Jan 2020 Hong Kong protest posts, Tokyo 2020 failure and Aethero mark 2019 5 Jan 2020 In 2019, China dropped its ambitious industrial plan Made in China 2025, at least nominally, from its annual government working report. It has also played down the Thousand Talents Plan, which was aimed at attracting technology talents from the US and other developed countries to Chinese laboratories. Under attack for its “debt trap diplomacy”, Beijing also established a sustainability framework to support projects under the Belt and Road Initiative, its transcontinental infrastructure strategy. But those moves came alongside a growing trend among Chinese diplomats, who took a more aggressive stance in defending China’s policies in 2019. In a speech in September, Xi called on a broad range of officials to prepare for more “struggles”, a term that harked back to the Mao Zedong era. “The Communist Party is done with playing nice, and 2020 will be the year in which we see the more nationalistic and chauvinistic steps come into full play,” Blanchette said. “Beijing will continue to keep one eye on its global reputation, but voices of restraint will be increasingly marginalised.” With domestic and international challenges continuing to arise, “the leadership’s control over Chinese society will only grow tighter”, Shi said. Hong Kong leader vows to rebuild city in new year resolution 31 Dec 2019 Hong Kong leader vows to rebuild city in new year resolution 31 Dec 2019 The party has shown little interest in scaling back its insistence on loyalty to Xi. Just after Christmas, in a two-day year-end meeting of the 25-strong Politburo, the party’s most powerful body, Xi was referred to as “People’s Leader”. While not translating into any specific new power, the label spoke volumes of the efforts to defend Xi’s personal status, against a harsh global backdrop, observers said. “It seems that [the new title] aims to put to rest any negative discussion about his leadership,” Beijing-based political commentator Zhang Lifan said. “This is a title once used by Mao and no one else … so Xi is now being put on a par with Mao.” Gu Su, a political scientist at Nanjing University, argued that the title meant little beyond an indication of symbolic power. “I don’t see anything coming next along this line yet; almost everything about consolidating Xi’s power has been done,” he said. Gu believed the biggest challenges in 2020 would come from a slowing economy. “The latest consumer price index was 4.5 per cent, the highest official figure in recent years, and pork prices are still high,” he said. “A chain reaction could affect public sentiment.” Recent official directives to protect entrepreneurs had underlined Beijing’s concern about the private sector, the driving force of the country’s growth and job market, Gu said. Indonesia protests ‘violation of sovereignty’ by Chinese coastguard 31 Dec 2019 Indonesia protests ‘violation of sovereignty’ by Chinese coastguard 31 Dec 2019 Early last month, China’s top prosecutor urged prosecutors nationwide not to prosecute or arrest business owners unless they had to. “I would say this is quite an extreme precaution for the sake of the economy,” Gu said. Also last month, Beijing prioritised social stability at its Central Economic Work Conference and subsequently promised measures to prioritise employment as it anticipated further pain for the economy, including from trade tensions with the US. China’s employment rate, considered vital to social stability, became as scrutinised as the country’s GDP, which in the third quarter grew 6 per cent – its slowest growth in nearly three decades. “I don’t see any major political risks in sight – what is happening in Hong Kong seems unlikely on the mainland,” Gu said. “But discontent with economic causes has the potential to filter through.” Purchase the China AI Report 2020 brought to you by SCMP Research and enjoy a 20% discount (original price US$400).

Under a British proposal, the post-handover government would have had to seek the Legislative Council’s approval before asking Beijing for the help of the PLA’s Hong Kong garrison for the maintenance of public order and disaster relief. It was among a number of suggested amendments to the second draft of the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution. The British government believed it would help restore the confidence of Hongkongers following the June 4 crackdown, in which the PLA was sent into Beijing to suppress pro-democracy protests. An “overall critique” of the Basic Law draft, released in February 1989, said there was great concern about the stationing of PLA troops in Hong Kong. The document, which covered proposals for amending a number of draft clauses, was sent from the Hong Kong government to Britain’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office on October 26, 1989. It suggested revising Article 14, which empowered Beijing to station troops in the city after 1997, in such a way that “military forces may be sent by the Central People’s Government to [Hong Kong] only in time of war”. It also proposed adding the sentence that the Hong Kong government, “may, if it considers it necessary to do so and if the Legislative Council approves, ask the Central People’s Government for the assistance of its military forces in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief and such forces may respond to the extent requested by the HKSAR government” to the article.

Article 14 stipulated that “military forces sent by the Central People’s Government to be stationed in Hong Kong for defence shall not interfere in the local affairs of the region. The government of the HKSAR may, in times of need, ask the Central People’s Government for assistance from the garrison in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief”. The records, which were meant to be sealed until January 2049, were declassified two weeks ago following a freedom of information request from the Post. Post An excerpt from the document.

The document said the proposals had been raised with the Chinese side at a meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group in London in September 1989, when transitional arrangements for Hong Kong’s handover were discussed. PLA soldiers sent onto streets of Hong Kong for first time since protests began 17 Nov 2019 PLA soldiers sent onto streets of Hong Kong for first time since protests began 17 Nov 2019 At the time, the Post reported that Beijing rejected the British side’s suggestion that PLA troops must not be stationed in Hong Kong. Post  On April 4, 1990, the National People’s Congress endorsed the final version of the Basic Law after a five-year drafting process. Article 14 states: “The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region may, when necessary, ask the Central People’s Government for help from the garrison in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief.”  The issue of the PLA garrison’s role in Hong Kong recently resurfaced in light of the months-long anti-government protests in the city. Defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian said in July that PLA troops could be deployed to Hong Kong to maintain social order at the request of the government, sparking concerns that the garrison could be mobilised to quell the increasingly violent protests. Meanwhile, the newly released records show a senior Chinese official sought the Hong Kong government’s help to rein in electronic media in their reports about the mainland. During a meeting in Hong Kong on October 21, 1989, Zheng Weirong, a Chinese representative of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, told then director of administration Donald Tsang Yam-kuen of “the irritation the Hong Kong media had continued to cause his elderly leaders in Peking [Beijing]”. According to a note written by Tsang, Zheng said there were instances of “wildly sensational and biased reporting” and this militated against normalisation of relations between Hong Kong and the mainland following the Tiananmen Square crackdown. Tsang went on to become financial secretary in 1995 and was elected chief executive in 2005. “[Zheng said] Could the Hong Kong government impress on the local TV and radio stations to maintain a greater measure of balance in news reporting and editorials?” Tsang wrote. “Zheng realised this was a sensitive matter, but he believed that the [Hong Kong government] had ways to exert effective influence if it were minded to do so!” The record does not show Tsang’s response.

A recent graduate from the University of Hong Kong and six months into work at a business consultancy, she said the new job was just what she had been hoping for. “When I got the offer, all I was thinking was about renting a bigger flat and getting a dog,” she recalls. But by that time the suicides had started. It was June 2019 and millions of people had taken to the streets of Hong Kong to protest against a government proposal to allow legal suspects in the city to be extradited to mainland China, among other jurisdictions, for trial. Many saw the government’s plan as an erosion of rights guaranteed under Hong Kong’s Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution. millions of people had taken to the streets of Hong Kong On June 15, a protester unfurled a banner against the extradition bill and then jumped to his death from the Pacific Place building in the Admiralty district. On June 15, a protester unfurled a banner against the extradition bill and then jumped to his death from the Pacific Place building in the Admiralty district. Internet communities in the city went on the alert as two other people committed suicide and left notes on social media that included despair about Hong Kong’s future. This raised fears the political and street turmoil was pushing some people over the edge, so online groups formed to help.  On July 3, one man posted a series of pictures on his Facebook page and a note that he planned to take his own life in protest against the government. The alert went out among internet groups to try to find and stop him. Fu, 23, was one of those who saw the alert and helped spread the message. Based on the pictures he posted, she also went looking for him on the streets. She didn’t find him, but someone else did and talked him out of it. Fu said she now refers to July 3 as her day of “awakening”. The dream job idea was ditched and she decided to enter politics to try and bring about change. Fu had attended the mass street rallies in June, but it was the anguish of looking for the man threatening suicide that changed her outlook, she said.  In one photo posted by the man, he stood in front of the government headquarters at Tamar, overlooking Victoria Harbour. The complex is designed as a gateway to symbolise the government’s openness.  “When I looked at the picture, I found it so ironic. Over a million people took to the streets twice and the government is not listening. The door is not open,” Fu said. She said she returned to her office on the afternoon of July 3 and started thinking about how to run in the upcoming district council elections. Summer of discontent Fu is one of tens of thousands of Hong Kong youths whose lives took a dramatic turn in the political turbulence that hit the city in June and then exploded into protests and violence that shook the city, rattled China, and shocked the world. exploded into protests and violence In interviews, many of those youths have said hope died in the Hong Kong government, police authorities and Beijing in the summer of 2019. The frustration that followed boiled over for some in radical action on the streets or a desire to leave Hong Kong entirely. For others like Fu, it was political participation and empowerment. And winning an election. She became one of the 115 political neophytes – average age 31 – who ran in the district council elections on November 24 and upended the local political landscape. Of that number of first-time runners, 81 won seats as part of a larger “pro-democracy” bloc that took over 17 of Hong Kong’s 18 district councils in a landslide win. district council elections Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing camp reeling after crushing defeat in district council elections Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing camp reeling after crushing defeat in district council elections After the loss, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor apologised to the pro-government parties, saying it reflected voter dissatisfaction with the government. While Fu chose to oppose Hong Kong government policy through the ballot box, other youth chose a more radical route that led to street battles with the police and escalating levels of violence and vandalism. A leaked audio recording by Lam in September revealed the government believed mass arrests of radicals was the solution. leaked audio recording “With a little bit of hope that may help because we are seeing the numbers reducing. We started off by an estimate of about one to two thousand protesters who are very violent. Or put it that way, they are very willing to resort to violence,” she told the business community in a closed-door meeting. But as the number of those arrested approached 6,000, the violence continued. Protests and demonstrations by university students are common all over the world, but in Hong Kong hundreds of secondary school students as young as 12 started to show up on the arrest rosters of the police. From June to November 21, the total number of protest-related arrests reached 5,856. Of that number, 742 were aged between 15 and 17. Another 159 were between 12 and 14, according to the Hong Kong Security Bureau. One of these unlikely radicals is a bespectacled 13-year-old from a middle-class family, who asked to be identified by the pseudonym Kenny to discuss his other life, away from books and homework, among tear gas and rubber bullets. “Before June, I spent all my after-school hours playing mobile games. My only worry was whether my girlfriend would break up with me. I never paid attention to politics before June,” he said. The off-duty police officer and paramedic who aid injured protesters 15 Feb 2020 The off-duty police officer and paramedic who aid injured protesters 15 Feb 2020 On July 12, Kenny said he went to the rally where tens of thousands of demonstrators protested against the extradition bill outside the government headquarters. He said he went for two reasons; he was angry the government hadn’t withdrawn the bill and he wanted to meet his girlfriend. “It was quite calm when I got there and I just stood and watched. I was wearing a surgical mask,” he said. Suddenly tensions rose and the police fired tear gas at protesters. Kenny said he wasn’t expecting the violence that followed. He said a police officer hit him with a baton and other officers joined in when he fell to the ground. “I really didn’t expect I would be beaten so hard. I managed to get away and ran. Volunteer medics helped me. I had bruises all over.” While he said the experience infuriated him, it was on July 21 when a group of men with clubs attacked protesters and passengers at Yuen Long MTR station that he decided a radical approach was warranted. “It angered me and prompted me to go to the front line,” he said. group of men with clubs attacked protesters and passengers at Yuen Long MTR station Kenny said he then attended protests where he was hit by rubber and beanbag bullets, and even a tear gas cannister. He said he met university students and high school students when they fought the police, but not many his age. Protests could trigger a mental health crisis, experts warn 4 Jul 2019 Protests could trigger a mental health crisis, experts warn 4 Jul 2019 He said his parents knew he was going to protests but not that he was in the thick of the violence. He said he still attended school during the day, though he would often doze off in classes. He rejected allegations that radical protesters are paid agitators. Beijing has said foreign nations intent on undermining the Communist Party on the mainland are inciting and funding the Hong Kong protests. “How much money can you offer a young person to sacrifice his or her future and face 10 years of jail [for rioting]? It is nonsense.” But he said he stopped going to the front line of protests when the stress started to take its toll. “I woke up several times at night from nightmares. There are flashbacks during the day where I would automatically lift my arm to defend myself. I would freeze at the sight of police,” he said. In one clash in October, Kenny said he suffered a panic attack and froze as a police officer pointed his firearm at protesters throwing bricks. He was dragged away by others and he realised he had lost the ability to protect himself. The trouble with turning Hong Kong’s young people into ‘patriotic youth’ 21 Aug 2019 The trouble with turning Hong Kong’s young people into ‘patriotic youth’ 21 Aug 2019 Kenny said the six months of protests had fractured his trust in the authorities and by extension his identity as a Chinese. “I could not tell the difference between a Hongkonger and a mainland Chinese before June. For me, they were the same thing. Now I prefer being a Hongkonger to a Chinese,” he said. In a press conference on October 4, Chief Executive Lam said she was alarmed by the number of young students involved in violent protests. “We have to use all our effort to stop violence and stop students from breaking the law in order to save Hong Kong and its future,” she said. Lesson in politics This loss of confidence in the authorities has prompted some student activists to seek support from overseas for their cause. Chan Wing-yan, 18, of Lingnan University is one of them. She joined the Occupy movement of civil disobedience in 2014 when in junior high school, but said she lived the normal life of a teenage girl since then. In March 2019, she began attending protests against the extradition bill. Chan Wing-yan, 18, of Lingnan University is one of them. She joined the Occupy movement of civil disobedience in 2014 when in Occupy movement of civil disobedience in 2014 In early December, she was part of a student delegation to Taiwan to lobby for “a refugee law” for Hong Kong fugitives. But she and other delegates were given a rude introduction to politics when Taiwanese opposition parties used their appeal to attack Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen for not doing enough to assist them. “We are just kids. But now we are forced to think about politics, we have to worry if we say something wrong to the media. It is like shouldering the whole world. At the same time, I have to do homework and prepare for exams.” In response to Beijing’s allegations that the protest movement in Hong Kong is being used by foreign forces to undermine China, Chan said they looked overseas because they didn’t see any other way to get the Hong Kong and Beijing governments to heed their demands. protest movement in Hong Kong “We have run out of means. As an international city, it is normal for us to come up with the idea to lobby overseas governments,” she said. Fu, the new district councillor in Hong Kong, is taking a different approach at home, using her family’s ancestral ties to Fujian province in mainland China to build links with residents in her constituency, a stronghold of pro-Beijing descendants from Fujian. The councillor she replaced was in office for 14 years, a member of the pro-government Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong. In early August, scuffles broke out between men with Fujian accents and anti-government protesters in North Point, an area where Fu campaigned. She went there to film the scene and one man slapped her mobile phone out of her hand. “I was so surprised that I was attacked by fellow Fujianese,” she said. But Fu said she was ready to talk with those that had different political stances. “As a district councillor voted in by the public, I will connect with different sectors in my constituency. We need to connect,” she said. And she said it would be a good idea for the chief executive to do the same. “Why doesn’t Carrie Lam go to all the 18 districts in Hong Kong and have open and public discussions with the district councillors?” Read the first part in the series, on the implications of the pro-democrats’ landslide win in the district council polls, here, the second part, on the city’s special role as a gateway into mainland China, here, and the third part, on the risks and rewards for foreign professionals in Hong Kong, here.

Among 38 people who penned an open letter to the city leader were John Bercow, former speaker of the British House of Commons, Malcolm Rifkind, former British foreign secretary, Cardinal Charles Maung Bo, president of the Federation of Asian Bishops Conferences, Alissa Wahid, daughter of late Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid, and politicians from Australia, Canada, Ireland, Lithuania, and the United States. They urged Lam to rethink the government’s position on the matter and listen to the demands of anti-government protesters, as they said they were “horrified” to see tear gas and pepper spray fired at demonstrators and bystanders in protests during the Christmas holiday. anti-government protesters Police have accused radical protesters of vandalising shops in malls across the city, where officers arrested more than 200 people for disturbances in various districts last week, driving the total arrest figure to 6,494 over seven months of political unrest. “We appeal to you to use your authority and exercise your responsibility to seek genuine ways forward out of this crisis by addressing the grievances of Hong Kong people, bringing the Hong Kong Police Force under control, ensuring accountability and an end to impunity for serious violations of human rights, and beginning a process of democratic political reform,” the letter read. Resignations from police watchdog’s protests review ‘reveal system flaws’ 11 Dec 2019 Resignations from police watchdog’s protests review ‘reveal system flaws’ 11 Dec 2019 They said though nothing could justify violence, a small section of protesters had become violent in desperation as the government refused to listen to them. They urged the government to heed protesters’ demands by establishing an independent inquiry into police conduct during the protests, release those arrested for taking part in peaceful demonstrations, and consider political reform.  “Should you continue to reject this idea, we call on the international community to establish an international, independent inquiry mechanism,” they wrote. CORONAVIRUS UPDATE Get updates direct to your inbox SUBSCRIBE They have not specified what form of international inquiry they supported. In June 2020, the United Nations Human Rights Committee is expected to scrutinise Hong Kong’s compliance with human rights under the international treaty, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Some people have launched online petitions asking international courts to review the situation in Hong Kong. Any investigation, however, has to be triggered by a complaint from a sovereign state, the UN, or human rights bodies. Overseas experts advising police watchdog on Hong Kong protests quit their jobs 11 Dec 2019 Overseas experts advising police watchdog on Hong Kong protests quit their jobs 11 Dec 2019 The signatories to the letter warned there could be other outcomes if the government failed to make concessions for protesters.  “Failure to seize this opportunity … may also result in even more vocal calls for targeted Magnitsky sanctions against officials in Hong Kong directly or indirectly responsible for human rights violations. It is our hope that you choose a path of constructive and meaningful reform which makes reconciliation and healing possible,” they said. The group was referring to the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which allows the US government to sanction foreign government officials implicated in human rights abuses anywhere in the world. In November, US President Donald Trump signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act into law, which could pave the way for diplomatic action and economic sanctions against Hong Kong’s government for any conduct that may be perceived by the US to have violated Hongkongers’ rights and freedoms. signed The European Union is drafting a similar law, while Australia is conducting a public consultation about it. The Post has reached out to the Hong Kong government for a response. Post US Act changes nothing for Hong Kong’s protesters 8 Dec 2019 US Act changes nothing for Hong Kong’s protesters 8 Dec 2019 After the withdrawal of the extradition bill, which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to mainland China for trial, Lam has refused to make any further concessions to meet protesters’ other demands, which include the setting up of a judge-led commission of inquiry into police’s use of force. Lam said the government would instead invite experts to join a review committee to examine the causes behind the unrest.  Meanwhile, the police watchdog – the Independent Police Complaints Council – is reviewing the force’s handling of protests and will release its first interim report in late January or early February. Lam’s office on Tuesday refused to comment on whether it had received the interim report. No government would tolerate such action or bow to such pressure Hong Kong government spokesman In a long statement released at about 1am on Wednesday, a government spokesman refuted the claims made in the open letter as unfounded and misguided. “We are gravely concerned that the claims are biased and misleading. The HKSAR government must rebut them to ensure they truly understand the extent of violence by radical protesters and the attacks they have made on police and citizens.” The spokesman said no protesters had been killed as a result of direct police action while 520 officers were injured, adding that the extent of students and minors being involved in such violent protests was particularly worrying. He said police did not initiate actions against protesters and only responded with proportionate force consistent with international human rights standards. The spokesman also rejected the suggestion of an international independent inquiry mechanism. “Such action, coupled with the threat of Magnitsky sanctions, would be a gross interference in Hong Kong’s governance and autonomy as well as the sovereignty of our nation. “No government would tolerate such action or bow to such pressure.” The Hong Kong government also defended the city’s freedoms, citing the extensive global media coverage which was “unprecedented” in the city’s history. “That in itself is evidence enough that freedom of the press is well protected, and citizens of Hong Kong continue to enjoy the freedom of participating in lawful and peaceful demonstrations to express their views.” 	SCMP

Here’s a look at how they ushered in 2020 and the new decade. Hong Kong Hong Kong Revellers as well as pro-democracy protesters flocked to sites across Hong Kong to usher in 2020. The semi-autonomous toned down New Year’s celebrations amid the months-long demonstrations, which have repeatedly sparked pitched battles with police. A fireworks display that traditionally lights up famed Victoria Harbour was cancelled amid safety concerns, while some roads were closed and barriers set up in the Lan Kwai Fong nightlife district to control crowds. Read the full Hong Kong coverage here. Read the full Hong Kong coverage here. China China December 31 is usually a calm day in China. The real celebrations wait for January 25, with the start of the new year in the traditional Chinese lunar calendar. Next year is the year of the rat.  On a rainy night in the Taiwanese capital Taipei hundreds of thousands packed the downtown area for a fireworks display at the 509-metre (1,700-foot) tall Taipei 101 high-rise building, one of the tallest buildings in the world. The five-minute fireworks show at midnight included 16,000 fireworks combined with animations featuring Taiwan on a giant wall of 140,000 LED bulbs on the building’s exterior from the 35th to the 90th floor.    Russia Russia Russians began the world’s longest continuous New Year’s Eve with fireworks and a message from President Vladimir Putin urging them to work together in the coming year. Putin made the call in a short speech broadcast on television just before the stroke of midnight in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. The recorded message was followed by an image of the Kremlin Clock and the sound of its chimes. State television showed footage of extensive festive fireworks in cities of the Far East.  But one holiday tradition was missing in Moscow this year – a picturesque layer of snow. The Russian capital has had an unusually warm December and temperatures in central Moscow as midnight approached were just above freezing. Australia Australia More than a million people descended on a hazy Sydney Harbour and surrounding areas to ring in of the new year despite the ongoing bush fire crisis ravaging New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state.  The 9pm fireworks over Sydney’s iconic landmarks was briefly delayed due to strong winds, but revellers clearly enjoyed themselves in a desperately needed tonic for the state. New South Wales has born the brunt of the bush fire damage, which has razed more than 1,000 homes nationwide and killed 12 people in the past few months. Japan Japan People flocked to temples and shrines in Japan, offering incense with their prayers to celebrate the passing of a year and the first New Year’s of the Reiwa era. Under Japan’s old-style calendar, linked to emperors’ rules, Reiwa started in May, after Emperor Akihito stepped down and his son Naruhito became emperor. Although Reiwa is entering its second year with 2020, January 1 still marks Reiwa’s first New Year’s, the most important holiday in Japan. Stalls at Zojoji Temple in Tokyo sold sweet rice wine, fried noodles and candied apples, as well as little amulets in the shape of mice, the zodiac animal for 2020. Since the Year of the Mouse starts off the Asian zodiac, it’s associated with starting anew.Tokyo will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, an event that is creating much anticipation for the entire nation. Indonesia Indonesia Tens of thousands of revellers in Indonesia’s capital of Jakarta were soaked by torrential rains as they waited for New Year’s Eve fireworks while others in the country were wary of an active volcano. Festive events along coastal areas near the Sunda Strait were dampened by a possible larger eruption of Anak Krakatoa, an island volcano that erupted last year just ahead of Christmas Day, triggering a tsunami that killed more than 430 people. The country’s volcanology agency has warned locals and tourists to stay 2km (1.3 miles) from the volcano’s crater following an eruption Tuesday that blasted ash and debris up to 2,000 metres (6,560 feet) into the air. South Korea South Korea Thousands of South Koreans filled cold downtown streets in Seoul ahead of a traditional bell-tolling ceremony near City Hall to send off an exhausting 2019 highlighted by political scandals, decaying job markets and crumbling diplomacy with North Korea. Dignitaries ringing the old Bosingak bell at midnight included South Korean Major League Baseball pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu and Pengsoo, a giant penguin character with a gruff voice and blunt personality that emerged as one of the country’s biggest television stars in 2019. India India Thousands of Indians gathered in front of the iconic Gateway of India in Mumbai for the annual fireworks. Meanwhile, however, thousands ushered in the year by demonstrating against a citizenship law they say will discriminate against Muslims and chip away at India’s secular constitution. Demonstrations were planned in New Delhi, in the grip of its second coldest winter in more than a century, as well as Mumbai and other cities, despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attempts to dampen demonstrations that have run for nearly three weeks. Irshad Alam, a 25-year-old resident of the Shaheen Bagh area of New Delhi, stood with his 1-year-old in his arm and his wife by his side. He said he had been taking part in the protest every day. “It’s freezing here,” he said. “But we are still here because we care about this movement.” More than 200 people gathered in and around a makeshift stage in the Muslim neighbourhood chanting slogans and reciting poetry. Paris Paris A joyful crowd of Parisians and tourists walked, biked and used scooters to reach the Champs-Elysees for the new year celebrations, in a city with almost no public transport amid massive strikes. Revelers converged at the famous avenue to watch a light show at the Arc de Triomphe, followed by a fireworks display at midnight. Paris police set up a security perimeter around the Champs-Elysees area with a ban on alcohol and traffic restrictions. All metro lines in the French capital were closed except for two automatic lines, and only a few night buses were running, as Tuesday marked the 27th consecutive day of transport strikes against President Emmanuel Macron’s plans to overhaul the French pension system. Rome Rome Pope Francis delighted tourists and Romans in St. Peter’s Square on Tuesday night when he took a stroll to admire the Nativity scene. Shouts of “Pope! Pope!” and “Happy New Year!” resounded as families rushed to catch a glimpse of him or thrust out their infant in hopes he would pat their heads or pinch their cheeks. One woman grabbed the pope’s hand and pulled him toward her to shake it. Francis, 83, exclaimed and then struck the woman’s hand twice to free his hand. At a New Year’s Eve Vespers service in St. Peter’s Basilica, Francis urged people to practice more solidarity and to “build bridges, not walls.” Since becoming pontiff in 2013, Francis has preached openness — a reform-minded agenda that has irritated a small but vocal group of ultra-conservatives in the church. London London Londoners watched a spectacular fireworks display from the banks of the River Thames that was launched from the London Eye and barges near Parliament. The familiar chimes of London’s Big Ben clock tower rung in the new year, even though they have been silent for most of 2019 because of extensive restoration work. To the north, the multi-day Hogmanay New Year’s celebrations in Edinburgh began Monday night with a torchlight parade through the streets of the Scottish capital. Security was tight in both cities and elsewhere in Britain following a recent extremist attack on London Bridge that claimed two lives. Police arrested five men on suspicion of terrorism offenses Monday but said the arrests were not related to the London Bridge attack or to celebrations. New York New York Fireworks burst and confetti fell as throngs of revelers cheered the start of 2020 in New York City’s Times Square. In one of the globe’s most-watched New Year’s Eve spectacles, the crowd counted down the last seconds of 2019 as a luminescent crystal ball descended down a pole. About 1,360kg of confetti showered the sea of attendees, many of whom were also briefly rained on earlier in the evening as they waited in security pens for performances by stars including rap-pop star Post Malone, K-pop group BTS, country singer Sam Hunt and singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette. The crowds packed into the heart of Manhattan mouthed lyrics and waved yellow and purple balloons in a frenzy as midnight approached. The fun was evident, but some important global issues were driven home as well. Spotlighting efforts to combat climate change, high school science teachers and students pressed the button that begins the famous 60-second ball drop and countdown to the new year.

One of the trio is suspected to be the person who was holding the drain cover, while the other two were accompanying him. The man suspected of holding the drain cover was charged with attempted assault and attempted unlawful assembly, while the other two were charged with assisting the assault and attempted unlawful assembly, police said at a press conference on Tuesday night. The three men, aged between 33 and 34, claimed to be self-employed as interior designers. They were arrested separately in Ap Lei Chau, Tsuen Wan and Central.

A manhunt was on for a month since the 53-year-old victim suffered serious head injuries in the attack on December 1 at the junction of Nathan Road and Mong Kok Road in Mong Kok. He was sent to Kwong Wah Hospital in Yau Ma Tei for treatment and was discharged later.  A video that captured the incident online showed the victim was removing barricades on his own when several masked protesters approached him, yelling abuse. The victim took out his mobile phone in an apparent attempt to record what was happening, when a mask-wearing man lunged at him and hit him with the drain cover.  The victim fell to the ground and was seen bleeding from his head. A first-aid volunteer rushed to his rescue.   On that night, large groups of protesters gathered in Mong Kok and Prince Edward in Kowloon to mark three months of a mob dispersal operation by riot police at Prince Edward railway station.  Separately, police arrested six men and one woman, aged 19 to 56, on Tuesday in relation to offences such as unlawful assembly, arson and assault, during protests on October 6, October 20 and November 2.

Delivering his New Year’s Eve speech on state television, Xi said the city could only thrive if the unrest ended. “Without a harmonious and stable environment, how can there be a home where people can live and work peacefully and happily?” Xi said. “[We] sincerely hope for the best for Hong Kong and our compatriots in Hong Kong.” He also said that building a stable and prosperous Hong Kong was the “common wish” of all Chinese people. Without directly blaming protesters for causing the biggest political crisis in Hong Kong since the 1997 handover, Xi praised Macau for its achievement in putting the “one country, two systems” formula into practice. “I recently visited Macau to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its reunification with the motherland and I am pleased to see a prosperous and stable Macau,” he said.  “The success of Macau has fully demonstrated that ‘one country, two systems’ is totally practicable, deliverable and welcomed by the people.” Xi made no mention of the trade war with the United States in his address but said the mainland had continued its opening up policy over the past year, showing the outside world that China was “civilised, open and tolerant”. In New Year’s Eve speech, Xi Jinping ‘hopes for the best’ for Hong Kong in 2020 In New Year’s Eve speech, Xi Jinping ‘hopes for the best’ for Hong Kong in 2020 He said 2020 would be a year of milestones as China has set a number of major targets for the new year including eradicating poverty and delivering a middle-income living standard for most people in the country.  While the president did not make any economic projections for 2020 in his speech, he vowed that China would press ahead to “build a better future for all mankind”.  Xi’s speech followed a commentary in Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily which said that China’s rise was peaceful and it did not want to “lord it over” other countries. People’s Daily People’s Daily Tuesday’s year-end commentary said Beijing would keep its promise to open up and contribute to the world economy and improve global governance.

China 2019 Year in Review China 2019 Year in Review The commentary sought to send a message that China was not seeking to displace the US, just as Beijing and Washington prepare to sign an interim deal to defuse trade tensions. Partly as a result of the trade war with the US, China saw its economy grow by 6 per cent in the third quarter of 2019, slower than expected. The modest growth rate was believed to be China’s slowest GDP gain in more than two decades.

While no fierce clashes were reported, the shopping district of Mong Kok was the main flashpoint as radical protesters blocked roads, started fires, let off fireworks and disrupted traffic, prompting police to fire several rounds of tear gas. New Year’s Eve protests in Hong Kong New Year’s Eve protests in Hong Kong Well into the early hours of New Year’s Day, protesters and riot police officers were locked in a stand-off on Nathan Road. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd, and a first-aid volunteer was hit. Renowned writer Tang Siu-wa said she was hit by a tear-gas canister in the corner of her left eye and was left bleeding heavily.  In neighbouring Yau Ma Tei, at least five rounds of tear gas were fired on Waterloo Road shortly after protesters were warned by police that they were taking part in an unlawful assembly. Earlier, more than 1,000 people had formed human chains in various districts, including Causeway Bay, Wan Chai, Tai Po and Tuen Mun, and along Nathan Road from Tsim Sha Tsui to Mong Kok. Some also marched along the Tsim Sha Tsui promenade, calling on citizens to join a New Year’s Day protest march by chanting, “January 1, see you in Victoria Park”.  Promenades on both sides of Victoria Harbour are normally prime, packed spots for viewing the traditional New Year’s Eve fireworks display, but with the event cancelled for the first time in 10 years due to police opposition, the crowds were thinner on Tuesday night. The display was replaced by an enhanced version of the daily laser light-and-music show on both sides of the harbour.

Riot police were later deployed to clear the crowd and a mini bulldozer was sent to remove the barricades. Riot police stopped and searched protesters and shoppers near the atrium of Harbour City in Tsim Sha Tsui and on the ground floor of Times Square, after dozens of people heeded the calls to stage “shopping protests” in the two popular malls in the evening. About 30 mostly black-clad demonstrators had earlier started walking around in Times Square, chanting slogans and stopping escalators by pressing the emergency buttons. They also entered some shops, including Adidas, where they knocked clothes on the floor. Some protesters said the sports apparel store was targeted because the company used mainland actress Liu Yifei in its latest advert. Liu, who stars in the new Mulan movie, had previously expressed support for Hong Kong’s embattled police force. Mulan Many who joined the protest in Times Square said there was no reason for revelry this new year. “There is nothing to celebrate because many have made sacrifices. Many brave young people have been arrested for our future, including some who I believe sacrificed their lives,” said a 40-something mother, surnamed Lo, who joined the protest with her 10-year-old son. Hong Kong has been rocked by anti-government protests, sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, since June. So far, police have arrested more than 6,500 people for offences related to the protests. Of those arrested, about 2,600 were students. Another white-collar worker in his 20s, surnamed Leung, said his new year wish was to “liberate Hong Kong” and that the five core demands, which included an independent probe into police’s handing of protests and the implementation of universal suffrage, could be achieved. Over at Prince Edward metro station, police fired pepper spray to disperse protesters who were there to commemorate the four-month anniversary of the August 31 incident, in which police went after radicals into train compartments and were later accused of attacking regular commuters. At least four people were subdued. In Lan Kwai Fong, a businessman surnamed Chan, who operates a partywear store, said he was ready to close his shop at any moment if clashes erupted. “Business has been hit in the past six months. It is okay as long as police don’t start firing tear gas. If they do, everyone leaves and there will be no customers,” he said. An insurance agent, surnamed Mei, who moved to the city from the mainland a decade ago, was promoting products to Chinese tourists outside Harbour City. She said she had no income in July and August because of the plunge in mainland tourists amid the protests. “My new year wish is that Hong Kong will be peaceful again soon,” she said. “I really like Hong Kong. I hope the city will return to its normal status where you work and you gain.” In Mong Kok, an advertising display outside a McDonald’s branch at the junction of Nathan Road and Kansu Street was vandalised by men clad in black. Some protesters who arrived later chanted: “Don’t eat food from a state-owned company!” The McDonald’s franchise in Hong Kong is operated by state-owned conglomerate Citic and Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. Ahead of Wednesday’s pro-democracy march, police said they had discovered six plastic jerry cans of petrol along with 51 empty bottles on a hillside in Tsz Wan Shan, which they suspected were to be used to make petrol bombs to cause chaos at public events around new year. Chief Inspector Wong Yi-wai, of Kowloon East regional crime unit, said police learned the site was being used to store the dangerous goods from suspects who were arrested on Tuesday morning in connection with violent acts during recent protests. Wong said the amount seized was enough to produce more than 100 petrol bombs. “Police have reasons to believe [the petrol bombs] would have been used at public events today or tomorrow and the purpose was to cause panic and chaos,” he said. The march, organised by the Civil Human Rights Front, would set off from Victoria Park at 2pm to Chater Road in Central. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Tourism Board “sincerely apologised for the disappointment and inconvenience” after its new year lucky draw, which offered more than HK$4 million (US$513,000), crashed minutes after its launch on Tuesday evening.

Fanling Court heard on Tuesday that Guangdong Polytechnic Normal University student He Zhenyu, 20, had caused a commotion along with four local teenagers – including a 14-year-old boy – by shouting at customers at a Mannings pharmacy in the Landmark North shopping centre in Sheung Shui. After customers left and the pharmacy closed, the five students dropped screws and advertising posters on the shop floor through gaps in the folding gate at the entrance, senior prosecutor Alan Yau Sik-lun said. He, together with Sin Ka-hei, 18, Cheng Tsz-shun, 18, Jerry Chan Yu-kwan, 16, and the 14-year-old, were charged with one joint count of disorderly conduct in a public place. Two others, unemployed Cheng Ka-leung, 24, and cook Fung Man-tat, 27, faced another joint count of assaulting a police officer, after they allegedly attacked two officers who rushed to the scene to arrest offenders. The prosecution only identified the officers as X and Y.  Yau said officer X was punched in the left eye and face while officer Y was slapped in the head. A 14-year-old girl was charged with possession of offensive weapons, after officers intercepted her in the vicinity and found she had a 30cm hammer.  The eight defendants were not required to enter a plea, as acting Principal Magistrate Don So Man-lung adjourned the case until April 14 pending further police inquiries.  Yau said the force would examine the screws and posters seized at the scene and inspect security camera footage. So released all the defendants on HK$5,000 (US$641) cash bail, but imposed a travel ban and curfew on them. He also ordered them to report to police twice a week, and banned them from setting foot in the Landmark North mall. He, the mainland student, had a seven-day permit to visit Hong Kong and the magistrate told him to apply to the Immigration Department for an extension because of the case. So dismissed the defence’s application for an exception to the curfew requirement on New Year’s Eve. The eight defendants were among 20 people arrested during the protest on Saturday. Ten men and a woman were released on police bail and must report back again in February. Chan Chun-hin, 16, who was accused of robbing an officer’s gun in the rally, was charged with three counts at Fanling Court on Monday. His bail application was declined. 	SCMP

Only 2.65 million people visited Hong Kong in the month, or 88,000 daily, according to latest figures released by the Hong Kong Tourism Board. When Sars hit the city 16 years ago, tourist arrivals in the months of April and May that year fell more than 60 per cent from the same period the previous year. Tourist arrivals were especially worse during November 11 to 20, when protesters were engaged in violent clashes with police on the campuses of Chinese University (CUHK) and Polytechnic University (PolyU). Only 67,000 tourists arrived a day on average during this period. The CUHK campus in Sha Tin was occupied by radical protesters for five days last month, whereas PolyU was the scene of ugly clashes for 13 days. Tourist arrivals improved slightly on the last 10 days of the month, at about 87,000 a day. Tourist arrivals in Hong Kong down 43.7 per cent year on year in October 30 Nov 2019 Tourist arrivals in Hong Kong down 43.7 per cent year on year in October 30 Nov 2019 In the first 11 months of this year, tourist arrivals fell 10 per cent year on year to 53 million. Hong Kong recorded a 14 per cent year-on-year growth in arrivals for the first half of the year and a 36 per cent decline between July and November.  In the beginning of the year, the board forecast the figure would climb 1.9 per cent to a record 66.4 million in 2019. Ricky Tse Kam-ting, founding president of the Hong Kong Inbound Tour Operators’ Association, said he was not surprised at the record slump and expected worse days to come as mainland tourists were assaulted in Sheung Shui shopping malls during Christmas. “I have been in the industry for 40 years, and the situation now is the worst,” Tse said. “During the Sars outbreak, people worked together to boost the economy. But now, it’s like a long war with no end in sight.”  Tse said many countries and cities had stopped promoting Hong Kong tourism, while people in the mainland were also worried they would be assaulted if they came to the city.  “The whole industry is worried, and there’s little we can do at the moment.” Hong Kong’s hotel sector is in free fall as protests keep tourists away 17 Sep 2019 Hong Kong’s hotel sector is in free fall as protests keep tourists away 17 Sep 2019 In a blog post last Sunday, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said he expected negative GDP growth in the fourth quarter, amid gloomy figures in retail sales and visitor arrivals, and rising unemployment rates in certain industries. “Although the statistics for the fourth quarter will be out only early next year, judging from the situation of the past few months, a continued negative growth seems unavoidable,” he wrote. Hard times for Hong Kong’s tourism workers as protests keep visitors away 7 Dec 2019 Hard times for Hong Kong’s tourism workers as protests keep visitors away 7 Dec 2019 The government said new measures would be rolled out next month and in the coming budget to help Hong Kong businesses survive the downturn. Hong Kong has been rocked by anti-government protests since June, which, coupled with the US-China trade war, have pushed the city into recession. The economy shrank 3.2 per cent in the third quarter from the previous one, while GDP was down 2.9 per cent year on year, the biggest contraction in a decade. Chan cited the record drop of 26 per cent in retail sales in October, a more than 50 per cent fall in visitors over the Christmas holiday, and a six-year high unemployment rate of more than 6 per cent in the catering industry. He also said the government would have its first budget deficit in 15 years in the 2019/20 financial year. 	SCMP

The haul of six plastic jerry cans of petrol was discovered along with 51 empty bottles on a hillside off Shatin Pass Road near Lion Rock Country Park in Tsz Wan Shan, according to Chief Inspector Wong Yi-wai of Kowloon East regional crime unit. He said police learned the site was being used to store the dangerous goods from suspects who were arrested on Tuesday morning in connection with violent acts during recent anti-government protests. Wong said the amount seized was enough to produce more than 100 petrol bombs. “Police have reasons to believe [the petrol bombs] would have been used at public events today or tomorrow and the purpose was to cause panic and chaos,” he said. Sources told the Post on Monday that more than 6,000 police officers would be deployed to handle protest chaos over the new year. Post  In a video posted on the force’s Facebook page, police chief Chris Tang Ping-keung vowed to ramp up efforts to arrest people who broke the law. Police appealed to the public, especially youngsters, not to be incited into making or storing petrol bombs or other such raw materials. Wong said police treated petrol bombs as offensive weapons as well as explosives. “The only aim of making petrol bombs is to endanger life or property,” he said.  In Hong Kong, attempts to cause an explosion or making or keeping explosives with intent to endanger life or property carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in jail under the Crimes Ordinance.  Wong also said it was irresponsible to store the petrol in a place near a hiking path, posing a danger to hikers. The chief inspector said police were still investigating how long the goods had been hidden there. He did not disclose how many people were arrested in the operation on Tuesday morning. Last month, police found more than 10,000 petrol bombs at several universities after protesters barricaded themselves on campuses and fought officers. Since June, Hong Kong has been rocked by anti-government protests, sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill. So far, police have arrested more than 6,500 people for offences related to the protests. Of those arrested, about 2,600 were students. 	SCMP

The government released a three-minute video featuring Lam, alongside three other ministers on the last day of a turbulent 2019, which ended with the chief executive wishing to restore order and harmony in the new year. “In 2019, we experienced challenges not seen before. The unrest triggered by the introduction of the extradition bill has lasted more than six months,” Lam said. “We all want to see an end to this predicament. This situation has caused sadness, anxiety, disappointment and even rage. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam vows in new year video address to rebuild city and bear responsibilities Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam vows in new year video address to rebuild city and bear responsibilities “As the chief executive, I will not shy away from my responsibilities. I will listen humbly to find a way out,” she said, adding the government had to handle the problems at hand and acknowledge shortcomings in the system as well as the deep-rooted conflicts in society. The video used footage of a massive protest march and featured shots of damaged street facilities, without any scenes of violent confrontation between protesters and police.  The ongoing unrest was sparked in June by the now-withdrawn extradition bill that could have resulted in fugitives being sent to jurisdictions including mainland China to face trial. It morphed into a wider campaign for greater democracy and an independent inquiry into police’s handling of protests. “I believe we can once again overcome our current challenges and rebuild Hong Kong. Let’s start 2020 with a new resolution to restore order and harmony in society,” Lam said.  “So we can begin again, together.” Law Chi-kwong, the secretary for labour and welfare, also appeared in the video and said the government would “substantially improve the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance and Working Family Allowance schemes”.  Frank Chan Fan, secretary for transport and housing, said his bureau had been working hard to find land to boost the housing supply and reduce the time it takes to build homes. Reviewing several rounds of relief measures launched for the business sector and the public, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said the city would overcome the current hardships and scale new heights as long as social order was restored. Happy New Year from Hong Kong – and bah humbug! Happy New Year from Hong Kong – and bah humbug! The video was uploaded as protesters prepared for another mass rally to be held on New Year’s Day. Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, convenor of Civil Human Rights Front, organiser of the march, said there was no way Lam’s video would gain sympathy from the public or help to ease anger. “Hong Kong people have learned in the past half-year not to listen to what politicians say, but watch what they do,” Sham said. “The government basically did nothing to react to the public’s demands.” He believed a huge crowd would join the rally and demand the government respond directly to the people, who want an independent probe. Chinese University political scientist Ma Ngok said the video was useless, and that “no one would love to hear the chief executive’s empty words and promises”. Worse still, Ma said the video included other secretaries whose popularity was also low. “The only positive reason she talks to her people through a video is that she can hide from all criticisms or questions.” Additional reporting by Lilian Cheng Additional reporting by Lilian Cheng 	SCMP

Those who joined the MTR before October 1, have a minimum of three months’ active service in Hong Kong since June and are under employment on December 31 will be eligible for the reward. The rail operator became a key target of radical protesters after they accused it of kowtowing to Beijing following a scathing attack by mainland Chinese media. They also accused the MTR of colluding with police by shutting stations near protest sites and reducing services, labelling it “Communist Rail”.  Hong Kong has been rocked by more than six months of anti-government protests, triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed the government to consider requests for extradition of criminal suspects to jurisdictions with which it had no existing agreement, including mainland China. six months of anti-government protests In September, a supervisor at Po Lam MTR station ended up in hospital following an attack by protesters who were angry that the station had been shut down when there were clashes between demonstrators and police. supervisor at Po Lam MTR station A month later, the entire rail network shut down for the first time in its 40-year history due to vandalism and attacks on staff, after Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor invoked a colonial-era emergency law to ban wearing masks at protests. shut down for the first time in its 40-year history  Since the start of the protests, radicals had caused extensive damage to 85 of 94 MTR stations and 62 of 68 Light Rail stops.   “This year has been very tough for our colleagues. Not only did they deal with the social movement in the second half of the year, they also swiftly recovered from several accidents and adhered to company arrangements.

The Hong Kong Association of the Heads of Secondary Schools also accused Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung of failing to spell out what unsuitable meant, and urged his bureau to have trust in principals’ professionalism. Yeung made the comments in an interview with online news outlet Shanghai Observer, operated by Communist Party newspaper Jiefang Daily, on the ongoing anti-government protests. Jiefang Daily When asked how his bureau would act if schools or heads did not cooperate when probing protest-related complaints against teachers, Yeung said the permanent secretary for education had the power to disqualify principals who were not up to the job. Under the Education Ordinance, the permanent secretary may withdraw a principal’s appointment approval for failure to perform duties satisfactorily, or for being unacceptable to most of the school’s managers. “For example, when a school tells us in feedback that the teacher involved is ‘not problematic’, then we might know the school or the principal’s attitude might be ‘problematic’, so we can handle the issue from a management perspective,” he said.  Yeung said the Education Bureau was able to appoint members to a school’s management committee but this power would be exercised cautiously. Advisers to Hong Kong’s leader considered resigning en masse 29 Dec 2019 Advisers to Hong Kong’s leader considered resigning en masse 29 Dec 2019 “In serious cases, if [a principal] is deemed unsuitable to be a teacher, the bureau can even revoke his or her teaching qualifications,” he said. But for minor cases it would ask the school’s sponsoring body to work with the managers to help the heads do their job well, Yeung said.  The bureau said about 80 teachers and teaching assistants had been arrested over the protests while at least four were suspended or had resigned. Among the 123 complaints of protest-related misconduct against teachers the bureau received, wrongdoing was confirmed in 13 cases.   Pro-Beijing politicians including former city leader Leung Chun-ying have repeatedly criticised Yeung over the handling of protest-related incidents, while earlier this month Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor asked the bureau to seriously follow up cases of teachers’ misconduct.  Michael Wong Wai-yu, honorary executive secretary of the school heads’ association, said that while violence and hate speech from teachers were inappropriate and should be followed up, the bureau should provide more guidelines and put its trust in principals. “Whether a principal is fit for the job should be viewed from the perspective of education professionalism. But now there is a political perspective, which could give principals the feeling that if they support the government, then they are up to their job – which should not be the case,” Wong said.

Tang Shiu Kin Secondary School and head of the Wan Chai District Headmasters’ Conference, said Yeung’s comments could put further pressure on principals, who sometimes had limited power to look into each case because doing so could be considered an invasion of a teacher’s privacy. “If someone complains about a teacher’s comments on his or her private Facebook or Instagram account, how do principals confirm them to be true? For one, many people do not even use their real names on social media now,” Tai said.   Another head teacher from an aided secondary school, who asked not to be named, said Yeung’s remarks might spread fear among principals. He said in previous scandals the bureau did not exercise its power to remove the principal but instead only appointed people to the school’s management committee. Education sector lawmaker Ip Kin-yuen, vice-president of the pro-democracy Professional Teachers’ Union, accused Yeung of spreading “white terror” by threatening principals who did not adhere strictly to the government’s line. Wong Kwan-yu, president of the pro-Beijing Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers, said Yeung’s comments were not “entirely inappropriate” amid a divided society, but he believed the bureau would only remove a principal “as a last resort”. In a statement, the bureau dismissed claims of white terror, saying it had a responsibility to follow up on cases of teachers’ misconduct. It added that although it believed principals and school management had the ability to handle these cases well, it could exercise its powers in individual cases to protect students’ safety. It said while the permanent secretary had the power to withdraw a principal’s appointment approval, such power had not been exercised over the past five years. 	SCMP

Chan Chun-hin was brought to Fanling Magistrates’ Court two days after he was apprehended at Landmark North shopping centre in Sheung Shui, where protesters gathered to demonstrate against parallel traders and shoppers from mainland China in the bordering district. He faced one count of assaulting a police officer, who was identified as X in the court, and one count of resisting another officer, Y, at a bridge outside the mall. He was also charged with robbery for snatching an officer’s gun. It is alleged that Chan hit X in the chest three times on Saturday, prompting X and Y to give chase. He then fled inside the mall and during the ensuing struggle, allegedly grabbed Y’s shotgun and pulled its trigger three times. Student arrested for possessing explosives on Christmas Eve denied bail 26 Dec 2019 Student arrested for possessing explosives on Christmas Eve denied bail 26 Dec 2019 Chan was not required to make a plea, as acting principal magistrate Don So Man-lung adjourned the case until March 23 next year for police investigation. Prosecutors said police would conduct forensic examination on the blood found at the scene, check his mobile phone and inspect video footage.  His lawyer applied for bail on his behalf, which was turned down. At Kwun Tong Magistrates’ Court, four other students aged 14 to 2 were charged on Monday over an anti-government protest at Telford Plaza in Kowloon Bay on the same day.  Yim Cheuk-kin, 14, Yeung Kit-long, 20, and Mak Tsz-hei, 16, faced one joint count of assaulting a police sergeant, while Jeff Yau Chak, 16, was charged with assaulting a police constable.

In another case on Monday, health care assistant Ng King-sum had his charge dropped at Eastern Magistrates’ Court after prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence. He was arrested in Wan Chai on November 2 with a spanner and a hexagonal key and was charged with possessing an instrument fit for unlawful purposes. 	SCMP

Post The deployment was revealed as the organiser of a march on New Year’s Day called on people to join and show solidarity, while accusing the government of taking revenge against those who supported the protests. Insiders said police would take decisive and early action to prevent radicals from gathering in malls, vandalising shops and disrupting diners and restaurants. One police source said “we will act vigilantly”, in response to an online post calling for shops along the march’s route – from Victoria Park in Causeway Bay to Chater Road in Central – to be targeted. Hong Kong 2019 Year in Review Hong Kong 2019 Year in Review In a video posted to the force’s Facebook page, Commissioner of Police Chris Tang Ping-keung said: “If you use violence, you will not get public support. We, the police, will do all we can to arrest you. We will step up our efforts and citizens should refrain from breaking the law. “Don’t condone or cover up violence. In the coming year, we will face many challenges. But we are not alone. Many Hong Kong people support us. Many organisations support us too. Please stand with us.”  As of last Friday, police had arrested 6,494 people for various offences during almost seven months of civil unrest, sparked by opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed the transfer of suspects to stand trial in mainland China, among other jurisdictions. Demonstrations have repeatedly ended in clashes between protesters and police. Nearly 2,000 of those arrested are aged between 11 and 19, while more than 2,500 are students.  “Some incite hatred out of self-interest. They incite people, especially the young, to use violence and to vandalise shops,” Tang said.  Many lawbreakers and their supporters want to jeopardise the police’s operational efficiency by spreading fake news and misinformation to cause division between the force and the public, he added. Protesters plan New Year's Day rally after Christmas clashes Protesters plan New Year's Day rally after Christmas clashes Meanwhile, messages emerged on social media calling for rallies on New Year’s Eve that would take place in shopping malls – including Times Square in Causeway Bay, and Elements and Harbour City in Tsim Sha Tsui – before moving on to the harbourfront, West Kowloon, Lan Kwai Fong and the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai. There were also calls to form human chains near major MTR stations across the city, as well as a rally outside Prince Edward station to mark four months since police officers went onto platforms and trains to make arrests and were accused of using excessive force. “Plain-clothes officers posing as shoppers will carry out surveillance in shopping centres. Detectives will swoop into action when protesters start gathering,” one police source said. “Riot police will be called in if they refuse to disperse or leave.” He said police would take a tougher approach than the operation over Christmas. Happy New Year from Hong Kong – and bah humbug! Happy New Year from Hong Kong – and bah humbug! Unlike previous years, the force had no plans to close roads in Tsim Sha Tsui unless traffic conditions changed. Kenneth Kwok Ka-chuen, the chief superintendent of the force’s public relations branch, conceded the decision was “flexible” depending on protests, which often emerged at short notice. On Hong Kong Island, police will start closing Lockhart Road and East Point Road in Causeway Bay at 4pm and streets near Central Pier and the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre at 9pm. The force will also close off roads in Lan Kwai Fong from 2pm. As revellers bring in the new year, police will deploy about 2,000 officers on Hong Kong Island and another 1,000 in Kowloon. The MTR will provide overnight railway service. On New Year’s Day, about 3,000 officers will be out in force, with the deployment of two water cannons when the march takes place in the afternoon.   In urging the public to take part in the New Year Rally, the Civil Human Rights Front convenor, Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, accused the government of spreading white terror in the education sector by threatening to suspend or fire teachers and principals who supported the protests. “The government has started to take revenge. Their first target is the education sector,” he said, adding that the march would also protest against pay rises for police officers. The front disassociated itself from the poster calling for shops to be vandalised along the march route and said it had only been shared in pro-government groups. During the front’s last march on December 8, the group estimated a turnout of about 800,000 people, while police put the peak figure at 183,000. 	SCMP

It took place on Friday, but details and video footage of the exercise were not released until Sunday, via the garrison’s official social media accounts and state broadcaster CCTV. “The patrol was a joint operation between the ground force, navy and air force focusing on emergency action, troop movements, joint operations and simulated confrontations in accordance with a coherent strategy for actual combat,” the CCTV report said. People’s Liberation Army personnel from different units had also worked together to “seize and control a wharf” in a simulated operation, according to the report.

Beijing officials earlier said Hong Kong was “sliding into the abyss of terrorism”, and its fears would have worsened after police seized weapons including a handgun earlier this month, according to Song. seized weapons including a handgun He said Beijing was also angered by the US enacting legislation in support of the protesters. US enacting legislation “Beijing couldn’t tolerate the US intervention or the possibility of a terrorist attack happening in Hong Kong,” said Song, a military affairs commentator for Phoenix TV. “The Hong Kong garrison’s two missions are counterterrorism and defending the country’s territorial integrity, that’s why the troops have been very clearly flexing their muscles.” A video of the joint exercise aired by CCTV on Sunday showed paratroopers jumping from Z-9 helicopters onto landing boats, equipped with new helmets and rifles. Ye Weibang, deputy captain of the corvette, told the broadcaster that the drill included joint search and rescue operations, escort and capture activities. “Compared with previous drills, this one was more challenging because it was longer and involved more troops, and it was closer to being like an actual combat situation,” Ye said. It was the second bout of sabre-rattling by the PLA’s Hong Kong garrison in a week. On Christmas Eve, the state broadcaster released a video of the garrison conducting live-fire drills, led by a Qinzhou warship, in the South China Sea. conducting live-fire drills Macau-based military observer Antony Wong Dong agreed that Friday’s exercise in the harbour was intended to intimidate radical protesters.

The “Grief of us” rally at Edinburgh Place in Central came on the heels of weekend protests in shopping centres across the city, which resulted in 34 arrests, including a 13-year-old, and ahead of a march by the Civil Human Rights Front on January 1, expected to draw huge crowds. The demonstrators started the rally at 5.30pm by observing two minutes of silence, while some participants brought white flowers, folded colourful paper doves and signed their names on a memorial board that bore the names of 26 people who, they believed, had died during police operations or killed themselves over the ongoing social unrest. The protesters continue to believe some people died during police operations even though the government has come out time and again to say no one had been killed in such actions. Officials attempt for sixth time to debunk rumours of deaths during police action 10 Sep 2019 Officials attempt for sixth time to debunk rumours of deaths during police action 10 Sep 2019 Among the names was that of University of Science and Technology student Chow Tsz-lok who suffered severe brain injury after a fall in a Tseung Kwan O car park in November. Police were conducting a crowd clearance operation nearby, with tear gas, and are still investigating the incident. On the rally stage, a speaker who went by the alias “After Tomorrow”, spoke about the hurt and loss felt by many.  “Police have hurt our bodies and minds since June, this is something we won’t forget. We organised the vigil not just to remember those who have passed away, but also the freedoms and democracy that have died in Hong Kong,” he said. Rally organiser “Ha Gao” told those present about the power of collective remembrance.  “Many of our comrades have laid down their limbs, lives, and freedoms to fight for Hong Kong’s freedoms and future. That’s why we are here today.” He said that 2019 was a year of helplessness, anger, and extreme sadness. “But just as people remember the June 4 massacre [in Tiananmen Square in 1989], we need to document this part of our history.”  Organisers said about 600 people attended the rally. Police estimated the turnout was 280 at the rally’s peak. Sparked by opposition to the now-withdrawn extradition bill, the protests have morphed into a wider anti-government movement, demanding, among other things, greater democracy and accountability of police. Hundreds gather in pouring rain and vow to continue anti-government movement 29 Dec 2019 Hundreds gather in pouring rain and vow to continue anti-government movement 29 Dec 2019 At the rally, IT worker Roger Mak said he regularly attended peaceful rallies and would also attend the one scheduled on January 1. “Peaceful protests can boost our spirits as many of our radical comrades have been arrested. I have joined an IT labour union to help organise protests in our sector to mount pressure on the government,” Mak, 35, said. Many unions – especially in professions such as civil service, banking, and social work – were set up recently to organise sector-wide protests. Form Five student Ben Chu, was one of the many young faces at the rally. The 17-year-old said he believed young people would form the backbone of the protests in 2020. “Many young people were arrested over the weekend and during Christmas because we did not have school and could come out on the streets. This is our future, and we will continue to fight for it,” he said. 	SCMP

West Kowloon Magistracy was told pupils Ho Chi-ching and Kwok Hiu-nam posted three placards on a bridge railing in Tsing Yi on August 5, a day of citywide strike action. The pair were the first to be summonsed over the unauthorised display of posters on government land in relation to the ongoing protests that erupted in June over the now-withdrawn extradition bill. ongoing protests extradition bill The maximum penalty for the offence is a HK$10,000 fine upon conviction. Senior Constable Lau Yick-pang said both pupils admitted the act during questioning. But Lau also admitted he forgot to note down in writing their confessions and the evidence seized from the pair in accordance with Police General Orders. He said he had been occupied by matters including the handling of exhibits, jotting down events before the incident and applying for a summons. “I forgot to write them down for an instant. I couldn’t remember that many details.”  Nonetheless, Special Magistrate Lau Suk-han found the prosecution had established sufficient evidence and that the defendants, who were represented by lawyers and not required to attend the court hearing in person, had a case to answer. She will hear evidence from defence witnesses on January 14.  Prosecutor Francis Yip Kim-ming said the yellow posters, each measuring one metre by 0.4 metres, bore black Chinese characters that said “anti-extradition to China” and “strike, class boycott, trade suspension”.

I couldn’t remember that many details Lau Yick-pang, police officer After the police vehicle stopped at the roadside, he intercepted the pair who had walked down from the bridge. He said both defendants admitted affixing the posters to “voice out their demands”. A video played in court showed Lau and his colleague Jacky Lim Chi-leung carried out a body search on Ho under the bridge, but found nothing suspicious on him. Under cross-examination by defence lawyer Alex Lam Chi-yau, Lau said both defendants were affixing a poster to the railing when he drove past. In another version, however, Lau said he only saw the defendants taking hold of the poster without any apparent acts of affixing it. “All in all, the two handled and touched the posters,” he told the magistrate after some rounds of questioning. Lam accused the officer of failing to take notes of the body search, but Lau said it was not a formal one and did not require documentation. “We only did an ordinary and quick scan on him. We patted his pockets to see whether he had offensive weapons with him.” 	SCMP

A video showing two Mandarin-speaking women on the Hill of Crosses memorial near the city of Siauliai caught the attention of senior government officials. One woman was seen picking the cross up as the other encouraged her to “throw it away”. “[This] shameful, disgraceful act of vandalism is currently under investigation by Lithuanian authorities,” Linas Linkevicius, foreign minister of Lithuania, wrote on his official Twitter page on Sunday. “Such behaviour can’t and won’t be tolerated.” On Sunday, police officers who visited the site to assess the incident after examining videos and photos launched an inquiry, local media said. The dispute between supporters of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement and pro-government voices that prevail in mainland China has escalated to diplomatic levels in a number of countries, including Lithuania. Beijing had not publicly responded to the Lithuanian foreign ministry as of noon on Monday. Linkevicius made his statement while retweeting the video posted by an account called W.B. Yeats, whose Twitter biography claimed the user was a Hongkonger and supporter of the protests.  In the 28-seconds video, a woman was seen picking up a wooden cross planted in the ground which bore the messages “Hongkongers”, “Glory to Hong Kong”, and “Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times” – phrases chanted by demonstrators in support of the anti-government protests that have been going on for nearly seven months. ‘They want freedom the same way we wanted it’: Cheers and support in Lithuania as Hong Kong embraces the ‘Baltic Way’ 24 Aug 2019 ‘They want freedom the same way we wanted it’: Cheers and support in Lithuania as Hong Kong embraces the ‘Baltic Way’ 24 Aug 2019 “Just throw it away.

The woman who lifted the cross threw it into a cluster of other memorials and walked away, while the person filming the incident chuckled and said: “We have done something good today!

Calm down! To your left. Move towards your left,” the police officer shouted at the crowd. He was in a road littered with bricks, empty rubber bullet casings, abandoned trainers and busted umbrellas. Tear gas canisters rained down, creating chaos as the crowd of Hong Kong protesters tried to escape the suffocating clouds. This was near Polytechnic University during the most ferocious conflict in six months of protests that turned streets criss-crossing the city of glittering skyscrapers into no-go zones of burning barricades and wrecked subway stations. six months of protests The clashes between police and protesters had turned increasingly violent, but this police officer yelling at the crowd wasn’t in the ranks of those firing tear gas – he was right among the melee of black-clad protesters. A Hong Kong policeman's double life as a protest medic A Hong Kong policeman's double life as a protest medic And he was carrying an unconscious young man with a friend, a professional paramedic. Both were off-duty and had crossed the protest lines, driven, they said, by a desire to help those caught up in the violence. In an interview with the South China Morning Post, the officer showed his police badge and identification, but requested to be known by the pseudonym Eric to explain his activities. His companion requested the same, also showing his official ID and asking to be referred to as Peter. South China Morning Post  They explained that they switch into neon yellow vests, biker helmets and nylon surgical masks to work in the protest zones and use their professional training to assist the injured and traumatised. What became known as the Polytechnic University siege in November turned into a week-long stand-off between riot police and protesters boxed into the campus in Kowloon, across the harbour from Hong Kong Island. Polytechnic University siege  For most nights that week, both men said they would finish work, change clothes, and head to the streets surrounding the campus; helping those injured and dodging tear gas canisters fired by police on the other side. In describing the most chaotic night, Peter said: “Riot police were shooting non-stop from a footbridge above. Tear gas canisters were flying over our heads. We were carrying an unconscious young man who had been hit by a tear gas shell and there was nowhere to hide, even alleyways were filled with tear gas.”  Eric said he needed to use an asthma inhaler that evening after getting face-fulls of the gas. “I just want to help people like a real policeman is supposed to do, but I can’t do that now with my uniform on,” said Eric as he struggled to explain the emotional conflict he found himself in. “But when I am a volunteer medic, I can at least go out and tell Hong Kong people: ‘Don’t worry, I’m here to help. There’s no need to panic’,” he said. Subway attacks While the protests began as rallies against a bill that would have allowed extradition of suspects to mainland China, they turned into broader anti-government demonstrations. But Eric and Peter said it was a specific incident that prompted their volunteer work among protesters.   On July 21, protesters vandalised the front of Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong, pelting it with eggs and defacing the building with black spray paint and offensive graffiti. This infuriated pro-Beijing supporters as it left China’s national emblem outside the office splattered with black paintballs. The same evening a gang of as many as 100 men with steel bars and clubs assaulted members of the public at Yuen Long subway station. They are thought to have targeted protesters returning from the city after the attack on the liaison office. assaulted members of the public But film footage taken at Yuen Long also shows two uniformed police officers walking away from the scene as the subway attacks took place. This incident became a turning point for the already deteriorating police-community relations. Eric and Peter said the Yuen Long attacks, which were widely broadcast on social media, convinced them to take up their off-duty work, even at the risk of being identified or arrested by the police at protests. “After seeing my two colleagues turning their backs on citizens in need, I really couldn’t just sit by,” Eric said. “It’s a police officer’s duty to protect the citizens and enforce the law.”   The Hong Kong Police Force said it would not comment on individual cases when asked if such work by off-duty police officers violated any protocols. “In general, all members of the force, including on-duty and off-duty officers, have an obligation to uphold the force’s professional and positive image in order to maintain public confidence,” the public relations branch of the Force said in an emailed response. “Any police officer’s action or conduct which brings the force into disrepute, or is in breach of the Police (Discipline) Regulations or internal orders of the force, may result in disciplinary review,” said the email, which was attributed to the duty officer and didn’t provide a name. Anti-government protesters versus the police: understanding the psychology of hate 18 Aug 2019 Anti-government protesters versus the police: understanding the psychology of hate 18 Aug 2019 The July 21 attacks marked a shift in public discontent with the force and preceded a sharp rise in violence, as well as online threats against police officers and their families. Use of petrol bombs and vandalism increased, leading to more forceful responses by the authorities. And so the spiral of violence fed on itself. Police officers attacked in demonstrations drew their firearms, with the first warning shot fired on August 26. In subsequent conflicts, three protesters were shot and injured by live rounds, a police officer was admitted to hospital after being slashed in the neck by a box cutter, and another officer was shot through the leg by an arrow. When questioned about the violence against his fellow police officers, Eric said the protests began as demonstrations against the government and its policies, not the Hong Kong Police Force. He argues that the police have become a political tool and this has led to violation of Police General Orders that govern officers’ conduct, which in turn has fed the violence and brought the force into disrepute. He cited the case on November 11 when in a confrontation with demonstrators, a station sergeant fired three live rounds, one of which hit a protester. Eric said in his opinion the circumstances of the firing of the weapon violated Police General Orders, yet no action was taken. “I think it’s understandable that the protesters escalate their use of force against the police because in the past few months, the officers oftentimes didn’t follow the Police General Orders and continue to escalate their use of force,” he said. Amnesty International in September criticised Hong Kong’s police for what it called “retaliatory violence” against arrested protesters and cited specific complaints. criticised Hong Kong’s police The police responded at the time that anyone with a complaint against treatment in custody could file through official channels and said it did not comment on individual cases. Eric and Peter said they planned to continue with their volunteer work despite the risks. And that’s not just the threat of violence but also to their careers. A number of civil and public servants arrested at protests have reportedly been suspended. “At one point in my first trip out in the field, a police officer in anti-riot gear glared at me. Thankfully we didn’t know each other but that was my first encounter with such hostility from one of our own men,” Eric said. The pair said they travel light, carrying about 10 kilograms of basic first-aid gear each, to keep a low profile and move quickly with crowds– unlike official first-aid teams who move in groups and carry heavy equipment for dealing with medical emergencies. –   Initially, Eric and Peter said they didn’t use masks and helmets, but changed strategy. “We thought long about this because of our identities. It’s not just a matter of personal safety and career concern but our families’ livelihoods if we ended up losing our jobs for it,” Peter said. “So we pack light and try to avoid the front line to minimise the chance of arrest. “We thought long about this because of our identities. It’s not just a matter of personal safety and career concern but our families’ livelihoods if we ended up losing our jobs for it,” Peter said. “As first-aid volunteers we are limited in what we can do out of uniform. As a volunteer, I can’t handle severe levels of trauma,” he said. Whether in uniform or out of uniform, Peter said he identified with the people he met at protests as Hong Kong citizens first, just like him. “When I saw that university students were willing to fight for Hong Kong’s future, I couldn’t just sit by and watch,” he said. Uniform abuse Eric said his volunteer work created inevitable tensions at his day job. Though he’s not assigned to the 5,000-member Tide Riders police operation at the front line of protests, he is tasked with providing backup. He said he estimated about 20 per cent of his colleagues had shown some understanding towards Hong Kong’s young protesters, but most on the force saw them as rioters, backed by the US. “So I mostly just keep my mouth shut at work. I often go through a shift without speaking more than 10 sentences to my colleagues – we just have nothing much to say to each other,” Eric said. Then he gets abuse on the streets. “I tend to just look away and avoid eye contact when people give me verbal abuse when I’m in uniform,” he said, adding that in his view the hostility from the public reflected missed opportunities to improve relations. “If the fallout from the July 21 attacks had been handled better, things wouldn’t have evolved to this point today,” Eric said. “The only option for the government now is to set up an independent commission of inquiry into police activities during the protests and make all accountable under the law,” he said. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has rejected the idea of an independent commission, which is now one of the protesters’ core demands. Beijing has also been unequivocal in backing Hong Kong police, saying stopping violence and restoring order are the paramount priorities for the city. Hong Kong’s new police chief Chris Tang Ping-keung has said the same, stressing that he would only support the ongoing investigation by the force’s watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Council or IPCC. The credibility of that investigation took a knock on December 11 when international experts advising the body said they were withdrawing. That was a month after they said the IPCC lacked the necessary authority to conduct a full investigation. said they were withdrawing Eric said that while trust in the police force may be at a low, that’s not the full picture. “I want Hong Kong people to know there are good police officers out there,” Eric said. “They really want to do their best to serve and protect citizens.” Purchase the China AI Report 2020 brought to you by SCMP Research and enjoy a 20% discount (original price US$400).

207	https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3043880/taiwan-president-tsai-ing-wen-says-talks-beijing-could-resume	2019-12-30	Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen says talks with Beijing could resume	Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen has warned the island’s voters democracy was at risk from Beijing, but said she believed there was a chance of cross-strait reconciliation in the foreseeable future, without elaborating on how that would occur. Tsai Ing-wen “As long as we can forge internal unity to jointly face the current situation across the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and to demonstrate our resolution to uphold our national sovereignty while seeking to maintain cross-strait peace and stability, I believe Beijing authorities will have to deal with Taiwan eventually,” Tsai said. Speaking on Sunday during a televised debate between the three presidential candidates in January’s election, Tsai stopped short of saying how she would forge internal unity, given the sharp political divide between her pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the mainland-friendly camps which have troubled the island for decades. Cross-strait relations dominated the debate as Tsai exchanged fire with populist Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu, from the mainland-friendly Kuomintang (KMT) and James Soong Chu-yu, chairman of the smaller People First Party (PFP). Han Kuo-yu James Soong Chu-yu Tsai Ing-wen says Taiwan faces ‘threat’ from Beijing ahead of presidential election Tsai Ing-wen says Taiwan faces ‘threat’ from Beijing ahead of presidential election She accused Han, seen as Beijing’s most favoured candidate, of failing to uphold Taiwan’s sovereignty when it came to the question of whether he accepted the “one country, two systems” model being applied in Hong Kong and Macau. “Perhaps you say you reject it now, but it is all because you are under intense pressure to say so,” Tsai said. In response, Han said he also thought there was no need for Taiwan to listen to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s proposal on “one country, two systems,” adding Tsai had been using that anti-mainland tactic to try to canvass voters’ support and smear him for kowtowing to Beijing.  Soong said it was necessary for the two sides to create some form of constructive dialogue so they could better understand each other and avoid confrontation in the future. Official cross-strait exchanges have been suspended since 2016 when Tsai took office and refused to accept the one-China principle. Beijing, which considers Taiwan a wayward province to be returned to mainland control, by force if necessary, has continued to apply pressure on the Tsai administration – through war games, the poaching of seven diplomatic allies and blocks on visits to Taiwan by mainland tourists. Xi proposed in January 2019 that unification talks should begin based on the principle of one country, two systems which applies in Hong Kong and Macau. Xi proposed in January 2019 Tsai read excerpts from a letter she had received from a young person in Hong Kong who said Taiwan people were seeing “the end” of the city, which has been racked by anti-government protests for more than six months. anti-government protests  “‘I ask that Taiwan’s people not believe the Chinese Communists, don’t believe any pro-Communist official, and don’t fall into China’s money trap,” she read.  Tsai said she had remained non-provocative and had done all she could to continue normal exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, only to be snubbed by Beijing. “But what is more important at the moment is for us to uphold and safeguard our sovereignty, especially after Xi Jinping proposed earlier this year one country, two systems” as a formula for cross-strait unification talks. To Taiwanese people, safeguarding our sovereignty and preventing Taiwan from being annexed is very important and also the first priority,” she said. Battle for hearts and minds of young voters may prove crucial in Taiwan 10 Jan 2020 Battle for hearts and minds of young voters may prove crucial in Taiwan 10 Jan 2020 The debate, just two weeks ahead of the presidential election on January 11, followed three televised presentations by the candidates since December 18. Other issues covered during the debate included the island’s energy problem, corruption, labour policy and political issues. What does ‘one country, two systems’ mean? What does ‘one country, two systems’ mean? Analysts said, while the televised events would allow voters to understand what the candidates could do if elected, none of the candidates was able to offer any concrete solutions to the cross-strait stalemate. “On the cross-strait issue, the comments by the three candidates were quite superficial, just like when President Tsai repeatedly said she would safeguard sovereignty, she, however, stopped short of mentioning how she was able to maintain cross-strait exchanges while seeking to explore Taiwan’s diplomatic space,” said Chao Chun-shan, honorary professor of mainland studies at Tamkang University in Taipei. Wang Chih-sheng, secretary general of the Cross-Strait Policy Association, a private research agency in Taipei, said the debate had lacked substance, with all three candidates evasive on certain issues. He also said “the effect of Tsai’s anti-China card to trigger voters’ resentment toward Beijing and raise their fears over a possible taking of Taiwan by China has become weakened over time as Tsai has played the card too often this year”.

Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, an executive councillor, disclosed the move for the first time on Sunday as demonstrations continue into their seventh month, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. demonstrations extradition bill The movement has morphed into a wider campaign for more democracy and an independent inquiry into police’s handling of protests, marking Hong Kong’s biggest social unrest since its 1997 return to Chinese rule. “An executive councillor had [informally] told Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor that we did not mind tabling a collective resignation, if it helped the situation,” Ip said in a television interview. “But the chief executive said we were on the periphery, merely giving advice … meaning if anyone should have to be held accountable, Executive Council members would not be the first.” Executive Council Exco runs under the principles of collective responsibility and confidentiality, serving as an advisory body for the city’s leader.  The Chief Executive’s Office said it had no comment on Sunday evening.   In response to a follow-up query by the Post, Ip said the idea of collective resignation was only “an academic discussion among ourselves”, referring to some of the councillors. Post  Two members the Post contacted did not deny that the discussion took place. Post Ip, speaking in the earlier television interview, said the government might consider if a ministerial reshuffle would help resolve the crisis, adding “this may not only hold them accountable, but also alleviate public anger”. Thousands gather in rain for peaceful anti-government rally in downtown Hong Kong Thousands gather in rain for peaceful anti-government rally in downtown Hong Kong “From the government’s perspective, the issue to consider when letting ministers resign, or asking them to step down, is about finding suitable replacements,” she said. Ip, who resigned as secretary for security in 2003 after a proposed national security law sparked massive protests, also said she felt tricked by the government’s U-turn in June over the suspension of the extradition bill. The reviled legislation would have allowed for the transfer of fugitives to jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no such agreement, including mainland China. After a massive march on June 9 and confrontations between protesters and police outside the legislature on June 12, Ip said she had made a call to the administration and was told authorities would not back down. Yet on June 15, soon after Lam called for a meeting with Exco members to explain her change of heart, the decision to suspend the bill was made. On September 4, Lam announced the official withdrawal of the bill. “I knew I was tricked,” Ip said of the incident. Political commentator Johnny Lau Yui-siu, however, said collective resignation by Exco members would not quell public anger. Hundreds gather in pouring rain and vow to continue Hong Kong protests 29 Dec 2019 Hundreds gather in pouring rain and vow to continue Hong Kong protests 29 Dec 2019 “It will absolutely not help. It might help a little if Lam resigns because, as she has already made clear, Exco members are only peripheral. She was telling the truth,” Lau said. He added that Lam’s description of the cabinet implied she was saying members had no real power in policymaking. Lau said the composition of Exco also showed “no political alliance” between different groups, as members were all considered part of the pro-establishment bloc.   Separately, in an interview on Saturday with online news outfit Shanghai Observer about the ongoing social unrest, Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung said the government had the power to disqualify school principals and teachers deemed to be unsuitable for their positions over how they handled protest-related matters. “All principals are appointed by the permanent secretary for education, and so we have the legal power [to disqualify them]. But we will be very cautious in exercising this,” Yeung said. Yeung added that two public school teachers had been transferred to the Education Bureau’s office after allegations of inappropriate online comments. The bureau would decide on further action on the pair after an investigation was completed, he said. Earlier this month, Yeung revealed that about 80 teachers had been arrested over their involvement in the protests, while at least four had resigned or were suspended. The bureau received 123 complaints of protest-related misconduct against teachers between mid-June and late November. Education sector lawmaker Ip Kin-yuen said Yeung’s remarks amounted to “white terror”, as the minister was pressuring schools to align themselves with the government’s political stance. Top officials promise raft of measures in new year and budget 29 Dec 2019 Top officials promise raft of measures in new year and budget 29 Dec 2019 Ip said normally only school boards could fire principals and teachers. The “school-based management” system, which provided flexibility to operate, would be destroyed if the bureau got too involved, he said. Tai Tak-ching, head of the Wan Chai District Headmasters’ Conference, believed Yeung’s comments had left school heads in a difficult position. He said although he agreed that hate speech or provocative acts on social media were inappropriate for teachers, principals sometimes had limited power to look into each case as some comments might be private.

Four months on, Li has conducted four such sharing sessions, inviting not only teachers, students, but also barristers, journalists, and social workers who helped at protests. And now he is planning to ask police officers to join next month’s talk. “I don’t expect to change a person’s view 180 degrees through a single sharing session,” he said. “Maybe some teachers have negative thoughts about police, and maybe some police officers have negative views about the education sector. But, it’s important to start a conversation as a first step.” The Kwai Chung secondary school head believes that in the face of serious mistrust between different members of society, it is important to find common ground through a genuine exchange of views. “Conversation is always better than confrontation, although it may not mend all hatred in a heartbeat,” he said.  “Let’s not focus too much on the differences we have but try to remind ourselves of what we do share in common. We are all Hongkongers who want the best for our city.” Li said the sharing, which aimed to encourage teachers to listen to voices from across the political spectrum, and provide peer support to the educators, all started when he met one of his Form Six graduates who had taken part in protests triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. Peaceful protesters just as guilty as violent radicals, says Hong Kong police union chief 28 Dec 2019 Peaceful protesters just as guilty as violent radicals, says Hong Kong police union chief 28 Dec 2019 The protests, which started in early June, have morphed into wider and increasingly violent anti-government movement in which more than 6,000 people have been arrested so far, nearly 40 per cent of them are students.  “He [the Form Six graduate] had really experienced a lot this summer. And after listening to his sharing I felt uneasy and so I asked, ‘what can I as your principal do?’,"" Li said.  “The student told me that young people hoped adults would not only focus on what they did, but also look deeper into their rationale and thinking behind it. Even though some might not agree with their cause, they just want someone to listen to them.”  Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Hong Kong police chase down protesters trying to escape from Polytechnic University Nine students, including radical and peaceful protesters, as well as some who “did not entirely agree with the protests”, were invited to share their views in person at the venue or through video call, while more than 50 teachers and principals from different schools attended. During the 90-minute session, teachers also got to ask questions or provide feedback after hearing from guests who felt they could speak freely behind closed doors. “Some teachers were touched and some even wept after listening to [what the young people] had to say,” Li said. “I did not ask them why, but I also got teachers’ feedback thanking me for organising these sessions so they can understand more about young people. “As education workers, we do have a need to hear different voices.” One of the participants, secondary school teacher Tommy Chow Tsz-yan, agreed. He said after attending the first sharing session in September, he came to realise he should not jump to conclusions too quickly in classrooms. Hong Kong school week kicks off with citywide student protests against anti-mask law arrests 8 Oct 2019 Hong Kong school week kicks off with citywide student protests against anti-mask law arrests 8 Oct 2019 “Students don’t like us giving them many instructions before we listen to what they really think. They would not listen to us this way,” he said. Other guest speakers included journalists, social workers as well as emergency doctors who had treated injured protesters. The most sought-after session involved a barrister who shared his views on the controversial mask ban law, which more than 160 people attended. Also a vice-president of the Hong Kong Association for School Discipline and Counselling Teachers, Li said he had noticed that teachers have felt more stress than ever, as they faced pressure from inside and outside school. He said teachers and principals were often challenged by parents and sometimes outsiders over their political views, while they also had to handle students’ emotions. He hoped that through the sharing sessions, teachers could show support to each other, while some volunteer education psychologists and counsellors were also put on standby in case teachers were in need of immediate emotional support. Li was also among the more than 100 principals, teachers and social workers who entered Polytechnic University during a 13-day police siege last month, where they eventually persuaded more than 300 minors to leave the site. Police declared the unrest at PolyU a riot and surrounded the campus on November 17 after protesters blocked roads and set fires nearby which led to violent clashes. More than 1,000 hard-core protesters and their supporters were inside during the siege. "	SCMP

The organiser estimated about 4,000 people attended the authorised rally in Central, while police put the turnout at 500 at its peak. The assembly took place ahead of a march by Civil Human Rights Front on New Year’s Day to press the government to meet the core demands of protesters. The front, an umbrella organisation of pro-democracy groups that has arranged some of the campaign’s key protests, received a letter of no objection from police on Sunday for the march from Victoria Park in Causeway Bay to Chater Road in Central. Police said they reserved the right to end the march if public order was threatened. In its application, the front estimated at least 32,000 people would attend. Thousands gather in rain for peaceful anti-government rally in downtown Hong Kong Thousands gather in rain for peaceful anti-government rally in downtown Hong Kong On Sunday, the usual chants of “five demands, not one less”, “disband Hong Kong police” and “Hongkongers, revenge!” were once again loudly heard in Central, as protesters attended the assembly at Edinburgh Place. They also rolled out a giant black banner that marked the key events in the first six months of protests, which were triggered in June by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. extradition bill  An eight-year-old, who gave her name as Hailey, wrote on the banner: “Hongkongers revenge, Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.” Hailey and her mother said they had attended mass demonstrations together since June 9, when an estimated 1 million protesters took to the streets against Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s controversial bill. “She knows a lot about the protests because of news live-streaming,” Hailey’s mother said. “Unless she has to do homework or study for exams, we have joined peaceful protests to support the anti-government movement.”  Mandy Cheung, who has helped provide supplies such as masks and food to protesters since June, said she was worried some pro-democracy supporters felt they had gained an early triumph in the district council elections last month. Pro-democracy candidates swept the board, taking control of all but one of the city’s 18 district councils.  “There are relatively fewer people who come and donate supplies, maybe some feel we have won a battle in the election and do not need to come forward again,” she said. Peaceful protesters just as guilty as violent radicals, says Hong Kong police union chief 28 Dec 2019 Peaceful protesters just as guilty as violent radicals, says Hong Kong police union chief 28 Dec 2019 Cheung though was as determined as ever and quit her job in the advertising industry to join the movement full time. “We will carry on our role until the five demands are met,” she said. A 68-year-old retired construction worker, who gave his surname as Chow, said he fled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou in the 1970s, and believed Hongkongers would never accept tyranny and the suppression of their freedoms. “Hong Kong was able to develop a strong and stable economy because it adopted Western values [like a free economy and human rights],” he said. Supporters of the movement took turns to address the crowds, while the organisers played a recorded message from a man they did not identify, who claimed he had been arrested, and had fled the city. Claiming he was beaten by police before receiving treatment in hospital, the 19-year-old urged Hongkongers to fight on. “I wish to come back but sadly I cannot,” he said. “I really miss all of you a lot, missing Hong Kong a lot. Hongkongers, can you work a bit more? All of you can start by supporting ‘yellow shops’ and joining authorised peaceful rallies like this one.” The crowd also urged people to join the front’s January 1 march, telling each other: “See you in Victoria Park.” The protesters’ core demands include an independent inquiry in police actions during the unrest and reforms leading to universal suffrage. Meanwhile, it was back to business as usual in the border town of Sheung Shui, a day after at least 15 people were arrested in a protest attended by about 300 against so-called parallel traders and shoppers from mainland China. A mother surnamed Zhou, 30, a resident of Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong, said she was in Sheung Shui to buy milk powder and diapers for her eight-month-old baby. She said she had not heard about the trouble on Saturday but would leave “as soon as possible”. “I am a bit afraid. Some security guards have been asking mainlanders to leave quickly after buying things,” she said. A woman, surnamed Liu, 33, who carried a suitcase with milk powder and snacks, also said she was not aware of the protest but was not deterred from coming to Hong Kong. “I usually come to Hong Kong twice a month, sometimes three times … Of course, protests will affect shoppers’ mood, but goods in Hong Kong are still cheaper,” she said. At 2.30pm, many mainland shoppers with suitcases were seen at Sheung Shui MTR station on their way home – heading back before 3pm, the time the protest started on Saturday. Dozens of riot police were seen on footbridges in the town. A 12-year-old boy was stopped and searched by riot police officers at about 3.15pm and later let go. An employee, surnamed Wong, at an outdoor products store in Landmark North, the shopping centre that protesters targeted on Saturday, said although business in December had slightly improved compared to recent months, overall sales had dropped by more than 20 per cent year on year. “If the general atmosphere, including social issues, protests and other factors, do not change, sales are expected to further drop next year, especially after the Lunar New Year,” she said.

In a blog post, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said he expected negative growth in the fourth quarter this year, noting gloomy figures in retail sales, visitor arrivals and unemployment rates in certain industries. “Although the statistics for the fourth quarter will be out only early next year, judging from the situation in the past months, continued negative growth is unavoidable,” Chan wrote. Two other top officials, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung and Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau Tang-wah separately shared similar sentiments on Sunday while reviewing the impact of the ongoing political crisis. Hong Kong has been rocked by anti-government protests since June, which, coupled with the US-China trade war, have pushed the city into a recession. The economy shrank 3.2 per cent in the third quarter from the previous one, while GDP was down 2.9 per cent year on year, the biggest contraction in a decade. Hong Kong slips into recession as economy shrinks 3.2 per cent in the third quarter 31 Oct 2019 Hong Kong slips into recession as economy shrinks 3.2 per cent in the third quarter 31 Oct 2019 Chan cited the record drop of 26 per cent in retail sales in October, the more than 50 per cent plunge in the number of visitors to Hong Kong during the Christmas holidays, and the unemployment rate of more than 6 per cent in the catering industry, a six-year high.  “This will leave the government with its first budget deficit in the past 15 years. It means the government’s flexibility in deploying financial resources during the economic downturn will be less,” he said. The government’s flexibility in deploying financial resources during the economic downturn will be less Paul Chan, financial secretary To ease the pressure on the public and small and medium-sized enterprises, the finance chief said the theme of the coming budget address in February would be on “supporting enterprises, safeguarding jobs, revitalising the economy and easing poverty”. Cheung, Hong Kong’s No 2 official, also said in a blog post that the economy was expected to shrink by 1.3 per cent this year, the first time in a decade, while warning of “tough tests and challenges in 2020”. The chief secretary said the government would try its best to handle the political storm, uphold the rule of law and mend fractures in society in the coming year.  “Hong Kong has a deep foundation and competitive system. If it can grasp opportunities, stop the violence and restore social order as soon as possible, it can surely be back on the right track for rebirth,” he wrote. ‘Violence, hatred pushing city to brink of worst recession since 1997 handover’ 17 Nov 2019 ‘Violence, hatred pushing city to brink of worst recession since 1997 handover’ 17 Nov 2019 Cheung added that the government was preparing to set up an independent review committee to look into the cause and influence of the social unrest from a macro aspect, and solve deep-rooted conflicts for better policymaking.  He also noted that the Independent Police Complaints Council would submit its first-stage report to the city’s leader in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, under Yau, announced on Sunday that a dedicated service team called “SME ReachOut” will start work on January 1 to support small businesses through face-to-face meetings to help identify suitable funding schemes. Other schemes for SMEs would also be enhanced through measures such as raising funding ceilings and the ratio of initial payments “Enterprises are facing the challenges of the external economic environment and pressure from the downward trend of the current economy,” Yau said. “The measures to be launched will more effectively and flexibly support enterprises in expanding markets, while enhancing their competitiveness to help them capture new business opportunities.” Danny Lau Tat-pong, honorary chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association, welcomed the government’s new support measures, especially the service team for SMEs. “The government has some 40 funding projects for SMEs. Some are quite similar and the application procedures are very complicated,” he said. Lau also said he hoped the government could shorten the time in handling applications and funding distribution. He said his company with about 200 people had been waiting for five months for an approval for government funding of HK$500,000, while other SMEs had waited for more than a year. In early December, the government announced the fourth wave of relief measures worth about HK$4 billion, including a tax instalment plan and subsidies for small firms. They are on top of more than HK$21 billion in sweeteners unveiled over the past four months, including a raft of waivers on government fees for companies, fuel subsidies for the logistics industry, cash incentives for travel agents, as well as allowances for students and low-income groups. sweeteners unveiled over the past four months Sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, the protest movement has since morphed into a citywide anti-government campaign calling for more democracy and an independent inquiry into police action.

Leung, now a vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, mainland China’s top advisory body, put forward his controversial idea in a social media post on Sunday. “The government should ask the Audit Commission to fully look into RTHK’s books and see if it is value for money,” he wrote, referring to the public spending watchdog. “There are so many online media companies nowadays, and there are only 7.5 million Hong Kong people, and everyone has just 24 hours a day to peruse news, information or entertainment.” The post followed a plea for more funding from 26 members of the RTHK Programme Advisory Panel, who said it was unfair for the station to suffer job cuts in the face of an increased workload during the ongoing protests, while police could claim nearly HK$1 billion (US$128.2 million) in overtime pay. In a letter, the advisers appealed to Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau Tang-wah to increase resources for the broadcaster, and restart plans to build its new headquarters.  Earlier this month, the RTHK Programme Staff Union claimed the station had cut the jobs of its part-time employees and drivers. The union said it was difficult to estimate how many part-time employees had been cut, but confirmed about 30 per cent of drivers had lost their jobs. To Yiu-ming, a retired professor of the journalism department at Baptist University, said Leung’s remarks were unacceptable. Hong Kong government supporters’ protest targets ‘biased’ journalists at public broadcaster RTHK’s headquarters 24 Aug 2019 Hong Kong government supporters’ protest targets ‘biased’ journalists at public broadcaster RTHK’s headquarters 24 Aug 2019 “As Hong Kong has been polarised by the ongoing social movement over the past six months, we are very much in need of a public broadcaster which is free from political inclination,” said To, who suspected that Leung’s outburst was connected to dissatisfaction among the pro-Beijing camp with some of RTHK’s reporting on alleged police brutality.  Hong Kong Information Technology Federation honorary chairman Francis Fong Po-kiu, one of the 26 advisers who called for more resources, said the broadcaster had been doing a good job.  “The function of RTHK goes beyond reporting news, but also providing diverse programmes targeting ethnic minorities and centring on niche cultural topics that commercial broadcasters rarely touch on,” he said. RTHK management spokeswoman Amen Ng Man-yee said the broadcaster’s financing arrangements followed a mechanism set by the government. The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau earlier said RTHK always received enough funding to carry out its work. The bureau said it had nothing to add regarding Leung’s remarks. 	SCMP

West Kowloon Magistracy imposed the bail condition on Saturday on Wong Cheuk-yin, who was charged with one count of criminal damage over the incident at a Starbucks coffee shop in the Langham Place shopping centre in Mong Kok. Mugs and a display shelf were damaged. Anti-government protesters had marched through the mall, heckling diners at certain restaurants. In Hong Kong, Starbucks is operated by catering firm Maxim’s Group, a frequent target after its founder’s daughter Annie Wu Suk-ching criticised protesters. The court adjourned Wong’s case to January 24 and granted him cash bail of HK$5,000 (US$641) with a list of conditions, including a ban on entering any mall in the city other than the one in Lohas Park, where he lives. Wong was also banned from going to Sai Yee Street, Soy Street, Bute Street and Shanghai Street in Mong Kok. He was also placed under a curfew from midnight to 6am every day, barred from leaving Hong Kong, and must check in at Mong Kok Police Station every Monday between 8pm and 11pm.  Prosecutors said police still had to take statements from Starbucks employees and other witnesses, as well as obtain CCTV footage from each floor of Langham Place.

Wong had also held other odd jobs including as a plumber, construction worker and installing outdoor advertisements. Police arrested 336 people from Monday to Friday morning, 165 of them on Christmas Eve, including 105 near the force’s headquarters in Wan Chai, on suspicion of taking part in an illegal assembly.  Hong Kong has been gripped by protests since June, originally triggered by a now-withdrawn , later spiralling into a larger anti-government movement.

The industry has been hard hit by the protests that have rocked the city since early June, with hotel bookings for the Lunar New Year one month away halved from the same period last year, while smaller guest house operators said they had yet to receive any reservations. Yiu Siu-wing, the lawmaker representing the tourism sector, said it was still hard to say whether business for the industry would improve during the Lunar New Year holiday, which would begin on January 25. “With demonstrations taking place in shopping malls [during Christmas], many hotels said they would need to wait and see. Customers will not book hotel rooms that early,” Yiu said on Saturday. Over the Christmas holiday, radical protesters resorted to vandalism in their “shopping” rallies at malls across the city, prompting police to use tear gas and pepper spray to disperse them. Yiu told a radio programme that occupancy rates in hotels in recent months were not satisfactory.  He said some hotels that were located in protest-prone areas or that did not cut room rates drastically had occupancy rates of less than 50 per cent. Yiu added that overall hotel room rates had been cut by 50 per cent or more. Tourist arrivals in October take sharpest plunge since Hong Kong’s protests began 30 Nov 2019 Tourist arrivals in October take sharpest plunge since Hong Kong’s protests began 30 Nov 2019 Official figures showed that the number of visitors to Hong Kong began to register a year-on-year drop as early as July. In October, there were around 3.31 million visitors, 43.7 per cent less than the same period last year. The Tourism Board announced earlier this month year-on-year tourist figures had dropped 56 per cent in November.  Jason Wong Chun-tat, chairman of the Travel Industry Council, told the same programme daily number of tours coming from the mainland had dropped from up to 200 in the past to only around 10 to 20.    While there was still around a month to go until the holiday and more bookings were expected, Li said that in the past, around 20 to 30 per cent of hotel rooms would be pre-booked by this time. Hong Kong’s hotel sector is in free fall as violent protests keep tourists away 17 Sep 2019 Hong Kong’s hotel sector is in free fall as violent protests keep tourists away 17 Sep 2019 “We dare not be optimistic at all,” Li said. “Many major activities have been cancelled, what else is there to attract visitors?” While the traditional New Year’s Eve fireworks have been cancelled this year, the Lunar New Year parade – which was launched in 1996 – will also be replaced by a carnival for the first time. Li said a more accurate assessment of the hotel occupancy situation could be made around a week ahead of the holiday. He expected occupancy at three- and four-star hotels to be around 70 to 80 per cent during the Lunar New Year, down from 80 to 90 per cent over the same period in the past. In five-star hotels, he expected occupancy to be around 50 to 60 per cent at the most. Guest houses, which offer more modest accommodation, hope to see an improvement in business, though not much is expected. David Leung Tai-wai, founder-chairman of the Hong Kong Guest Houses Association, which represented more than 1,000 of some 3,000 guest houses in the city, said the average occupancy rate over Christmas was merely above 10 per cent. “We hope the situation will be slightly better over the Lunar New Year,” Leung said. “Hopefully the occupancy rate will improve to around 20 per cent.” No guest house bookings had yet been made for the holiday, he said. But he also said a more precise assessment of the situation could be made only around one to two weeks ahead of the Lunar New Year. He said a slight improvement in tourist arrivals was expected as the protests appeared to have become less intense lately. “What has been damaged in six months … will need at least a year to recover,” Leung said. He expected around 300 guest houses would close down after the Lunar New Year because of the dire situation created by the drop in tourist arrivals. 	SCMP

Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s message, which was posted on her Facebook page at noon on Saturday, drew mostly negative response. By 5.30pm, it attracted 8,300 users’ response – with 5,300 showing “anger”. In the post, Lam said she received many Christmas and New Year greeting cards from Hong Kong people recently. “I tried to read them all personally to listen to the people’s voice,” she wrote. “I will seriously reflect on people’s criticism, and actively follow up on their requests for assistance. I’m grateful to those who encouraged me and will convert their encouragement into the motivation behind my work.”  Attached to the post was a photo of about 10 Christmas cards she had received. The photo also showed a message a resident wrote to her. The writer identified herself as “Ms Law”, a Tai Wo Hau resident who takes care of a child with special education needs, and a recipient of the government’s working family allowance.  “Respectable Chief Executive Mrs Lam”, she wrote, “since you took office, I feel that you have never given up on grass roots residents, and have always cared for the underprivileged.”  Law also said she admired Lam’s talent, as the chief executive had “done things that no one did before”.

Law also said she hoped Lam would “overcome difficulties and stay healthy”. But many Facebook users were not impressed by the message. A user’s comment – “Five demands, not one less! Universal suffrage for the chief executive, restore us the real ‘one country, two systems’!” – was one of the most popular, and was liked by hundreds. There were also comments from her supporters, including one who asked when would she enact national security legislation. “The Hong Kong police are exhausted, please cheer them up personally,” another user wrote.

In the evening, trouble flared at the Telford Plaza shopping centre in Kowloon Bay, as dozens of protesters marched through the mall. Plain-clothes police subdued and arrested at least five people after protesters confronted officers. Earlier, in Sheung Shui, protesters showed up in the Landmark North shopping centre and on a footbridge from the mall to the MTR railway station, kicking shopping bags and suitcases of mainland visitors, who fled the scene, some leaving goods behind. Two women screamed “help!” and ran into the station, while a man was injured after scuffles with protesters, who said he took photos of them and tried to push his way through the crowd. The protests followed days of demonstrations and confrontations with police over Christmas, which led to more than 336 arrests from Monday to Friday morning. Protesters have also vowed to return to the streets for a mass rally on January 1 to ring in the new year. demonstrations and confrontations The protesters started to gather at 3pm on Saturday in Sheung Shui, heeding online calls to go “shopping” in Landmark North.  Anti-government protesters and localists have long railed against the influx of parallel traders – those who buy tax-free goods in Hong Kong in bulk and resell them on the mainland to turn a profit – and shoppers from across the border, which they said had led to crowded streets, a shortage of groceries and daily necessities and the deterioration of living standards in the community. Chanting slogans like “go back to the mainland”, “shop in China if you love the mainland”, as well as common anti-government rallying cries such as “five demands, not one less” and “disband the police force”, the protest had grown in numbers by 3.30pm as the group marched through the mall.  About 90 per cent of shops closed their shutters, some with customers still inside. Chan, a 20-year-old protester, was upset by changes he had seen in his hometown.  “I have lived in Sheung Shui all my life, and seen with my own eyes the complete transformation of the local community, which has been taken over by mainlanders,” he said. “I don’t mind causing some shops to lose business as they mostly serve goods popular with mainland customers.” Shortly after 4pm, dozens of riot police charged into the mall, rushing up to the fourth floor to pin down at least 15 protesters. About 45 minutes later, riot police on the ground floor fired pepper spray after protesters heckled them. In a Facebook post, police said they entered the mall because “masked rioters” were causing a nuisance and had thrown nails into shops. “Their acts disturbed public order. In the face of their illegal acts, riot police entered the mall for law enforcement,” the post said. During the clashes, 41-year-old blind lawyer Joy Luk, who frequently attends protests, said she was pushed to the ground by a policewoman. “She told me to walk backwards, knowing full well I can’t see anything,” Luk said. By 5.10pm, riot police had taken away at least 15 people and left the mall. About 100 protesters remained on the bridge outside, and scuffled occasionally with mainland shoppers, who had luggage kicked and goods such as biscuits and trainers scattered on the ground. Protesters plan New Year's Day rally after Christmas clashes Protesters plan New Year's Day rally after Christmas clashes A mainland shopper, who gave his name as Lam, said he had not been aware of protests in the area before he arrived. “I won’t come back again for shopping, as we are clearly not welcome,” he said. Local shopper Wong said she was not particularly bothered by the protests. “Look around you, you can see many elderly residents and local supporters joining in, wearing masks and shouting slogans, too. This tells you the groundswell and depth of anger in the local community, which has seen its local identity and culture changed beyond recognition in recent years.” Daisy Chan, a convenience store worker, said business was down about 20 per cent. “Protesters come and go, but their clashes with police and the subsequent lockdown of the mall actually hurt us more in terms of customers.” Over in Kowloon Bay, riot police rushed into the Telford Plaza mall at about 8pm, pushing people back and briefly raising a blue flag warning of an illegal assembly. Plain-clothes officers were later seen taking at least five people away, one of whom was bleeding from the face. A statement from the force said riot police had entered the mall after “masked rioters caused a nuisance and disturbed public peace … and assaulted police officers”. A torn mask and bloodstains were seen at the scene. Witnesses said the blood was from a young girl who had been arrested earlier. Secondary school pupil Jack, 17, took the bus to Telford Plaza at about 7pm after protesting in Sheung Shui. He said only about 30 protesters turned up at short notice, and they shouted at plain-clothes officers after discovering who they were. “Just like in Sheung Shui, there were no vandalism or damage of shops. Police are now openly clamping down on peaceful demonstrations,” he said. During the operation at Telford Plaza, plain-clothes officers wore orange armbands – those in Sheung Shui had worn pink ones – to identify themselves and to avoid mistakenly targeting their colleagues. Riot police wrongly intercepted a masked plain-clothes officer armed with a baton during a clearance operation outside Tai Po Mega Mall on Thursday. The detective was released after shouting “same team”. Meanwhile in Tin Shui Wai, hundreds gathered for a peaceful students’ rally themed “continue the revolution, do not forget your roots”. Speakers included pupils, student journalists, teachers and four newly elected Yuen Long district councillors. 	SCMP

In an open letter to his members, Lam Chi-wai, chairman of the Junior Police Officers' Association, said while radicals should be condemned for their violence, protesters who called themselves “wo lei fei”, a Cantonese phrase meaning “peaceful, reasonable and non-violent”, were just as culpable. wo lei fei “Rioters who are directly involved in the violence surely need to be responsible for their serious crimes, but a group of self-proclaimed peaceful, rational and non-violent followers cannot escape the blame,” Lam said. Lam pointed out that peaceful protesters were using their bodies, umbrellas and other items to cover up for radicals who were assaulting people or vandalising businesses, cheering for them, helping them escape, or encouraging others to break the law online. He added that some just stood and watched while radicals beat up people of different opinions, or damaged shops. “I urge the media and citizens to stop calling them ‘wo, lei, fei’,” he wrote. “Their act is as inhuman and cold-blooded as those violent rioters … they are blatant accomplices.” wo, lei, fei  Lam warned that those peaceful protesters could face legal consequences. “Your acts of assisting rioters to commit crime and escape, or obstructing police officers to execute duties are possibly unlawful,” Lam said. “One day you would need to bear criminal liability for what you have done.”  In the letter, Lam lashed out at radical protesters for their actions over the Christmas holidays, and accused them of attacking individual police officers to the extent they seemed to want to kill them. The city has been embroiled in protests since June, triggered by an unpopular extradition bill that was withdrawn in September, but the demonstrations have evolved into an increasingly violent wider anti-government campaign.  Over Christmas, masked protesters targeted shopping centres in tourist areas, chanting slogans and heckling customers outside shops with mainland China links. Riot police used tear gas and pepper spray to disperse crowds.

The ongoing political unrest has dominated the news in Hong Kong. Protesters and controversial figures at the centre of the movement, such as pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho Kwan-yiu, and city leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, are the most Googled public figures in Hong Kong. Apart from protests, Hong Kong actress Jacqueline Wong Sum-wing’s scandal with married singer Andy Hui Chi-on caught Hongkongers off guard in April, after a racy video showing the two in a compromising situation came to light. As the year draws to an end, Fiona Sun takes a look at the people in the news in Hong Kong this year. Hong Kong protesters Hong Kong protesters Hundreds of thousands of anti-government protesters have taken to the streets of Hong Kong over the past six months, initially opposing a controversial extradition bill, and evolving into greater civil unrest. The protest movement started with peaceful demonstrations that saw record turnouts, with more than 1 million people on June 9, and an estimated 2 million on June 16 marching peacefully to protest against the extradition bill.  The bill, if passed, would have allowed fugitives to be sent to jurisdictions with which the city had no agreement with, including mainland China. It was formally withdrawn in October. As the unrest has unfolded, protesters have made five demands – the withdrawal of the extradition bill, an independent inquiry into the police’s handling of the protests, amnesty for arrested protesters, a halt to describing the protests as riots, and the implementation of universal suffrage.  To force the government to respond, protesters have adopted various tactics, from peaceful demonstrations and disrupting traffic, to building bombs, and destroying MTR stations and businesses protesters accuse of being pro-Beijing.  Police have responded with pepper spray, tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and live rounds, and have arrested more than 6,100 people, aged 11 to 84, charging around 1,000. Despite successfully prompting the government to formally withdraw the bill on October 23 and the pro-democracy camp to win a landslide district council election on November 24, protesters vow to continue their fight for the remaining demands, with no clear end in sight. Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor is blamed by many for the ongoing social unrest – the biggest political crisis since the city was returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997. It was Lam’s determination to proceed with the extradition bill, which was sparked by the death of Poon Hiu-wing in Taiwan, reportedly at the hands of her boyfriend Chan Tong-kai, that turned largely peaceful protests into a violent anti-government movement. Fears over the potential for political persecution in mainland China, and the lack of a guarantee of fair trials, saw millions of people take to the streets in early June. Following clashes between protesters and police, Lam announced a suspension of the bill on June 15, but that failed to satisfy protesters who demanded its complete withdrawal. Increasingly violent clashes followed, but Lam did not give in until September 4, when she said the government would officially withdraw the bill in October. Rumours have regularly circulated that Lam would step down, although she and Beijing have denied it. In a leaked audio recording released on September 2, Lam said at a closed-door meeting that given the choice, she would quit, having caused “unforgivable havoc” in the city. She denied it the following day. Attempting to curb protests, Lam invoked the Emergency Regulations Ordinance on October 4 to ban wearing masks at public gatherings, but it only fuelled the anger of protesters who escalated protests citywide. The High Court in November declared the law unconstitutional, dealing a blow to the beleaguered city leader and government. During her latest duty visit to Beijing last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping assured Lam of his full support, praised her courage and commitment, but also told her to end the violence and chaos. Chan Tong-kai Chan Tong-kai Hong Kong student Chan Tong-kai, 20, is the man whose case sparked the ill-fated extradition bill. Chan reportedly admitted to Hong Kong police that he killed his pregnant girlfriend Poon Hiu-wing, a 20-year-old Hongkonger, during a trip to Taiwan in February last year, and then flew back to Hong Kong. Because the death occurred on the self-ruled island, Hong Kong authorities could neither charge Chan, nor extradite him, as there was no extradition agreement in place. Hong Kong prosecutors could only charge him with money laundering, for using Poon’s finances upon his return home. After spending 19 months in jail after being found guilty, Chan was released from prison on October 23. He apologised to the victim’s parents and the general public, and said he wished to surrender himself to Taiwan. Reverend Canon Peter Koon Ho-ming, a top Anglican priest who played a key role in persuading Chan to surrender, said Chan had originally bought tickets to Taiwan, but cancelled them because of the uncertainty ahead. Koon said Chan wanted to spend time with his family before heading to Taiwan. To ensure Chan would be fairly treated, and not turned into a political pawn, Koon said they would consider postponing his voluntary surrender until after Taiwan’s presidential election in January. In a message sent to reporters on Wednesday, Koon said that plan had not changed, and he would tell the press once a date had been confirmed. Junius Ho Junius Ho Hong Kong lawmaker Junius Ho Kwan-yiu, 57, was the most Googled local public figure in the city this year. Ho became a hate figure among anti-government protesters after he was filmed shaking hands with men believed to have been involved in a vicious attack on protesters and passengers at Yuen Long MTR station on July 21. Ho said he was simply greeting one of his supporters, and defended the white-clad men, saying they were merely “defending their homes and people”. In the days that followed, his parents’ graves in Leung Tin Village in Tuen Mun were vandalised, and his office in Tsuen Wan was also trashed by masked protesters. Ho was stripped of an honorary law degree that he was awarded in 2011 in late October by his British alma mater, Anglia Ruskin University in East Anglia, which voiced concerns about his controversial conduct. But in December, he received an honorary doctorate from the China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing, which described Ho as a “patriot”. During a campaign event on November 6 in Tuen Mun for the city’s district council election, Ho was stabbed, and a 30-year-old unemployed man, Tung Pak-fai, was subsequently arrested and charged with attempted murder. The pro-establishment legislator lost in the November 24 district council election in the Lok Tsui constituency of Tuen Mun to Democratic Party member Cary Lo Chun-yu. His defeat was celebrated by anti-government protesters. Jacqueline Wong and Andy Hui Jacqueline Wong and Andy Hui Apart from the political storm, Hong Kong actress Jacqueline Wong Sum-wing, 30, and singer Andy Hui Chi-on, 52, made headlines in April when their cheating scandal caught Hongkongers by surprise. In a 16-minute video released on April 16, Hui, married to Hong Kong superstar Sammi Cheng Sau-man, cuddled and kissed Wong, who was in a relationship with actor Kenneth Ma Kwok-ming, in the back of a car. The video immediately went viral, and Hui apologised in tears at a press conference that day. One day later, Wong issued a statement saying she was ashamed of her actions. Following the scandal, the American-born actress decided to take some time off her acting career and left for the US. Wong entered Hong Kong’s entertainment industry after winning the first runner-up title of Miss Hong Kong 2012, and represented the city in Miss World 2013. Hui’s wife Cheng, 47 and dubbed the “queen of Canto-pop”, broke her silence two days after the footage emerged and said she forgave him and would not be ending their five-year marriage. Wong returned to Hong Kong on December 14, and said she hoped to move on from the scandal, and is expected to restart her acting career. 	SCMP

It was the latest in a series of attacks by anti-government radicals, piling on woes in a year when the rail giant should have been celebrating its 40th anniversary. Inside Hong Kong’s vandalised MTR stations Inside Hong Kong’s vandalised MTR stations The MTR Corp began 2019 hoping to put a scandalous 2018 behind it, after a series of management crises and construction problems resulted in delays and budget overruns for the Sha Tin-Central rail link, the city’s most expensive rail project at HK$99.1 billion. Heads rolled, and this year Rex Auyeung Pak-kuen and Jacob Kam Chak-pui took over as chairman and CEO respectively.  But 2019 has turned out pretty awfully for the rail operator, which serves 5 million passengers a day and once boasted a near-perfect punctuality rate of 99.9 per cent. “All the mishaps such as its management blunders and handling of the social unrest have taken a toll on the long-standing reputation of the MTR,” said newly elected Kwai Tsing district councillor Leung Chi-shing, a train driver on the Tsuen Wan line. Hong Kong's MTR trains crash during signal test Hong Kong's MTR trains crash during signal test The year began with revelations in January about unauthorised changes and missing documents that raised major safety concerns over the Sha Tin-Central link, on top of earlier allegations of a cover-up of shoddy construction on the project. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor ordered an ongoing commission of inquiry to extend its investigation to cover the new allegations.  In March, images of smashed doors, twisted steel poles and shattered glass shocked Hong Kong as news broke of a train crash, the first on the MTR system. Two vehicles, carrying no passengers, collided during an overnight trial run of a new HK$3.3 billion (US$420.4 million) signalling system meant for seven rail lines. One carriage was derailed, and both drivers had to be sent to hospital.  The accident caused a two-day breakdown in service on one line between Admiralty and Central, two major stations on Hong Kong Island. In July, after months of investigation, the MTR blamed its software contractor, French multinational Thales, for the crash, saying it implemented a software change before any site or simulation tests. Actually the MTR is a real estate firm with a side business as a transport operator. Its profits mainly derive from its property business Lawmaker Michael Tien But the government slammed the rail company for being too reliant on its contractor, and disregarding two warnings from an independent safety assessor about compliance problems in Thales’ software development process. Worse was yet to come. When anti-government protests first broke out in June against the now-withdrawn extradition bill, the MTR Corp was mostly not involved. In fact, it increased services when major protests happened, to help people get home. In August, however, it came under scathing attack by mainland Chinese state media accusing the company of facilitating mob action by laying on extra trains. It then began shutting stations near protests and curtailing services. Protesters quickly labelled it the “Communist Party Rail” and it became a key target of radicals’ destructive fury, for bowing to pressure from Beijing and, as they saw it, colluding with the police. MTR train carrying passengers derails in Hong Kong MTR train carrying passengers derails in Hong Kong In September, the city’s most serious rail accident in more than two decades occurred near Hung Hom station. Three carriages derailed as a 12-car train carrying more than 500 passengers was entering the station. Five passengers were sent to hospital. The company conducted an investigation involving overseas experts, but has yet to reveal its findings. The following month, stations were targeted anew by protesters. When the government announced a ban on masks on October 5, rampaging mobs attacked stations, causing extensive damage. The entire rail network was shut down for the first time in its 40-year history. Through most of October and November, the rail operator closed stations early to get damaged facilities fixed, though critics accused it of imposing a de facto curfew on the city. As of November 24, radical protesters had caused extensive damage to 85 of 94 MTR stations, and 62 of 68 Light Rail stops. Turnstiles, ticketing machines, surveillance cameras, lifts, escalators and rolling shutters were damaged. Some 54 heavy railway trains and 16 Light Rail vehicles were damaged. Passenger numbers are also down since July, falling by 27.4 per cent in October and 27.2 per cent in November compared with the same months last year. MTR Corporation reveals it will incur HK$1.6 billion in costs from protests 6 Dec 2019 MTR Corporation reveals it will incur HK$1.6 billion in costs from protests 6 Dec 2019 Earlier this month, the MTR announced more bad news – the opening of the cross-harbour section of the Sha Tin-Central link would be further delayed until the first quarter of 2022, from the end of 2021. It blamed vandalism of the East Rail line by radical protesters for hindering work. It also expected a significant decline in profits this year, saying it would incur HK$1.6 billion in costs as a result of lower revenue from train services, spending HK$500 million to repair damaged facilities, incurring extra expenses to bolster security, and giving concessions to its retail tenants. Aside from protest-related losses, MTR’s 2019 results have also been hurt by HK$2.43 billion in provisions related to the Sha Tin-Central link construction scandal, and a joint venture in Britain called First MTR South Western Trains. Hong Kong MTR High-speed rail problems revealed in leaked photos and videos Hong Kong MTR High-speed rail problems revealed in leaked photos and videos Questions are being asked about the future of the company, which has reaped a net profit exceeding HK$10 billion in each of the past five financial years. Quentin Cheng Hin-kei, spokesman for commuter concern group Public Transport Research Team, said: “The MTR has given the public the impression that it toes the line of the government instead of serving the public.” He said the early station closures had effectively driven away passengers, who had turned to buses and ferries instead. “The closure of stations and reduced number of customers has also had an impact on the rental income of its shopping malls,” he said. He said now that protesters have linked the MTR with the government, the rail company can expect more trouble while the political unrest continues. “The protesters will continue to vent their anger on the rail firm,” he said. MTR risks losing future contracts in Australia over Sydney metro chaos 6 Nov 2019 MTR risks losing future contracts in Australia over Sydney metro chaos 6 Nov 2019 Cheng added the MTR had also failed to restore public confidence in its reliability, given the cost overruns and delays for the Sha Tin-Central link, and serious incidents such as the train crash and derailment. “I feel pessimistic about the MTR,” he said. “The management revamp is just old wine in new bottles. The MTR has become complacent with its monopoly of the rail service. It just keeps blaming other parties without improving itself.” He said the government should either sell its 75 per cent stake in the corporation to investors and give it complete autonomy, or buy back the remaining 25 per cent and take full control. “The MTR is a monster. It is only partially privatised but controlled by the government,” he said. “Who is it accountable to – the government or its customers?” However, lawmaker Michael Tien Puk-sun, former chairman of the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC), remained positive about the MTR’s long-term prospects, given the support it receives from the government. “The protests and the Sha Tin-Central link construction scandal are just single incidents that won’t happen every year,” he said. “Actually the MTR is a real estate firm with a side business as a transport operator. Its profits mainly derive from its property business.” Tien expected the government to grant the MTR Corp development rights instead of operation rights on future rail projects such as the Tuen Mun South extension, guaranteeing long-term profitability. Jason Chan Wai-chung, head of research at uSMART Securities, said the protests were only a minor setback for the MTR as commuters still relied on its rail service as their main mode of transport. “The MTR holds the monopoly of the city’s railway services. Despite its tarnished image, there won’t be a big impact on its patronage next year. The recent slowdown in protests and its resumption of normal services will help restoring its profits,” he said. However, he agreed that recent mishaps might reflect governance problems. “The safety incidents may have something to do with ageing systems and facilities. The MTR is faced with the challenge of maintaining the quality of its maintenance of facilities,” he said. MTR Corp blames vandalism for delay on cross-harbour section of rail link 4 Dec 2019 MTR Corp blames vandalism for delay on cross-harbour section of rail link 4 Dec 2019 Chan said that to restore public confidence over the MTR’s network safety, the government should enhance its supervision of the railway operator.

Tam Kin-chiu, vice-chairman of the pro-Beijing Hong Kong Federation of Railway Trade Unions, argued that protest-related vandalism had affected the MTR’s service, but not its reputation. But he felt the MTR management should improve its communication with its own staff. “The occurrence of mishaps shows a real need for the company to hold regular talks with the frontline staff, to learn their difficulties and concerns,” he said.

On Friday, what used to be a roofless footbridge near Wan Chai Sports Ground on Gloucester Road in Wan Chai was enclosed with metal grids. A short walk away in Causeway Bay, another crossing near the Wan Chai East Preliminary Water Treatment Works Plant had been similarly altered. Both sides of a roofed footbridge were shielded near the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts in Wan Chai, while construction continued at others. A footbridge near the Kowloon entrance of the Cross-Harbour Tunnel in Hung Hom was lined with metal fences. Another one nearby already had water barriers along it. The alterations are the latest development in a city rocked by more than six months of protests. The demonstrations, triggered in June by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, have evolved into a wider anti-government campaign with the level of violence escalating between protesters and police. protests extradition bill Radical protesters last month used the footbridges at the tunnel to their advantage as they heeded online calls to try to paralyse the city, closing the main vehicular route between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. They were also holed up at the adjacent Polytechnic University, sparking a 13-day police lockdown of the campus, with the two footbridges serving as strategic locations.  Days before the PolyU siege, protesters occupied Chinese University in Sha Tin, where a footbridge on the campus overlooking Tolo Highway, the artery that connects Kowloon and the eastern New Territories, became a battleground between radicals and riot police. Protesters plan New Year's Day rally after Christmas clashes Protesters plan New Year's Day rally after Christmas clashes Masked mobs set up roadblocks and hurled objects from the footbridge at vehicles below. “In light of the request from the relevant department(s), the Highways Department has installed fences on footbridges crossing Gloucester Road and toll booths of the Hung Hom Cross-Harbour Tunnel to prevent people from throwing objects onto adjacent roads,” a Highways Department spokesman said.  But incoming district councillor Leo Chu Tsz-lok, of Tsim Sha Tsui East, said the alterations would not solve the political crisis unless the government responded to protesters’ demands.  “Locals were furious. They felt like they were imprisoned,” he said. On a Wan Chai footbridge, residents wrote slogans such as “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times” on small padlocks and locked them to the grids. The messages were blacked out with marker pens and workmen had cordoned off a section with locks and appeared to be removing them. An IT worker, who gave his name as John, said: “Other than looking rather ugly, I’m not sure what the government is trying to block by putting up this cage at this location.”   He said the government was trying more ways to prevent people from expressing their opinions while continuing to ignore the people’s voices. “Besides, if the protesters wanted to take it down, I think they could make quick work of it. This might actually cause even more strange problems,” he added. A 31-year-old surnamed Chan, who works in purchasing, was also dismissive. “There are many ways to block roads, and not many people even use this footbridge,” he said. “If the government wants to cover it up, they might as well make a roof so pedestrians can be sheltered from the rain.” 	SCMP

A letter on Friday from the Civil Service Bureau to the Legislative Council showed that between June and November, frontline officers and back-end clerical staff, including those who had carried out tasks beyond their job description, were given allowances worth HK$85 million. Another HK$50 million (US$6.4 million) was spent on meals, but officers deployed in the field and unable to get food were later provided with lunchboxes, with a police source saying this had run up a further HK$100 million bill. A police spokesman said the daily rate of food allowance for each person ranged from HK$69 to HK$137. He did not give the figures for both the job-related allowances and food allowances for the same period last year. Protesters plan New Year's Day rally after Christmas clashes Protesters plan New Year's Day rally after Christmas clashes The figures were made public two weeks after the Security Bureau disclosed the government had paid about 11,000 police officers overtime wages of up to HK$950 million (US$122 million) over the past six months.  It is unclear how much of the HK$235 million can be attributed to police work on the anti-government protests, with opposition lawmakers chastising the bureau for failing to provide a fully itemised breakdown. Previous years’ figures did not give a breakdown on meal allowances and the force did not respond to queries. A check by the Post of the 2019-2020 budget showed that “unspecified allowances and job-related allowances” amounted to HK$430 million. Post [Officers] should be compensated for the work they have done to uphold law and order in Hong Kong Regina Ip, lawmaker Hong Kong has been embroiled in protests since June, triggered by an unpopular extradition bill that was withdrawn in September. The unrest, now into its seventh month, shows no sign of ending.    The city’s 30,000-strong force had been stretched to the limit, police top brass said, sometimes working day and night and on public holidays to contain the demonstrations. But as the protest movement has increasingly shifted its focus onto allegations of police brutality, officers’ pay has come under recent scrutiny by opposition lawmakers. The Civil Service Bureau’s letter was in response to pro-democracy legislator Eddie Chu Hoi-dick’s request for further details on overtime wages. The letter said that one of several criteria in the civil servants’ guidelines stated members of the disciplined forces could claim “job-related allowances”, if he or she carried out duties different to their job nature and rank. Another rule permitted allowances to be granted when there were justifiable “special and unique” circumstances, the letter said. Those who earned less than HK$105,000 per month were eligible for the allowances, which had been granted to dog trainers, drivers, divers, undercover officers and police detectives, as well as officers responsible for protecting public officials. Former secretary for security Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee said everyone should be compensated for their work according to their conditions of service. New Hong Kong’s police chief on duty after China appointment amid ongoing protests New Hong Kong’s police chief on duty after China appointment amid ongoing protests Officers had worked extremely hard at all hours over the past months, she said. “They should be compensated for the work they have done to uphold law and order in Hong Kong,” she added. A police source said it was part of regular expenditures and came under existing mechanisms. There had been a lot more meal claims because police were working long hours dealing with the protests. “It is not a new or extra allowance,” he said. Some plain-clothes officers had been assigned to driving duties but had not put in claims, despite these tasks not being part of their job description, he added. Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting agreed it was not something new. “But the question is whether the amount is appropriate, how many people have received it and whether it is related to the work of suppressing the protests,” he said. Lam said the bureau had provided insufficient details, a view echoed by Chu, who said this was precisely why opposition lawmakers had raised a motion in Legco to summon the police commissioner. “It is to stop the force from releasing details little by little,” Chu said. He said he would continue to write to police and join other opposition lawmakers in pressing for more details during coming meetings at the financial committee when they would gather to discuss salary adjustments for civil servants.

Its contribution is trusted and valued by society,” the letter read. “RTHK reporters and cameramen remain at protest scenes ignoring all safety risks to get footage of great news value. It is unreasonable if its part-time employees and drivers face job cuts in such a time.” Earlier this month, the RTHK Programme Staff Union claimed the station had cut the jobs of its part-time employees and drivers after exceeding its annual budget by HK$5 million. The union said it was difficult to estimate how many part-time employees had been cut, but confirmed about 30 per cent of drivers had lost their jobs. Citing the police force’s claim of HK$950 million (US$122 million) in overtime payments over the past six months, the advisers complained the government treated the force and the station differently, even though both serve the public.  Among the signatories were barrister Randy Shek Shu-ming, lawmaker Shiu Ka-chun, and president of the Information Technology Federation Francis Fong Po-kiu. Members of the panel serve for a period of two years and come from academia, arts and culture, legal, and various other sectors. Government supporters target journalists at RTHK headquarters 29 Oct 2019 Government supporters target journalists at RTHK headquarters 29 Oct 2019 The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau said in a statement RTHK had always received enough funding to carry out its work. Over the past nine years, RTHK’s accrued expenses had increased by 117 per cent, which was higher than the increase in government expenses, while public servant positions had increased by only about 40 per cent, the bureau said. The RTHK Programme Staff Union said it was glad the advisers had spoken up for the workers.  RTHK reporters started live-streaming from protest scenes and other news events earlier this year, which increased its number of Facebook followers from 100,000 to 780,000. Job cuts at such a time were like “punishment for workers despite their good performance”, the union said.  “We just want the government to treat us fairly. If police are getting HK$950 million in overtime pay for protest-related work, we also hope to have a corresponding increase in our resources for news production,” the union said. RTHK head rejects allegations that coverage favours Hong Kong protesters 29 Oct 2019 RTHK head rejects allegations that coverage favours Hong Kong protesters 29 Oct 2019 Ng Man-yee, head of RTHK’s corporate communications and standards, admitted some part-time employees had been laid off, but said the broadcaster had not exceeded its budget and instead had reallocated resources in its news department. “We appreciate the concern of the advisers. As the situation in the future may not be as intense as during the last few months, we may not need as many part-time workers, who are only hired when they are needed,” Ng said, adding RTHK had not cut the jobs any of its permanent employees. In 2013, the government submitted a HK$6.06 billion proposal to the Legislative Council for the construction of the new RTHK headquarters in Tseung Kwan O. But the proposal was shot down by pro-Beijing lawmakers who found the cost was too high, even after it was reduced to HK$5.3 billion. 	SCMP

But Senior Superintendent Kelvin Kong Wing-cheung of the police public relations branch dismissed claims that a third officer in disguise was hit with a baton during one of a number of protests in shopping centres. protests “It was very chaotic and in the past few days, most of these circumstances happened in shopping malls, where there was a large number of rioters and our officers,” Kong said, adding that officers were sometimes mistargeted. During a mall protest in Sha Tin on Christmas Day, Chief Superintendent Rupert Dover was hit by police pepper spray during a clearance operation. Protesters plan New Year's Day rally after Christmas clashes Protesters plan New Year's Day rally after Christmas clashes Kong said police were limited to using batons and pepper spray inside malls and no great harm would have been done to protesters or officers. Kong also confirmed that some plain-clothes officers were involved in an ambush in Tai Po on Thursday, after receiving intelligence that protesters planned to cause trouble in a mall. Hong Kong police admit officer showing reporter’s ID live on camera was ‘inappropriate’ 27 Dec 2019 Hong Kong police admit officer showing reporter’s ID live on camera was ‘inappropriate’ 27 Dec 2019 News footage showed a group of riot police officers intercepting masked individuals outside Tai Po Mega Mall. One masked man armed with a baton was grabbed by a riot police officer, but was released after shouting “same team”.  Another masked man was hit on the leg with a baton. Some internet users had questioned whether police were able to effectively identify their own officers in plain-clothes or undercover. Kong said the plain-clothes officer was let go and the person hit with the baton was later arrested, dismissing suggestions he was also a policeman.  Police said they made four arrests during the Tai Po operation for offences including disorderly behaviour in a public place, and obstructing and assaulting officers on duty.  Between Monday and Wednesday, 336 people were arrested during various protests for offences such as illegal assembly and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Police said they used 76 rounds of tear gas and fired a total of 61 rubber bullets, beanbag rounds and sponge grenades in the same period. Meanwhile, police also admitted that some officers sported identification cards with the same number in recent operations. The blue cards, each printed with a unique set of numbers, are part of a scheme rolled out by the force in November to make it easier for the public if making complaints against officers. Senior Superintendent Wong Wai-shun said he had contacted the commander of the unit concerned, and concluded that the act was not intentional. “It was just an [administrative] and logistic hiccup,” Wong said. He did not explain how the mistake was made, only that officers had been told to check all cards. 	SCMP

Andrew Yao Cho-fai, a US-educated industrialist who chairs a listed company trading reinforced steel to serve the city’s construction needs, has been serving the National People’s Congress for seven years. He is expected to start his three-year term at the university from January next year. “The Lingnan spirit, which is marked by passion, loyalty, perseverance, openness to different ideas and readiness to serve, has deeply impressed me, I will do my utmost to work with all colleagues and students to scale new heights of achievement,” Yao said in a statement. Rex Auyeung quits post at Lingnan University a year early 8 Oct 2019 Rex Auyeung quits post at Lingnan University a year early 8 Oct 2019 Yao was a council member at Lingnan for three years from 2013. He is also a deputy chairman in the council of Baptist University, a committee member of the Hong Kong Scholarship for Excellence Scheme, and a board member of Fudan University. In August, he issued a statement condemning protesters’ action of throwing the Chinese national flag into the sea. “The behaviour of some radical demonstrators has become increasingly insane, as they treat the law as nothing,” he had said.  His predecessor Rex Auyeung, who was in charge of the university since 2014, stepped down a year ahead of the end of his term in October, saying he wanted to “focus more on other public service”. Auyeung became embroiled in controversies amid the protests sweeping the city, when he was asked by students and protesters to remove Junius Ho, a controversial pro-Beijing lawmaker, from the university’s council. The calls were made despite Auyeung’s letter to Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung in late July, urging him to find out whether Ho had any role in the attack on protesters and passengers at Yuen Long railway station on July 21.  Hong Kong’s universities have been at the centre of the storm throughout the six months of social unrest. Among 740 university students arrested over protests since June, there were some 30 pupils of Lingnan, according to figures released by police earlier this month. Lingnan University president attends Yuen Long protest with colleagues 27 Jul 2019 Lingnan University president attends Yuen Long protest with colleagues 27 Jul 2019 Education minister Yeung on Friday welcomed Yao’s appointment, while Lingnan’s president Leonard Cheng Kwok-hon hoped the university would achieve its strategic plan targets and realise its vision as a leading Asian liberal arts university under Yao’s leadership.  Representatives of the university students’ union hoped Yao’s role at the National People’s Congress would not affect his impartiality when discharging his duties as Lingnan’s council member. “I hope his political stance will not override students’ interest while making decisions, especially on protest-related issues,” Yanny Chan, general secretary of the union’s current affairs committee, said. She urged the new chairman to host special council meetings and discuss with the Education Bureau whether it was possible to remove Ho from his post in the council. Education sector lawmaker Ip Kin-yuen also said Yao should steer clear of politics in his decision-making to ensure the university upheld its autonomy in teaching and research. 	SCMP

The incident happened on Thursday inside a shopping centre in Tai Po, which police had entered to clear a group of black-clad protesters. Chan, who was live-streaming the operation with a camera, asked whether some masked men armed with batons were police officers. “These officers are wearing no warrant cards and you cannot tell who they are,” Chan was heard saying in a video published by Stand News.

For about 40 seconds, Chan’s name, ID card number and date of birth were visible to the about 10,000 viewers. Chan said the officer could have violated the city’s privacy laws, but the officer blamed the reporter for keeping the camera rolling. Speaking after the incident, Chan alleged that it was the officer who told him to film the inspection. “After I pointed the camera towards him, he placed my ID card front and centre before the camera,” Chan said. He said he planned to file complaints with the watchdog and the police force. The Hong Kong Journalists Association and the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association said in a joint statement on Thursday that the officer had deliberately shown the reporter’s ID card on camera. “To make the reporter’s personal information public … is no different from doxxing,” they said.

227	https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3043591/hong-kong-bar-association-chairman-philip-dykes-confirms-he	2019-12-27	Hong Kong Bar Association chairman Philip Dykes to assume office for a third term	The vocal leader of Hong Kong’s barristers will assume office for a third consecutive term, breaking a convention of the past three decades. Human rights lawyer Philip Dykes, elected to the chairmanship of the Hong Kong Bar Association in January 2018, on Thursday confirmed he would run for a second re-election, a decision which evoked a mixed response from members of the legal profession. Hong Kong’s lawyers left out in cold as relationship with mainland deteriorates 3 Oct 2019 Hong Kong’s lawyers left out in cold as relationship with mainland deteriorates 3 Oct 2019 Dykes will assume the one-year position unopposed from January next year as no last-minute nominations were received on Friday. He will lead the body, representing more than 1,500 barristers, for another year at a time of intense social unrest which has put Hong Kong’s legal system to the test. During Dykes’ tenure, the association had been critical of the government for its attempts to push through the now-withdrawn extradition bill, which would have allowed the transfer of suspects to other jurisdictions, including mainland China, for trial. It has argued that part of the arrangement had failed to protect the rights of fugitives if they were sent to the mainland. Dykes, who also led the association for two years from 2005, said he decided to run again at the request of some fellow barristers.  The association’s constitution allows the chairman to hold the office for a maximum of three consecutive terms, as former top court judge Henry Litton did in the 1970s and Martin Lee Chu-ming did in the 1980s. Lawyer accuses Bar Association of siding with protesters 8 Sep 2019 Lawyer accuses Bar Association of siding with protesters 8 Sep 2019 But most chairmen since the 1990s have typically held office for two years. “We are in an exceptional time,” Dykes told the Post over telephone on Thursday. Citing his frequent visits to legal bodies abroad that are concerned about Hong Kong, he said: “It’s important not to lose continuity with those associations.” Post  A legal source said leading matrimonial lawyer Anita Yip Hau-ki SC would be the sole deputy on Dykes’ ticket, although the association’s governing council generally had two vice-chairs.  Dykes denied it had anything to do with the previous surprise resignation of vice-chairman Edwin Choy Wai-bond. In October Choy, once tipped to succeed Dykes, publicly aired his dissatisfaction with the association for being “highly reticent” in condemning the violent acts of anti-government protesters. “The constitution of the association allows two positions [of vice-chair], but there’s no reason why we can’t function with one,” Dykes said. A separate legal source said the tradition of appointing two deputies was to ensure space for both main streams of civil and criminal practice in the profession. Legal scholar Johannes Chan Man-mun, who is about to step down from the association’s governing council, said Dykes’ term was important as both the city and the profession faced great challenges. “It is important for the association to be vigilant on issues relating to the rule of law,” Chan said. One of the upcoming challenges, he said, was whether Beijing would issue another interpretation overturning a local court judgment on the government’s mask ban, which has thrown into doubt the executive branch’s power to issue the emergency law. Lawyers left out in the cold as relationship with mainland authorities deteriorates 3 Oct 2019 Lawyers left out in the cold as relationship with mainland authorities deteriorates 3 Oct 2019 The legal affairs commission of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) earlier said the power to decide on constitutional matters was solely vested in it. Chan also cited Beijing’s increasing pressure on Hong Kong to legislate the national security law and to end the ongoing social unrest. Former chairman of the association Ronny Tong Ka-wah, now an adviser to city leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, said a third term for Dykes might not be a bad thing given how polarised Hong Kong society had become. “At the very least, Dykes has a known track record,” Tong said. On the possibility of breaking the practice of the past three decades, Tong said: “A convention has to depend on a practical situation, not that it cannot be broken.” But he added a third term for Dykes might create obstacles for lawyers keen to expand their business on the mainland. Former deputy director of public prosecutions John Reading said he was surprised to hear Dykes would run again, noting the two-term convention. He urged the association to remain “entirely neutral” as it had always been, speaking up on matters related to the rule of law when needed. 	SCMP

Beijing declined to reverse its stance, but the two leaders agreed not to let their conflicting positions get in the way of relations, Duterte’s spokesman said after their meeting. “Beijing has increasingly treated the South China Sea as a ‘Chinese lake’ subject to its ‘indisputable sovereignty,’” said Richard Bitzinger, a visiting Senior Fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. “As a result, the South China Sea has become, quite simply, a key defensive zone for the Chinese.” Tensions notwithstanding, the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and China moved a step closer to finalising a long-awaited code of conduct for the waters after completing the first reading of the text in July. The agreement, which is due to be finalised in 2021, would lay out rules of conduct in the disputed waters and processes for dispute resolution. completing the first reading of the text in July INDIA DESCENDS INTO HINDU NATIONALISM INDIA DESCENDS INTO HINDU NATIONALISM In a first for constitutionally secular India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party in early December pushed a bill through parliament that included a citizenship provision based on religion – granting Indian citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The provision was met with protests around the country, and has been challenged in the Supreme Court by two political parties on the basis that it clashes with India’s constitution. Modi’s surgical strike on Muslims puts India at war with itself 17 Dec 2019 Modi’s surgical strike on Muslims puts India at war with itself 17 Dec 2019 The bill follows another major initiative of the Modi government which would require all 1.35 billion people in India to prove they belong on a National Register of Citizens. There are fears that the nationwide implementation of the bill could disenfranchise millions of Indian Muslims. Analysts warn that the resulting unrest could be especially disastrous in light of the economic slowdown the country is facing. India’s economic growth rate has declined for six consecutive quarters, the longest drop-off in 23 years.

Hong Kong’s protest crisis raises career doubts for expats	For one long-time foreign resident of Hong Kong, the city’s violent anti-government street protests this year convinced her it was time to write down a worst-case scenario getaway list. anti-government street protests She noted down the essentials to grab if she needed to flee fast, put the list in a desk drawer in her flat, and found it brought some peace of mind. “It’s a short list,” she said. “Just my mother’s jewellery, my passport and some photos really.” But writing it down, she said, gave a sense of at least being somewhat ready if the conflict reached the point where she had to escape a city she has called home for 28 years. The woman, who asked that her name not be used to discuss the protests, is one of the foreign residents that make up almost 10 per cent of Hong Kong’s 7.5 million population. Many are weighing the risks of staying in a city once known for its stability and now blighted by months of unrest. But so far, there is no evidence of an exodus. Immigration figures show that 731,082 foreigners were living in Hong Kong in November 2018. A year later, the figure was 726,032. This includes domestic helpers, largely from the Philippines and Indonesia, who numbered around 400,000, according to the immigration data.  Foreign professionals working in the finance industry or running businesses in Hong Kong are confronting the “what if” questions about personal safety and protection of children as tear gas, bricks, rubber bullets and firebombings replaced tourists and shoppers on the city’s streets. Contingency plans and “red lines” differ by person and family, but many conveyed the same story of difficult discussions with a partner or family back home about what to do as the protests went from largely peaceful marches in June against a planned extradition law to pitched street battles between police and radical protesters. extradition law  One 33-year-old banker from New Zealand didn’t draw up an escape list, but after long talks with his wife, both decided to look for work elsewhere after four years in the city.  “Our view is that Hong Kong has fundamentally changed as a business centre,” said the banker, who also requested that his name not be used. Have anti-government protests cooked Hong Kong’s financial goose? 26 Dec 2019 Have anti-government protests cooked Hong Kong’s financial goose? 26 Dec 2019 Leaving isn’t the plan for a South Korean-born stockbroker, 30, and his family. He and his Hong Kong-born wife have just had a baby whom they plan to bring up in Hong Kong. But while the city was the right place to be for his career, he did have a red line.  “Unless something like that happens, I will stay in Hong Kong, but there is always a possibility – because we all know that China can make radical decisions,” he said, also requesting anonymity to discuss the issue. Hong Kong’s protests began in reaction to the government’s proposal in February to amend laws that could have led to legal suspects being extradited to mainland China. By June, an estimated 2 million people had taken to the streets in mostly peaceful protests against what they saw as a violation of Hong Kong’s autonomy under “one country, two systems”, a constitutional principle under which the city retains its own political, legal and economic systems for 50 years after the 1997 handover from British to Chinese sovereignty. By July, the protests were turning into regular confrontations with police. On the first of the month – the 22nd anniversary of the city’s return to China – demonstrators stormed into and vandalised the government legislature building. Elsewhere during the month they blocked roads with makeshift barriers, police responded with tear gas, sponge grenades and rubber bullets and once-bustling shopping districts emptied. In the following months, a general strike was called, protesters occupied the city’s airport for several days, two protesters were shot and wounded by live rounds fired by police officers during clashes, and an officer was slashed in the neck with a box ­cutter. Hong Kong marks Christmas Eve with tear gas on streets and protest chaos in malls Hong Kong marks Christmas Eve with tear gas on streets and protest chaos in malls The extradition bill was eventually withdrawn but by then the demonstrations had morphed into broader calls for universal suffrage and other demands, which were rejected by Beijing. November brought even more violence as metro stations and highway toll booths were firebombed, forcing school closures across the city. A third protester was shot and wounded by an officer. Protesters then occupied universities, leading to a siege in which a police officer was shot in the leg by an arrow. The features that attracted many foreign professionals to Hong Kong – safety, stability and leisure – took a massive hit. With Hong Kong one of the world’s leading financial centres, attractive salaries and opportunities now had to be balanced against instability and violence. “The jury is still out. Christmas will be interesting; many people will travel back to their families and there will be discussions about ‘what do we want, what do we do’,” said Tara Joseph, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. “The jury is still out. Christmas will be interesting; many people will travel back to their families and there will be discussions about ‘what do we want, what do we do’,” said Tara Joseph, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. For others, decisions have already been made. One resident, an American army veteran, said he was unwilling to live in a place where “violence [is] condoned” and planned to move to Singapore. “I don’t want my kid to live in a place of fear and I don’t want my wife to live in a place of fear,” said the executive, 39, a US national who was born in Hong Kong. “If you take two different political systems there’s bound to be a reconciliation and this will take time. I personally don’t have the time to participate in it. ... It’s not part of my fight.” A 13-year-old Hong Kong protester shares his story A 13-year-old Hong Kong protester shares his story Most foreign professionals interviewed said they understood the opposition to the extradition bill and supported the calls for democracy by the protesters, but not the violence and vandalism. Others cited concerns about how the protests were being handled by government and police. All felt uncertainty. Anurag Bhatnagar, president of the Forum of Indian Professionals Hong Kong, moved to Hong Kong from India in 1995 and has seen several periods of mass protests since then. “What I was surprised by, though, was the violence – how things took a violent turn,” Bhatnagar said, adding that his views were his own, not the organisation’s. The career commodities trader and tech venture founder said many in his circle were concerned about the demonstrations and frustrated by the government’s lack of engagement. “At the end of the day, every expatriate who moved to Hong Kong has moved for better opportunity for themselves, professionally, personally and for their families. When the future is uncertain, politically, of a particular place, people start questioning that decision,” he said. As many businesses are hurt by the unrest, moving companies are reporting an uptick in inquiries and expect a busier 2020. In many cases, the protests were the tipping point for a move, not the cause, said Lars Kuepper, managing director of moving company Relosmart. “It’s not really because of the protests, but this is the trigger – they have thought about leaving for some time because of the cost of living and education for the children, but the latest developments in Hong Kong made their decision final,” he said. The company handled 125 relocations in October, double the number a year earlier, and about half of those were moves by foreign residents, he said. “We are working seven days a week now,” Kuepper said. Why Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing camp may have to get used to losing 26 Dec 2019 Why Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing camp may have to get used to losing 26 Dec 2019 While there is no evidence of an exodus there are signs that overseas recruitment is slowing. Some multinationals and banks are also looking to diversify risk by moving certain operations out of Hong Kong. “It doesn’t mean they are going to move their whole operation out, but they are drawing up a list and seeing what needs to stay in Hong Kong and what potentially could be moved,” said Stephen West, chief commercial officer of the Hong Kong-based consultancy Quartermain Alpha. He added that it was not unusual for companies to review risk-control strategies, but once they moved it was unlikely they would come back. According to a survey released last month by the Hong Kong Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, more than a third of the 270 companies that responded were considering sending or had already sent the Japanese families of their employees back home. Another 16 firms said they would relocate all of their staff to Japan before the end of the year, and 90 more said they were considering such a move. But others in the international business community stressed a commitment to Hong Kong. AmCham’s Joseph said many major US companies “are devoted to staying here”. A chamber survey published in October showed that less than a quarter of their members were considering scaling back or relocating away from Hong Kong. European Union Chamber of Commerce in China president Joerg Wuttke also said he was “struck” by the optimism of foreign firms about conditions in Hong Kong. For many long-term foreign residents the connection to the city is not just financial but personal and they are keen to see the recovery begin. Bhim Prasad Kafle, vice-chairman of the Nepal Chamber of Commerce Hong Kong, agreed. “[Both sides] have to sit down together at the negotiating table and find a solution. That has to happen, otherwise there is no other way,” he said. Kafle, who moved to Hong Kong 24 years ago to study hospitality management, said he had suffered a 30 per cent drop in business at his restaurant group in the popular Soho area. But he said he was optimistic there would be a rebound for the city. “Hong Kong is always like this – when [business] comes back it comes back fast,” he said. Stay or go: Hongkongers consider emigration options amid protests Stay or go: Hongkongers consider emigration options amid protests Hong Kong’s recovery will hinge on the critical questions that have brought millions onto the streets this year: how will the city define itself in relation to the mainland? “It’s going to take some pretty creative politicians to turn this around and create a vision for Hong Kong,” said corporate lawyer Michael Pepper, who has spent over two decades in the city. “We really need to understand over the course of the next five years what happens beyond 2047,” he said, referring to the end date of one country, two systems set out in the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which defined the terms of Hong Kong’s return to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997. Under the system, Hong Kong’s independent judiciary has contributed to the city’s role as a trusted middleman between foreign business and mainland China. AmCham’s Joseph said the turmoil in Hong Kong had raised some big questions about the future. “You do have to ask the question, honestly, now – we had the colonial era, and the first 20 years after the handover…. and stuff didn’t really change and the privilege of the expats largely remained intact,” she said. “Could we be moving into a third era, where maybe expats can do business, but at a higher risk, if this becomes more of a ‘one country’ and less of a ‘two systems’? “It’s been an emotional year. Everyone is going to spend some time thinking through things, myself included.” Read the first part in the series, on the implications of the pro-democrats’ landslide win in the district council polls, here, and the second part, on the city’s special role as a gateway into mainland China, here.

Speaking on Friday morning, the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, Stephen Wong Kai-yi, said his office had not yet received a complaint, but would “launch a proactive investigation” after what he called “prima facie evidence” the law had been broken. If the subsequent investigation uncovered a breach, Wong said his office would issue an enforcement notice requesting remedial actions to the relevant institution or person, and prosecute if the notice was ignored. Wong was responding after two journalists’ groups in the city condemned the officer’s actions and claimed they had effectively doxxed Stand News reporter Ronson Chan. Chan’s ID card was made visible to some 10,000 online viewers for about 40 seconds during an interaction with police, and he said he planned to file complaints with the watchdog, and the police force. The Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) and the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association said in a joint statement on Thursday that the officer had deliberately shown the reporter’s ID card on camera.  “To make the reporter’s personal information public … is no different from doxxing,” they said. Speaking earlier on Friday, former Independent Police Complaints Council member Edwin Cheng Shing-lung said although he thought the case was an isolated incident, the officer involved was “clearly wrong”.  Wong also called for police to be given clearer guidelines, and training, on how to handle private information. After Christmas chaos, Hong Kong protesters plan major New Year’s Day rally 27 Dec 2019 After Christmas chaos, Hong Kong protesters plan major New Year’s Day rally 27 Dec 2019 In an earlier written reply to the Post, Wong had said he was aware of the media reports surrounding the case, and added “there are justifiable grounds to initiate an investigation”.

Hong Kong marks Christmas Eve with tear gas on streets and protest chaos in malls Hong Kong marks Christmas Eve with tear gas on streets and protest chaos in malls Chan, who was live-streaming the operation with a camera, asked if some masked men armed with batons were policemen. “These officers wore no warrant cards and you cannot tell who they are,” Chan was heard saying in a video published by Stand News. One of the masked men then responded: “There is no identification, so I’m not police.” Chan was then taken aside by other officers and asked to present his press cards and Hong Kong ID card. During the check, another masked officer held Chan’s ID card in front of his camera, which was still live-streaming. Chan’s name, ID card number and date of birth were visible. After I pointed the camera toward him, he placed my ID card front and centre before the camera Ronson Chan, Stand News reporter Chan said the officer could have violated the city’s privacy laws, but the officer blamed the reporter for keeping the camera rolling. Speaking after the incident, Chan alleged that it was the officer in question who told him to film the inspection. “After I pointed the camera toward him, he placed my ID card front and centre before the camera,” Chan said. The reporter, who is an executive committee member at the HKJA, said he planned to make formal reports to the Complaints Against Police Office and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD). Stand News editor-in-chief Chung Pui-keun said the outlet would help Chan make the complaints and that the police would be asked to provide the name and identification number of the officer in question. Student arrested for possessing explosives denied bail 26 Dec 2019 Student arrested for possessing explosives denied bail 26 Dec 2019 Veteran lawyer Dominic Wai, who advises on privacy law, said the officer could have broken privacy laws. “On the face of it, there’s no need for the officer to display the HKID in front of the camera for that period,” he said. In a reply to the media, the force said it respects freedom of the press, but did not touch on the details of Chan’s case. “The police must urge reporters to consider their personal safety when reporting,” it said. In the past, the HKJA has accused police of harassing and physically attacking reporters doing their jobs.

Kwong Wai-pong was among five people charged in different cases at Tuen Mun Magistrates’ Court on Boxing Day, arrested for various offences related to anti-government protests. anti-government protests In the last two days, protesters have taken to streets and shopping malls across Hong Kong to stage demonstrations. Riot police have used tear gas and pepper spray to disperse crowds. Prosecutors said police stopped Kwong outside a Kwun Tong storage facility on December 24. Inside, they said, they found highly flammable nitrocellulose, along with 10 smoke bombs, more than 30 types of chemical and some protest gear. He was charged with one count of possessing an explosive substance and another of possessing an offensive weapon fit for unlawful purposes. Acting principal magistrate Don So Man-lung refused to grant bail to Kwong, who was yet to enter a plea.

Hong Kong has since early June been rocked by anti-government protests, sparked by opposition to an extradition bill which the government has since withdrawn. Clashes have frequently broken out between protesters and police, who have used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon in the face of hurled bricks and petrol bombs, among other projectiles. 	SCMP

The men, aged 19 to 33 and all Hong Kong residents, were accused of involvement in a syndicate linked to the heist. Police warned more arrests could be made. On December 13, four masked robbers looted a watch shop on Fa Yuen Street, Mong Kok, injuring a shop worker with a knife before fleeing the scene. Police said they fled after some passers-by stopped their vehicle from leaving. “Police have looked into multiple pieces of CCTV footage and officers had earlier locked down the group. From December 16 to 25, we arrested five men of Chinese nationality, aged between 19 and 33, whom we suspected were related to the robbery,” said Mong Kok district acting chief inspector Li Ki-chun, adding that the case was still under investigation.

Approaching year-end, business owners should also be more vigilant to avoid being the next target of criminals.” Police said they seized one of the 48 stolen watches and HK$70,000 in cash from the home of one of the suspects during their raids. Officers also found mobile phones and clothes allegedly used by the gang during the crime.  Police chief Chris Tang Ping-keung previously conceded that over the past six months, crime was on the rise, with police attention focused on the increasing civil unrest.

The government issued three sharply worded statements over a 24-hour period to reject accusations by Western media and activist groups of “police brutality” and “state repression”, after tear gas and pepper spray were used over Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day to disperse protesters as radicals resorted to violence and vandalism during chaotic “shopping” rallies at malls across the city. Protesters plan New Year's Day rally after Christmas clashes Protesters plan New Year's Day rally after Christmas clashes Riot police were out in force on Thursday, with officers spraying blue dye and subduing several protesters in Tai Po as groups also gathered in Causeway Bay, Mong Kok, Tsim Sha Tsui and Tuen Mun. Police said they had arrested more than 310 protesters between Tuesday and Thursday, 165 of them on Christmas Eve, including 105 near the force’s headquarters in Wan Chai, on suspicion of taking part in an illegal assembly. A 19-year-old protester was injured after leaping over a railing from the first floor to the ground level of the Yoho shopping centre in Yuen Long to evade arrest that day.  Police published a Facebook post on Thursday morning, warning that “guns have entered the community”. “If members of the public come across any pistol- or rifle-like objects or suspicious articles, please leave immediately and make a report to the police when the situation allows,” the post read.  The government also hit back at allegations that protesters’ rights were being violated with the use of excessive force. 27 Dec 2019 27 Dec 2019 “Violence has indeed escalated in recent weeks, including serious acts that endanger public safety and public order by blocking roadways, paralysing traffic, setting barricades, committing arson, vandalising shops and railway facilities, hurling bricks, throwing petrol bombs, flagrantly assaulting bystanders and violently attacking police officers,” a spokesman said.  “Increasingly lethal weapons including petrol bombs, catapults with steel ball bearings, explosive devices, bombs, bows and arrows have been used by radical protesters who have shown up well equipped with helmets, shields, goggles, respirators, masks, full body armour and protective gear. Such preparations are indicative of their intention to stage violent protests and directly confront and attack police officers, which mitigate the effectiveness and efficiency of lower level of force available to the police through standard anti-riot weapons.” The city’s embattled leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, weighed in with a Facebook post on Wednesday to accuse protesters of ruining Christmas celebrations. The defiance continued on Boxing Day, with dozens of masked activists marching through Tai Po Mega Mall at about 1.30pm, prompting many stores to close. Police restrained at least two men outside the mall and more inside, while one officer was seen spraying blue-dyed pepper spray at a woman at close range. After police took control of the atrium and searched demonstrators as well as reporters at the scene, the Hong Kong Journalists Association condemned a masked officer for demanding and displaying the identity card of a Stand News reporter on camera during the online portal’s live broadcast. The reporter was singled out by police after he chased a baton-wielding man, demanding to know if he was a plain-clothes officer.

The association accused police of harassing and physically attacking reporters doing their job. Police in turn have accused people in press vests of obstruction during anti-riot operations and siding with protesters. Masked protesters also targeted other shopping centres in the city’s tourist districts on Thursday, including Langham Place and Moko in Mong Kok, Sogo in Causeway Bay and V city in Tuen Mun, where riot police pepper-sprayed activists marching through the mall and detained several of them. At the Moko atrium, protesters chanted slogans for hours, including a new one: “January 1, meet at Victoria Park”, referring to a mass rally on New Year’s Day planned by the Civil Human Rights Front, which has organised the biggest protests over the past seven months. They also heckled customers at restaurants and coffee shops owned by mainland Chinese-linked businesses, including Urban Bakery and Pacific Coffee, cheering as people were forced to leave. Armed riot police entered the mall and protesters threw potted plants and black paint or ink at them. Police stopped and searched groups of people as bystanders heckled them. A teenager at the protest who gave her name as Wendy had a message for the city’s leader: “If she thinks we are ruining Christmas festivities, has she thought about who caused this situation in the first place?” A jewellery shop supervisor at Harbour City, where protesters gathered to sing songs and chant slogans, said sales had dropped by up to 50 per cent compared with last Christmas. She was worried about more losses over the coming Lunar New Year holiday, and blamed both protesters and police.

Yeung Wai-sing, chairman of the Association for Hong Kong Catering Services Management, said hotel buffet services during the festive season had been hit particularly hard. “Protests have largely dampened people’s mood to celebrate by going out for luxury dining in busy districts,” he said. Yeung added that several Chinese restaurants in protest-hit areas planned to shut down before the Lunar New Year as their tenancies expired. Jason Wong Chun-tat, chairman of the Hong Kong Travel Industry Council, said the number of mainland Chinese tour groups visiting Hong Kong over the Christmas holidays had plunged to about 10 groups per day on average, only 10 per cent of the number recorded over the same period last year.

Fast forward 10 years, and the 24-year-old has already spent five years working in a local luxury hotel at a Michelin two-star restaurant, and even started to learn French this year. Everything appeared to going smoothly for Tsui – until the extradition bill protests erupted in June, eventually prompting him to put his dreams aside to devote himself to what became the anti-government movement. extradition bill protests erupted in June “What’s the point of becoming an exceptional chef if the authorities have suppressed my hometown and turned it into a totally unrecognisable place?” he told the Post. Post Last month, Tsui became the first chairman of the Hong Kong Hotel Employees Union, which he co-founded with dozens of fellow industry workers, most of whom he met on encrypted messaging channel Telegram. The secondary-school graduate also decided to take English lessons to prepare for any public speeches he may have to make, although the union, in its infancy, has fewer than 200 members. Tsui’s union was one of the many Hongkongers set up as the protests drag on into their seventh month, with many hoping to increase pressure on the government by organising large-scale strikes.  As of last week, at least 24 trade unions had been established this year – almost double the 13 set up in 2018, according to Labour Department figures. That included the Hong Kong White Collar (Administration and Clerical) Connect Union, the Hong Kong Construction and Engineering Employees General Union, the Hong Kong Information Technology Workers’ Union and the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance.  Dozens of other trade unions from a wide range of industries, including optometry, dental, bartending and even beauticians, are understood to be in the pipeline. Most hotel workers in Hong Kong having to take unpaid leave as occupancy rates take hit from ongoing protests, survey finds 17 Sep 2019 Most hotel workers in Hong Kong having to take unpaid leave as occupancy rates take hit from ongoing protests, survey finds 17 Sep 2019 Tsui said these new groups had been working closely with each other and had hoped to change Hongkongers’ perceptions of trade unions.  “We want to introduce a new culture that trade unions are not just about labour rights – they could also consolidate the voices of the industries to resist the authorities,” Tsui said. He said he believed radical protest, while occasionally necessary, had reached a bottleneck, and argued there was a need to bring together millions of Hongkongers to fight the long-term battle and force the government to address their demands. A real strike with no time limit was an option, he said. At least three rounds of citywide strikes have taken place in Hong Kong since August, but they were all focused on disrupting traffic and transport infrastructure over a short time. Stanley Tsang, vice-chairman of Hong Kong Hotel Employees Union, said that even though the city’s residents had become more active in protests over the past several months, a powerful strike was unlikely to happen in the short term. More preparation had to be done, the 31-year-old sales and marketing worker said, adding that his union had recruited some 130 members within a month in a sector estimated to have 40,000 workers and which already has a union affiliated with the Federation of Trade Unions. Tsui said a strike would only succeed if workers did it from the heart, not because they were forced to by traffic disruption. “Trade unions, therefore, have a responsibility to promote the idea and educate the public,” he said. “The more people that take part, the safer it would be for everyone.” Veteran unionist Mung Siu-tat, of the pro-democracy Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, said the group had been offering help and advice to people from almost 50 trades, and called the phenomenon a “citywide political awakening”. He said the confederation’s call for people to set up unions had never been popular in Hong Kong, as many – especially the middle class – still held the perception that such platforms were only for blue-collar workers to handle disputes with employers. “But the political tide has changed it,” Mung said. “Many people who tried to form unions are actually professionals.” 	SCMP

Videos circulating online showed the 16-year-old using both hands to hang onto the wall of the building in Mong Kok, before he fell into a park next door. He was sent to Queen Elizabeth Hospital suffering from hand and leg injuries, and a medical source said he was in stable condition. A police source said the teenager, surnamed Sin, had been drinking before he fell. On Christmas Eve, violent clashes broke out in various parts of the city, including in Mong Kok, where a stand-off between protesters and police on Nathan Road continued into the early hours of Wednesday. Tear gas and pepper balls were fired by police after protesters blocked major roads, vandalised banks and threw petrol bombs at police vehicles.  At about 2am, dozens of riot police appeared on Portland Street near the junction of Cheung Sha Street, and some entered the Jie Genge Taiwanese restaurant. Moments later, videos captured the teenager falling from the restaurant’s balcony. A first-aider who witnessed the incident said he saw a man dressed in grey holding onto the edge of the restaurant’s rooftop, before he suddenly fell with a loud bang, while another first-aider told reporters police had fired pepper balls before the teenager fell.  In a Facebook post, police denied using any force inside the restaurant, and said a staff member had been arrested for obstructing officers, while another two men inside were arrested for offences including unlawful assembly, theft and not having valid identification document during the search.

The city’s largest bank was embroiled in the controversy after police earlier this month froze the crowdfunded capital from a corporate account held by Spark Alliance HK, a non-profit organisation set up in 2016 to help protesters. Police also arrested four people on suspicion of money laundering, who were released on bail within hours.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in was quoted by the Chinese foreign ministry to have stated that the troubled regions were China’s internal affairs during meetings on Monday in Beijing with President Xi Jinping, who also met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. But the line was nowhere to be found in the official statement issued by the South Korean government and, on Tuesday, a spokesman from South Korea’s presidential office, also known as the Blue House, issued a clarification. “President Xi explained that Hong Kong and Xinjiang issues were internal affairs. President Moon said ‘well noted’ in response,” the spokesman Ko Min-jung said. Moon – who has stayed largely quiet on the protests which have rocked Hong Kong for more than six months – was the latest head of state to be quoted by Beijing in supportive terms of its policies. protests Japan’s foreign ministry said Abe had told Xi in their meeting that Hong Kong should “continue to be free and open” and urged China to continue its “self restraint” over the city, while hoping “for an early resolution of the situation”. The Chinese foreign ministry did not refer to Abe’s comments in its statement.  Pang Zhongying, a Beijing-based professor in international relations, said it was obvious that Hong Kong and Xinjiang were deemed priority issues for Beijing in its exchanges with foreign leaders, as the official line was now being included in top level meetings. Xinjiang He added it was no surprise that the issue was presented differently by Beijing and Seoul, as both governments needed to address their domestic audiences. China eager to break Japan-South Korea stalemate 23 Dec 2019 China eager to break Japan-South Korea stalemate 23 Dec 2019 “Beijing would like to explain to the Chinese people how its stance is being presented and received by overseas leaders,” Pang said. “Even when this is not covered in statements with certain countries, it does not mean the topic was not addressed.  “Often, Beijing is trying to present its closeness with another country through the diplomatic language it has adopted in official statements. In this case, Beijing obviously still feels more comfortable with Seoul than with Tokyo, as Japan is a much closer ally with the US on these issues than South Korea,” Pang said.  Since late November, similar lines on Hong Kong and Xinjiang – where an estimated 1 million Uygurs are detained – have been quoted in official Chinese statements following Xi’s meetings with leaders from the Pacific nation Micronesia and Suriname in northeastern South America. China has faced mounting pressure from Western countries – including the US, Canada and the European Union – over human rights concerns in Hong Kong and Xinjiang and was particularly offended by US legislation aimed at its policies there, introduced against a backdrop of already strained relations due to the trade war. China threatens ‘forceful measures’ in response to US bill on Hong Kong rights China threatens ‘forceful measures’ in response to US bill on Hong Kong rights Beijing has repeatedly said that Hong Kong and Xinjiang are internal matters and has accused “foreign powers” of meddling in its affairs for political purposes. On the same day that US President Donald Trump signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act into law, Beijing quoted Suriname’s President Desi Bouterse as saying, during his meeting with Xi, that “Hong Kong affairs are purely China’s internal affairs, and the Surinamese side resolutely opposes and interference in China’s internal affairs”. Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act Following the passage through the US House of Representatives of a bill condemning mass detentions in Xinjiang, the Chinese foreign ministry quoted Micronesia’s President David W. Panuelo as saying that Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet were China’s internal affairs. bill condemning mass detentions in Xinjiang Liu Weidong, a US affairs specialist from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said Beijing was responding to the US moves. “After the US attempted to put issues in Hong Kong and Xinjiang on the international level, China had no other choice but to follow up on an international level to ask for more supportive voices on Beijing’s stance.” Nothing will stand in China’s way, foreign minister assures the nation 24 Dec 2019 Nothing will stand in China’s way, foreign minister assures the nation 24 Dec 2019 Jorge Guajardo, who was Mexico’s ambassador to Beijing from 2007 to 2013, said the statements were a result of hard pressure from China for support from these countries, and a condition of any bilateral meeting. “They negotiate every word prior to any visit and lobby hard, often uncompromisingly, on the issue. When they consider it a core issue (and these tend to change, not just limited to the official core issues) China negotiates with a heavy hand,” said Guajardo, who is now a director at McLarty Associates on Latin America and China affairs. The only other foreign leader to have met with Xi in the same time period was President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, a tiny Central American country which last year switched diplomatic times from Taipei to Beijing. China makes ‘gigantic’ investment in El Salvador projects 4 Dec 2019 China makes ‘gigantic’ investment in El Salvador projects 4 Dec 2019 Bukele paid a state visit to Beijing on December 3 when the two sides published a communique in support of the one-China principle, which recognises that Taiwan as part of China. Bukele and Abe were the only two foreign leaders to meet with Xi in the past month without being quoted on Hong Kong by China’s foreign ministry. “My guess is that China was in damage control mode with El Salvador, fearing the new president would go back to recognising Taipei … They wanted to sweeten the pot, not put him in a position of upsetting the US, so I assume they did not insist on this point,” Guajardo said.

While key details of the events were not included, the video released on the social media account of China’s Central Television military channel, said the drills were conducted “in recent days” without specifying an exact time, or location, or the craft involved. The PLA warship Qinzhou, a type 056 corvette, which has been used in previous Hong Kong garrison naval drills, featured in the video. In 2018, the vessel conducted an exercise with French navy frigate Vendemiaire in waters about 20 nautical miles off Hong Kong, including search and rescue and a communication exercise. The operation was said to raise the defence capability of the troops stationed in Hong Kong. The vessel in the video launched “jamming missiles, to avoid enemy missile attacks” and fired secondary guns at a purported mine. Soldiers, speaking in Mandarin, appeared to take emergency actions as part of the drill, set to dramatic music in the video. Soldiers on the boat wore uniforms and equipment marked as PLA Navy, the maritime branch of the People’s Liberation Army, led by China’s President Xi Jinping as commander-in-chief.

The mall has been a flashpoint for clashes between radicals and police. Earlier this month, hard-core protesters smashed glass panels at the atrium and vandalised restaurants deemed to be pro-Beijing. The mall has been a flashpoint for clashes between radicals and police.  “So when I’m off, I either avoid going out or will just go to nearby shops or restaurants,” Tong added. She said she had no specific plans for Christmas, and her plans to celebrate New Year’s Day in Sai Kung or Mong Kok next week with her family were also cancelled.  “The major concern is transportation. You don’t know when and where public transport will be affected.” Protesters plan to hold assemblies during the Christmas period at several malls in Kowloon, Hong Kong Island and New Territories, in a bid to keep the momentum alive. The crisis was sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill in June but has morphed into a wider anti-government movement.  For Tong, it has become a new normal. “I’m getting used to this,” she said. “These young protesters are polite to us in general ... But I hope there will be no violence.” Over the past months, peaceful rallies have descended into chaos, with mobs throwing petrol bombs and bricks at police, who responded with rounds of tear gas and crowd control weapons.

Unlike on past occasions, there was no Christmas tree and the mall was devoid of festive decorations, while security at its atrium was stepped up. Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping protesters’ confronted by police Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping protesters’ confronted by police Glass balustrades on some floors were still under repair, and others were covered with steel netting. Around 10 security guards with fluorescent yellow vests were seen patrolling on each floor. One told the Post that they were stationed at the mall only for these few days. Post Wing Feng, a mother of two in her 30s, said she felt insecure even going out to shop. “Because I have two kids that I need to think for. So we rarely go out during weekends now,” she said. “Surely I’m not happy – this year’s atmosphere is the worst I’ve seen in the past 13 years.” Feng who came from mainland China, resettled in the city after marrying a Hongkonger. She said her family planned to cross the border for a short trip during the New Year holiday. “There is not much to do in Hong Kong,” she added.

Citing his experience in job hunting, he said he was turned down by initial interviewers because of shrinking headcount. “I didn’t expect the protests to break out when I quit my job one year ago,” he said. “I think recruiters are more cautious about hiring because they want to save money in such situations.” The government said the ongoing US-China trade war and continuing political crisis meant the city’s gross domestic product would shrink 1.3 per cent from last year.

Shenzhen residents Amy Wang and Cissy Chen used to visit Hong Kong for shopping at least once a month. They have not come to the city over the past three months, until Tuesday. “I’m mostly worried about safety and disruption of transport,” Chen said. “We used to come to Hong Kong to buy stuff for our families because it was very convenient.” Chen said tourists from her side of the border were scared off by the anti-mainland sentiments and violence from protesters. “Many fear being beaten up on the street,” she said, adding that her friends cancelled trips to Disneyland resort and Ocean Park recently. Wang said that they came to Hong Kong for shopping because they heard from local friends that the protests had quietened down. “We went to Sheung Shui this morning hoping to buy some cosmetics.

The stand-offs, concentrated in the busy shopping hubs of Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok, dragged into the early hours of Wednesday, with crowds ignoring police warnings and tear gas while counting down to midnight before wishing all – including officers – a “Merry Christmas”. After the bizarre celebrations however, protesters went back to showing there was no love lost between them and police in Mong Kok, as they threw petrol bombs at officers’ vehicles retreating from the scene. In response, police fired a fresh round of tear gas and pepper balls at the crowd.   The force said radicals had also hurled petrol bombs at the police station in Tsim Sha Tsui earlier, threatening the safety of staff inside. Meanwhile, a government spokesman condemned protesters who had smashed traffic lights and blocked roads in the city. “The masked rioters seriously disrupted social order and citizens’ celebrations on Christmas. Their acts are outrageous,” he said.  Earlier, at 11pm in Mong Kok, black-clad radicals had smashed the glass walls of a HSBC branch on Nathan Road and started a fire at its entrance. Some protesters used umbrellas to shield those in the act. Half as many midnight masses for Hong Kong Catholics on Christmas Eve 24 Dec 2019 Half as many midnight masses for Hong Kong Catholics on Christmas Eve 24 Dec 2019 The bank has become the latest target of protesters after a police crackdown on an account used to raise funds for the movement. Officers said the money was channelled into personal gain and illegal purposes. police crackdown    Riot police warned the crowd they were participating in an illegal assembly. By 9.45pm, police again fired tear gas as radicals threw objects such as traffic cones onto the road outside the Space Museum. The stretch was closed off to traffic.   Scores of black-clad protesters then formed a cluster and opened their umbrellas on Salisbury Road in a stand-off with officers. A water cannon sprayed jets laced with pepper solution to disperse crowds.  At nearby Mira hotel, volleys of tear gas were fired, with many people fleeing. A sponge grenade was also later found on Kimberley Road. In Mong Kok, where thousands of protesters packed the junction of Argyle Street and Nathan Road, some radicals started a fire at exit C of the MTR station, while others climbed onto its roof.  In a statement at 10.50pm, the MTR Corporation said Mong Kok station was closed and all trains would skip the stop. Five minutes later, the rail giant also announced that Tsim Sha Tsui station would close. Subway services citywide are running overnight, as is the usual practice on Christmas Eve. Earlier still, trouble had broken out at Harbour City shopping centre in Tsim Sha Tsui as protesters there attacked people they suspected of being undercover officers. When some protesters threw objects at officers who had entered the mall, police pointed their crowd-control weapons at the demonstrators. By 9.30pm, riot police were still stationed at the mall, with more than 50 people, mostly masked, heckling them.   “Where is your conscience?” they asked officers. “Where were you on July 21?” others yelled, referring to the Yuen Long attacks in which police were accused of arriving late to the scene, where white-clad thugs had beaten commuters indiscriminately. Jason Ng, 51, who was at the mall and wearing a mask, said the force should be blamed for the social unrest. “Police should get better training,” he said. “People are just coming out to express their feelings. It’s police who turn these into physical conflicts.” Mall management later asked people to leave through an announcement citing an “urgent situation”.   In Sha Tin, shortly after 7pm at New Town Plaza, where intense clashes between protesters and police previously erupted, about 200 people, some masked, started shouting protest slogans in the atrium area which connects to the MTR station. An 18-year-old student, who only gave her surname as Chan, said she decided to join the gathering to stand up to what she called police violence and keep the anti-government movement alive. At Yoho Mall in Yuen Long, another flashpoint for violent clashes, protesters had also gathered for the evening. Police said a man was arrested at around 8pm, after he fled following a request to be stopped and searched. He was subsequently apprehended, but during the chase, the suspect jumped over a barrier and fell to the first floor of the mall. He was sent conscious to the hospital for treatment. A medical source later said the man was in a stable condition.   On the other side of the harbour at 8pm, more than 100 masked individuals, some in black, gathered in Times Square in Causeway Bay. They chanted: “Five demands, not one less,” together with a growing crowd. Some also waved flags bearing the popular slogan “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times”. Earlier, as night fell, Commissioner of Police Chris Tang Ping-keung visited officers patrolling the streets of Tsim Sha Tsui. Flanked by a group of riot police and other officers, Tang urged radical protesters to refrain from disrupting public order. “Black-clad rioters should not come out and bring destruction – let Hong Kong have a peaceful Christmas,” he said after touring Canton Road, Peking Road and Nathan Road. Citing a recent survey but not naming the source, Tang expressed concern over its results indicating 40 per cent of respondents support the protest violence. “We are concerned and worried about this view,” he said. A poll commissioned by the South China Morning Post showed that a large number of voters in district council elections supported protesters “attacking opponents”, hurling bricks and petrol bombs and damaging public facilities such as MTR stations. poll commissioned South China Morning Post Separately, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor expressed her wish for a safe Christmas for Hong Kong people. “Christmas is a day of joy,” Lam said in a 10-second pre-recorded video on social media. “I wish Hongkongers a peaceful, safe and merry Christmas.” Hong Kong has been roiled by more than six months of anti-government protests, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill.

One of those who still rushed out for a purchase was a mother who only gave her name as Kiki. The advertising executive spent just under HK$1,200 (US$154) on gifts for her two sons and their cousins at Harbour City mall in Tsim Sha Tsui. “I only had time this morning to go shopping because it’s my day off and this is the closest toy store for me,” she said, referring to the Toys “R” Us outlet there. “The toys are quite expensive, which is why our family chose to cook our Christmas dinner at home instead of going out for a hotel buffet like we usually do,” Kiki said. “The safety of our kids is also important. You never know when there’s a protest on the street or inside a shopping mall.” Police will not close roads for festive celebrations in Kowloon, with possible illegal rally 24 Dec 2019 Police will not close roads for festive celebrations in Kowloon, with possible illegal rally 24 Dec 2019 For protesters, there was uncertainty over what action they should take, as a march planned in Tsim Sha Tsui was cancelled, but some had vowed online to press on. In the past two weeks, anti-government demonstrators have staged citywide protests in major shopping malls, leading to clashes with police and those who did not support their cause. Scuffles and violence had erupted at Harbour City and other places such as New Town Plaza in Sha Tin and Telford Plaza in Kowloon Bay.  The movement, into its seventh month, was sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill but morphed into a wider campaign against the government and police. Across Victoria Harbour in Central, Fred Wan, an IT worker in his 30s, was off work around lunchtime. He spent more than HK$2,000 on family gifts such as jumpers, small gadgets and wine. “It was difficult to meet up with friends because we never knew what would happen after work hours or on the weekends,” he said. “There are many discounts at stores but not many mainland tourist shoppers compared with previously.”  For younger consumers, the focus was on food instead of gifts. First-year university student Gloria Wong budgeted HK$1,000 to dine out with friends and family over the Christmas holidays.  “I didn’t buy any gifts for my family this year. I think it’s more important to spend time with your loved ones,” she said while on Nathan Road in Jordan with two friends. In Mong Kok a flashpoint for clashes between radicals and police, those who were out shopping included 17-year-old Form Six student Annette, who spent about HK$200 on chocolates and make-up for friends. “I just like to look around in the shops and eat street food along the way,” she said on Sai Yeung Choi Street South. “I’m having Christmas Eve dinner out in Mong Kok, but I’ll try to get home by 10pm.” A vendor selling luxury brand knock-off T-shirts at the iconic Ladies’ Market, who only gave her surname as Lee, said she would stay open late into the night for any last-minute shoppers or tourists. She estimated that sales had dropped at least 40 per cent in the fourth quarter year on year. In recent months, Lee had to close her stall as early as 8pm instead of past midnight, after the MTR Corporation cut train services amid violent protest clashes in the area. The rail giant has however resumed regular hours and trains will run overnight on Christmas Eve. “In the past, many teenagers would come in early December to buy these trendy shirts for their friends as Christmas gifts. Locals and foreigners would spend about HK$200 on each purchase, while mainland customers spend more than double that because they buy more pieces,” said Lee, who has been operating her business for 27 years. Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping’ protests Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping’ protests Back in Tsim Sha Tsui and along Haiphong Road, which is usually loud and crowded with mainland tourists dragging luggage brimming with shopping hauls, only a handful of customers were seen at outlets around noon. At a store along the stretch, a salesman who only wanted to be known as Tim said his store “has been almost empty every day since mainland tourists stopped coming to Hong Kong in early October”. Panu Phumbatim, 42, an engineer from Thailand who often travels to Hong Kong with his family during Christmas, said it was difficult to make plans as they did not know when protests would break out. He said the streets were quiet and less festive compared to his last visit in 2015. “Last Sunday, we were shopping in Harbour City mall when a man started waving the Chinese flag and people began yelling,” he recalled, “The shops started to close and we hid inside a luxury boutique.” For Phumbatim, coming to Hong Kong this year was a last-minute decision because hotel rates in Tsim Sha Tsui were almost at half price. He intends to bring his children to shop for shoes in Mong Kok, but will avoid Victoria Harbour and Hong Kong Island because of possible protests in the evening. Hong Kong is in a recession under the double whammy of the US-China trade war and the ongoing protests, with the government expecting the full-year gross domestic product to shrink by 1.3 per cent from 2018.

Organisers had already cancelled a planned anti-government march, but internet chatter suggested other night-time actions could be in the offing, and police were on alert for potential unrest. According to the city’s Catholic diocese, only 20 churches were planning to hold midnight masses on Tuesday, compared with 38 last year. A total of 76 Catholic churches were scheduled to hold masses throughout the day. The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Mid-Levels, which held masses at 7pm, 8pm and midnight last year, was set to hold earlier sessions at 6pm and 8pm. Its priest, Reverend Dominic Chan Chi-ming, told local media earlier the arrangement was a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of the faithful in view of the unstable social situation. Call for a Christmas truce from leader of Hong Kong’s Catholics 23 Dec 2019 Call for a Christmas truce from leader of Hong Kong’s Catholics 23 Dec 2019 Hong Kong has been rocked by more than six months of political and social unrest, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill. Peaceful protests have developed since June into violent demonstrations. Radical protesters have blocked roads, damaged MTR stations and occupied university campuses, clashing repeatedly with police. St Joseph’s Church in Central was scheduled to maintain its midnight session this year.  Other chapels, including one at Wah Yan College in Wan Chai, moved their midnight masses forward by a few hours. St Charles’ Chapel, part of the Caritas Medical Centre in Sham Shui Po, was to hold the earliest Christmas Eve mass, at 4pm on Tuesday. Church staff said that was to allow patients to join the mass before meal time at 5.30pm, but did not say if the possibility of protests was factored into the decision.

Protesters online had planned to march in Tsim Sha Tsui late on Christmas Eve. But the march was cancelled after police told organisers it would have to end at 10pm, rather than 1am on Christmas Day, as they had applied for. Organisers also said protesters would have been confined to the pavement. In a post on the online forum LIHKG, which is widely used by protesters, organisers said the march had to be cancelled to ensure public safety.

Wang, who sits on the Communist Party’s policy coordination group on Hong Kong and Macau affairs, said Beijing would remain “consistent, confident and patient” in dealing with what he described as attempts to sabotage China’s development. “On Hong Kong, we have staunchly supported the special administrative region government in stopping the violence, restoring order and governing in accordance with the law. Hong Kong “Time will prove that the ‘one country, two systems’ principle will not only work and work well in Hong Kong, but will also win public support,” he said. Wang noted Beijing’s success in luring more countries to sever their official diplomatic ties with Taipei and hailed his country’s counterterrorism work in Xinjiang, where an estimated 1 million Uygur and other Muslim minorities are in detention. China has denied the figure, but declined to provide an exact number. Taipei Xinjiang  The interview, with party newspaper People’s Daily and central broadcaster CCTV, capped a complicated year for China’s foreign policy. People’s Daily In addition to concerns from abroad over the strained ties across the Taiwan Strait, the months-long anti-government protests in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang internment programme, 2019 was also dominated by trade and technological disputes with the US.  Wang expressed disappointment that the anniversary in January of 40 years of diplomatic ties between China and the US had been marred by US restrictions on China in trade, science and technology, as well as its interference in China’s sovereignty. Such attempts, Wang said, were futile. China and the US  “No one or no force can prevent the 1.4 billion Chinese people from striding towards modernisation,” he said. A year of the US-China trade war A year of the US-China trade war Wang also stressed the importance of maintaining close diplomatic ties with the EU, which labelled China a “systemic rival” in March. “We are partners, not rivals; friends, not enemies,” he said, in an echo of remarks to Brussels earlier in December, that China should be seen as a partner not a competitor. remarks to Brussels Wang framed Europe as a key partner in China’s vision for a multilateral world order which, he said, was in a vital contest with unilateralism “playing out on a global scale”. Europe Wang also highlighted the advancement of Sino-Russian ties in 2019, describing them as the “cosiest and most robust” of all the great power relationships. He noted the growing trade figures between the two countries and the opening earlier in December of the Power of Siberia pipeline which will supply northeastern China with natural gas.

Debate motions such as “Hong Kong people should fight for Hong Kong independence” and “Restructuring the police force does more good than harm” were slammed by pro-Beijing teachers’ union the Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers last week. The HKFEW said such propositions were politicised and inappropriate. More than 120 schools are taking part in the first-ever Hong Kong Secondary Schools Debate Competition, with preliminary rounds running from November to January. Most of the 145 finalised topics were proposed by participating schools and chosen based on criteria including relevance to local and international current affairs and resonance with secondary-school students. But four schools said over the past few days they were pulling out of the competition, citing reasons such as scheduling clashes, organisers said on Monday, adding that it was a “pity”. The withdrawals followed denunciations of the protest-related topics by the HKFEW and pro-Beijing newspaper Ta Kung Pao on Friday. Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping protesters’ confronted by police Hong Kong ‘Christmas shopping protesters’ confronted by police Organisers from the Hong Kong Schools Debate Federation (HKSDF), set up in September by more than 10 members with years of debating experience, said it had no plans to drop any of the topics, saying the competition was “politically neutral and professional”. “Debating has always been a rational and politically neutral activity. No matter what the topic is, both the proposition and opposition sides have to do thorough research and formulate solid arguments so as to win,” said HKSDF organising member Kelvin Yang.  Less controversial topics related to areas such as economics and people’s livelihoods, including “Statutory minimum wage does more good than harm” and “Hong Kong should introduce a wealth tax system”. Another HKSDF member, surnamed Chan, said: “We understand some schools might feel pressurised but many teachers and students might still want to join the competition.” The group added that simply debating the fraught topics did not denote any sort of bias. For instance, it added, the topic on restructuring the police force was debated last Saturday and the team opposing it won.  But it added it was worried more schools would withdraw from the competition under pressure.  Hong Kong has been rocked since early June by protests sparked by an unpopular extradition bill, which have since broadened to calls for greater democracy and police accountability. Demonstrators have regularly clashed with police, who have repeatedly used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon, in the face of hurled projectiles such as bricks and petrol bombs. The competition is sponsored by the Project Citizens Foundation, an organisation co-founded by former politicians and professionals including former chief secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang, a pro-democracy campaigner. HKSDF said the foundation was not involved in selecting debate topics, and had only helped secure and pay for venues. One principal from a participating school said, on condition of anonymity, that most of the 145 topics were insightful and worth discussing, but added that some “more politically inclined” topics might bring politics into schools, even if that was not the aim. Secondary-school students are sometimes immature and might not be too familiar with [political issues]. It is therefore not appropriate to ask them to debate about these topics Wong Wai-shing, vice-chairman of the HKFEW Ta Kung Pao lashed out at the competition in a news report last Friday, describing it as “using debate as a medium to brainwash students”. Speaking on Monday, Wong Wai-shing, vice-chairman of the HKFEW, said he hoped the Education Bureau would actively follow up the issue and notify schools about the “potential risks” of participating. “Secondary-school students are sometimes immature and might not be too familiar with [political issues]. It is therefore not appropriate to ask them to debate about these topics,” Wong said.

It added that if schools had already agreed to participate in such of activities, they should withdraw from the event and explain the reasons behind the move to students. 	SCMP

Polytechnic University University management, which had earlier announced the resumption of classes on January 13, said test results of dioxin levels and cyanide components would be ready within a week. The Hung Hom campus was the scene of violent clashes between anti-government protesters and police, and a resulting 13-day police siege, last month. violent clashes resulting 13-day police siege Radical protesters unleashed chaos in and around the university on November 17, triggering violent exchanges of petrol bombs and tear gas with police. The force declared the unrest a riot, before surrounding the site. Thousands of petrol bombs and other weapons were recovered from the grounds after the siege came to an end on November 29. The latest progress was touched on in a letter jointly issued by president Professor Teng Jin-guang and five vice-presidents, to staff and students on Monday. The management also thanked those who had helped in the restoration work, saying: “During the peak period, about 400 people were engaged in related work daily, including a large number of alumni, from a professional construction company run by [an alumnus], providing voluntary services.”  Professor Teng earlier faced criticism and accusations that he failed to control his institution. In Monday’s letter, management said it “once again, strongly condemns the acts of vandalism and violence on the campus”. Hong Kong's PolyU siege : From beginning to end Hong Kong's PolyU siege : From beginning to end   It also sought to ease staff’s concerns about working on the campus.  “We have carried out preliminary safety assessments of the buildings on campus, including the testing of indoor air quality, filter replacement of air-conditioning systems and assessment of building structural safety, as well as the decontamination of individual buildings. Back on track: protest-hit train station reopens after five weeks 21 Dec 2019 Back on track: protest-hit train station reopens after five weeks 21 Dec 2019 “After internal assessments and testing, some buildings and laboratories were deemed to be safe and were reopened so that colleagues and research students who wished to work there could enter. “About half of the campus is expected to reopen by the end of December, and the rest ... by mid-January next year, so that semester 2 will commence as scheduled on January 13, 2020.” The letter did not mention the cost of the repairs. Professor Teng had earlier said the university would hire professionals to provide an estimate of the costs and he expected a major part of the money to come from the government. Officials have said universities which struggle to pay the huge repair bills could seek help from the Education Bureau or consider applying for funding at the Legislative Council. Last month the government pulled about HK$2 billion worth of separate funding proposals under consideration at the Legislative Council, for use on medical and library facilities at three universities, including Polytechnic University, after some pro-establishment lawmakers expressed dismay that varsity management had, as they saw it, failed to control their institutions, allowing them to become battlefields in the protests.

More than 84 per cent of respondents used digital solutions including online bank transfers (54.3 per cent) and e-wallets (29.8 per cent), the survey of 957 helpers showed. The number of those using remittance centres dropped drastically from 78.4 per cent in 2018 to 10.6 per cent this festive season. Most respondents – 94.3 per cent – said they would send money home for Christmas. Results of the survey, conducted in early December by HelperChoice, an online employment platform, were released on Monday.  HelperChoice manager Mahee Leclerc believed the months of social unrest had partly contributed to the trend. social unrest “The current unrest has made it more difficult to travel around the city, forcing domestic workers to stay at home on their rest day,” she said. “Therefore, this democratises the use of digital solutions such as e-wallets and online banking services to make money transfers.” Hong Kong has been rocked by protests, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, since June. The demonstrations evolved into a wider anti-government movement, with radical protesters clashing with police as the level of violence escalated. Rail and road services have frequently been disrupted. Thousands join rally to condemn crackdown on protest fundraising platform 24 Dec 2019 Thousands join rally to condemn crackdown on protest fundraising platform 24 Dec 2019 “Since rallies happen often on the streets of Central, where we do all our remittances, [have a] meeting place and church activities, I feel hesitant to go there on my days off to avoid being hurt by the protesters or being arrested by police for mistaken identity,” one of the surveyed domestic workers, who switched to an online platform for remittances because of the protests, told the company. Working more than two decades in Hong Kong, Eman Villanueva, vice-chairman of the Filipino Migrant Workers’ Union, switched to a digital wallet for sending remittances about a year ago.  “I think convenience is the most important thing for migrant workers to consider when choosing remittance methods. Because, unlike other workers who can go to banks during lunchtime, migrant workers only have time on Sunday [on their day off],” he said. Call for a Christmas truce from leader of Hong Kong’s Catholics 23 Dec 2019 Call for a Christmas truce from leader of Hong Kong’s Catholics 23 Dec 2019 “So I don’t think the protests are the main reason for the change, but they accelerated the trend because it was more difficult for people to go to remittance centres.”  He estimates more than half of the members of his group use e-wallets for remittances. “A Hong Kong ID, a smartphone and an app are what you need to set up an e-wallet account,” he added. “Once approved, you can send money home immediately and your family can get it within minutes.” Villanueva said the low transaction fees, sometimes zero, were also a factor. “In general, it costs HK$18 to HK$28 for each transaction at a remittance centre. If you use an e-wallet, the exchange rate is similar and they charge lower or even no transaction fees as an incentive,” he said. “Domestic helpers do not earn much. We value every single cent we can save to send home.” Despite the convenience and savings, Villanueva expressed some concerns about using an e-wallet. “What if the money in the e-wallet is lost? What should I do?” he said. “I’m always careful with the online platform although nothing bad has happened to me so far. I do not top up more money than I need to transfer in the wallet.” I do not top up more money than I need to transfer in the wallet.” 	SCMP

Before the authorised rally began at 7pm in Central, there were minor scuffles between protesters and riot police at a nearby pedestrian underpass, when officers checked booths distributing masks to participants. As police left the scene, they were verbally abused by protesters. The organiser estimated 45,000 joined the assembly in Edinburgh Place, near the bank’s Hong Kong headquarters. Police put the turnout at 3,300. Last Thursday, police froze about HK$70 million (US$9 million) raised by activists via the Spark Alliance platform to support protesters and arrested four people for money laundering. police froze about HK$70 million Officers suspect the funds were used for personal gain and other illegal activities, including participation rewards for young demonstrators. But Sunny Cheung, one of the organisers of Monday’s “Sparking the World Afire Assembly” and spokesman for a group called Hong Kong Higher Education International Affairs Delegation, said the police’s action was arbitrary.  “This is actually detrimental to Hong Kong’s status as an international financial hub,” Cheung said. “We condemn the government for using politics to override the economy.” The organiser also called for action against HSBC, which closed Spark Alliance’s bank account in November. Cheung urged the US government and businesses to sanction or boycott the banking giant.

A 52-year-old saleswoman, who gave her name as Catherine, said she had donated a few hundred dollars to Spark Alliance when she joined peaceful gatherings in the past. “The money I donated came from my own hard work at my job, it’s not ‘black money’ at all,” she said. “Police are just using any excuse to cut off support for the young protesters.” Is ‘cockroach’ actually a compliment for Hong Kong protesters? 24 Dec 2019 Is ‘cockroach’ actually a compliment for Hong Kong protesters? 24 Dec 2019 A clerk in her thirties, who only gave her surname as Cheung, made a one-off donation of about HK$1,000 to Spark Alliance via an interbank online payment system. “Even though I made my donation through the bank, I still have a thin line of trust that my account activities will not be handed over to police,” she said. Cheung, who holds an HSBC account, said she was considering switching to another bank. 	SCMP
