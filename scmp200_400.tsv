The 15-year-old was subsequently arrested, a police source said. A witness said riot officers took the girl, dressed in dark clothes, to their vehicle after she was found to be carrying a spray adhesive, which protesters have often used to affix posters and signs supporting the months-long civil unrest. Luke de Pulford, who sits on the British Conservative Party’s Human Rights Commission, said police should be summoned to explain themselves.

Reverend Canon Peter Koon Ho-ming also revealed that more information about Chan Tong-kai’s plans could be released soon. The 20-year-old is wanted on the self-governing island for killing his pregnant girlfriend, Poon Hiu-wing, in Taipei in February 2018. Chan returned to Hong Kong after her death, and served time on related money-laundering charges. He could not be sent back to face murder charges, for lack of an extradition deal between the two jurisdictions. Asked before election results came in if the suspect would change his mind if Tsai kept her job, Koon said: “Since his release, Chan has never left Hong Kong or changed his mind about returning to Taiwan to turn himself in. This would not be affected by whoever wins the election.” Taiwan presidential election: ads reflect contrasting campaigns of hopefuls Tsai Ing-wen and Han Kuo Taiwan presidential election: ads reflect contrasting campaigns of hopefuls Tsai Ing-wen and Han Kuo “We hope to disclose more information soon,” he added.

Under a British proposal, the post-handover government would have had to seek the Legislative Council’s approval before asking Beijing for the help of the PLA’s Hong Kong garrison for the maintenance of public order and disaster relief. It was among a number of suggested amendments to the second draft of the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution. The British government believed it would help restore the confidence of Hongkongers following the June 4 crackdown, in which the PLA was sent into Beijing to suppress pro-democracy protests. An “overall critique” of the Basic Law draft, released in February 1989, said there was great concern about the stationing of PLA troops in Hong Kong. The document, which covered proposals for amending a number of draft clauses, was sent from the Hong Kong government to Britain’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office on October 26, 1989. It suggested revising Article 14, which empowered Beijing to station troops in the city after 1997, in such a way that “military forces may be sent by the Central People’s Government to [Hong Kong] only in time of war”.

A video showing two Mandarin-speaking women on the Hill of Crosses memorial near the city of Siauliai caught the attention of senior government officials. One woman was seen picking the cross up as the other encouraged her to “throw it away”. “[This] shameful, disgraceful act of vandalism is currently under investigation by Lithuanian authorities,” Linas Linkevicius, foreign minister of Lithuania, wrote on his official Twitter page on Sunday. “Such behaviour can’t and won’t be tolerated.” On Sunday, police officers who visited the site to assess the incident after examining videos and photos launched an inquiry, local media said. The dispute between supporters of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement and pro-government voices that prevail in mainland China has escalated to diplomatic levels in a number of countries, including Lithuania. Beijing had not publicly responded to the Lithuanian foreign ministry as of noon on Monday.	SCMP

Tsai Ing-wen “As long as we can forge internal unity to jointly face the current situation across the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and to demonstrate our resolution to uphold our national sovereignty while seeking to maintain cross-strait peace and stability, I believe Beijing authorities will have to deal with Taiwan eventually,” Tsai said. Speaking on Sunday during a televised debate between the three presidential candidates in January’s election, Tsai stopped short of saying how she would forge internal unity, given the sharp political divide between her pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the mainland-friendly camps which have troubled the island for decades. Cross-strait relations dominated the debate as Tsai exchanged fire with populist Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu, from the mainland-friendly Kuomintang (KMT) and James Soong Chu-yu, chairman of the smaller People First Party (PFP).

But, pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung called the claims misleading, and said the world had seen how the law had been “selectively enforced” over the past six months. David Leung Cheuk-yin SC, the director of public prosecutions, hit back in the opening remarks of the Department of Justice’s annual report released on Thursday, and said he was saddened by such a suggestion. It was Leung’s most elaborate public remarks since almost 1,000 defendants were charged in court during the recent civil unrest, although the report mainly focused on prosecutors’ work in 2018, long before the ongoing anti-government protests erupted in June. Leung insisted the department’s role was to minister justice, and distanced his unit from law enforcement, including police officers accused of excessive use of force over the past six months.	SCMP

Latest figures from the bureau showed it received a total of 106 complaints of protest-related misconduct against teachers between June and November. Investigation was completed in about 60 cases and wrongdoings confirmed in 30. The pro-democracy Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union (PTU) said on Thursday about 20 teachers against whom such complaints were filed had sought its help over the past four months. About 17 of the cases were related to comments the teachers had made on social media, and nine have been found to be initially substantiated. The union said in five of the cases, the teachers did not get a chance to respond before being notified by the bureau that their cases had been substantiated, mostly on the basis of information provided by their respective schools. “The EDB has not been able to give fair treatment to people, allow them to understand the whole procedure and to make their statement before making its judgment,” education sector lawmaker and vice-president of the union Ip Kin-yuen said.

Lau Ka-chun, 26, pleaded guilty to one count of possessing offensive weapons in a public place, after he was found in possession of a dagger, an axe, a machete, and a military knife in Yuen Long on September 21. His lawyer Jessica Chan Wing-yin told Tuen Mun Court her client did not own the weapons, but instead kept them for a protester temporarily to “do him a favour”. She said no fingerprints had been found on the dangerous items seized. But acting Principal Magistrate Cheung Kit-yee did not believe that argument, and said Lau could have handled the weapons using gloves or a cloth. She said the defendant might have used the weapons if necessary. The sentence was by far the heaviest handed down in protest-related proceedings since the anti-government movement swept Hong Kong in June.	SCMP

Xi Jinping On the second day of his three-day visit in the casino hub to mark the 20th anniversary of its return from Portuguese to Chinese rule, Xi praised the city’s residents for putting their love of the country and Macau before the core values of democracy, rule of law, human rights and freedom. He also complimented the Macau government for understanding the importance of harmony, unity and consultation, as well as avoiding disputes and internal friction. While he made no mention of Hong Kong, his remarks were once again interpreted as a rebuke of the former British colony which has been rocked by anti-government and anti-Beijing protests since June. Analysts said it was clear Xi was deliberately contrasting his strong approval of Macau with his silent disapproval of Hong Kong ’s performance in integrating with the motherland since its 1997 return to Chinese sovereignty. protests The Hong Kong government revealed on Thursday night that Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor had led a delegation of her officials to meet the president.

A Beijing government adviser says that voting pattern may well be repeated in September 2020 when elections for the more powerful Legislative Council take place. Legislative Council The implications of that scenario are far-reaching, including possibly creating a crisis for the “one country, two systems” structure under which Hong Kong is run, according to Tian Feilong, an associate professor at Beihang University’s law school in Beijing. “one country, two systems” structure “So [the landslide win] by the opposition has effectively ushered in a political process through which [the opposition] would be able to seize power through elections and that would soon trigger a security crisis for the one country, two systems,” said Tian, who has advised China’s leaders on Hong Kong affairs. The pro-establishment camp ran hard in the district council elections, but they were badly punished in an unusually high turnout of voters that left them with 42 per cent of the vote, suggesting they would lose support in September, he said at a seminar in China’s capital early this month.

Lawyers for the woman, named K after she was granted anonymity for fear of having her details shared online, had accused police of obtaining her medical report “behind her back”, depriving her of the right to privacy. They argued that K should be entitled to access to the warrant, when she has called the lawfulness of the police seizure into question, and that a failure to show her that order would prevent her from mounting a direct challenge, thereby infringing her right to access to justice as protected by the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution. But the High Court on Tuesday sided with police, finding that agreeing to her demand would have far-reaching implications. Such a general rule, it found, would mean anyone aware they are being investigated could ask to see a warrant, harming the effectiveness of investigations, which depend on confidentiality and covertness. “A declaration of such free-standing right is ... in my view, not only inadvisable but also unnecessary ... because ... there are established legal mechanisms for the applicant to obtain access,” Mr Justice Godfrey Lam Wan-ho wrote. “It is of significance that the applicant has not pointed to any legal obstruction.”	SCMP
